According to Twitter, Notley is the second-most followed sitting premier, and had more Twitter mentions in 2018 than any other sitting premier except for Ontario’s Doug Ford.

In June 2018, Notley became just the third sitting premier to reach 100,000 Twitter followers. She currently has more than 117,000 followers.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The western Canadian province of Alberta will hold an election on April 16, kick-starting a contest that many polls suggest will result in a change of government in the country's oil-producing heartland as it struggles with a sluggish economy.

Premier Rachel Notley's left-leaning New Democratic Party won a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015, ending 44 years of conservative rule, but inherited a provincial economy rocked by the collapse of global oil prices.

Notley was initially an ally of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and backed his attempts to please the oil industry and environmentalists by championing export pipelines while also introducing carbon pricing.

The relationship soured last year over efforts to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, prompting Notley to pull her support for Trudeau's carbon plan. Ottawa bought the pipeline, whose expansion remains delayed.

The opposition has criticized Notley for her alliance with Trudeau, who is viewed by some Albertans as out of touch with the oil industry's woes.

Alberta's government has grappled with weak oil prices, persistent budget deficits and a dearth of new export pipelines that left the landlocked province's crude building up in storage, resulting in the discount on Canadian heavy crude blowing out to record levels last year.

As a last resort, Alberta took the controversial step of curtailing oil production to help prop up prices and investing in railcars to move more crude to market, a move that earned approval from some cash-strapped producers in the province's dominant oil industry, and outrage from critics.

Announcing the date of the election in the oil industry's corporate hub Calgary on Tuesday, Notley emphasized her government's commitment to health and education and its efforts to revitalize Alberta's economy.

""Since the oil price collapsed I know these last few years have been scary for a lot of families and I have worked day and night with my team to fight this recession and bring our economy back,"" she told supporters.

Opinion polls suggest Notley could be the first one-term premier in Alberta's history, and cede power to opposition leader Jason Kenney of the United Conservative Party, a former top federal cabinet minister.

The UCP have been consistently ahead in the polls since last year. An Ipsos/Global News poll on Tuesday said 53 percent of Albertans would vote for the UCP if an election were held today, versus 35 percent for the NDP.

Notley criticized Kenney for recent allegations that he was involved in an ethically dubious campaign to discredit a rival in the UCP leadership contest in 2017.

Kenney has denied any wrongdoing, but some political analysts say the scandal will dog his party's election bid.

""If you add up the number of actual (UCP) party members to come out and publicly speak against Jason Kenney, this is significant,"" said Lori Williams, a political science professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University. ""But is it going to be enough to shift undecided voters? That remains to be seen.""

In light of the allegations, Notley and the NDP are likely to make issues of integrity, equality and trust a central part of their campaign, Williams said.

Kenney brushed off the scandal, saying his party would be focused on jobs, the economy and getting pipelines built.

""Are you better off than you were four years ago? That's the question Albertans will be asking when they choose their new government,"" he told reporters in Edmonton. ""The NDP has to resort to the politics of personal destruction because they cannot defend the worst economic record in modern Alberta history.""

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

WATCH: UCP leads NDP ahead of 2019 Alberta election

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 per cent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 per cent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

Scandal brewing

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jeff Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

READ MORE: Pipeline politics to affect economy, two elections in 2019, economists say

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University.

Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”",Canada’s battered oil industry cheering for Alberta’s opposition party in upcoming election,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5079770/oil-industry-alberta-2019-election/

This is one of the themes of Orange Chinook, a book I co-edited with my colleagues Keith Brownsey, Richard Sutherland, and David Taras at Mount Royal University.

In several chapters, the book highlights how the last provincial election brought to the fore a number of demographic and political changes that had been bubbling below the surface for years.

Alberta has a reputation as a conservative place, but a progressive evolution has been happening in its largest cities. The 2015 election also saw a breakthrough for women in politics, dramatically shifting what was once a male-dominated landscape. We witnessed, too, the rise of Indigenous activism, an undercurrent that is rising, increasingly, to the surface.

Many of these changes seem permanent, and the net effect appears to be the end of decades-long political dynasties that characterized this province for so long.

In short, Alberta politics is becoming more ""normal"" in the Canadian context.

Toward a two-party system

From 1905 to 2015, Alberta was unique in Canada. It was a province dominated by a single party.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties: Liberals (1905-1921), the United Farmers of Alberta (1921-1935), Social Credit (1935-1971), and the Progressive Conservatives (1971-2015).

Moreover, when the dynasty was finally defeated, it was never really a contender again. The once-dominant party often disappeared entirely.

The 2015 election replicated this pattern. After their defeat, the PCs voted themselves out of existence when they merged with the Wildrose Party to form the new United Conservative Party.

But the situation is now different. If the UCP wins the 2019 election, as polls currently suggest, it's unlikely to govern for 44 years. And the NDP is unlikely to disappear.

Instead, Alberta is moving toward a two-party system, with the NDP on the left and the UCP on the right. With this structure, it more closely resembles the political landscape in other Canadian provinces.

Alberta has never had a party lose power and then come back and win another election. But that day is coming.

And the path to victory for any party, increasingly, runs through Alberta's largest cities.

The rise of cities

Rural Alberta had been the political bedrock of previous political dynasties, but the election of the NDP in 2015 was remarkable for its lack of a powerful rural minister in the vein of Hugh Horner, Marv Moore, Ken Kowlaski or Ed Stelmach.

The NDP, despite winning a handful of rural seats, was widely seen as ""the party of cities,"" as James Wilt describes it in one chapter of the book.

Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, given the success of progressive candidates at a municipal level.

In the case of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, Dave Bronconnier, Al Duerr, and even a young Ralph Klein could not be described as either fiscal or social conservatives. The situation was the same in Edmonton with Don Iveson, Stephen Mandel, Bill Smith, and Jan Reimer.

The longevity of the Progressive Conservative dynasty at a provincial level masked changes that were already underway in Alberta's two biggest cities.

For Roger Epp, who contributed another chapter to Orange Chinook, the fiasco over the NDP's farm workers bill and some insensitive remarks about the carbon tax showed a government that was, in his words, ""post-rural.""

The 2015 election, in Epp's view, put the electoral stamp on a number of trends that had been occurring in rural Alberta: a declining population, the increasing encroachments of urban life, the loss of health and education services, and the rural way of life quickly fading.

Indeed, the percentage of MLAs from rural Alberta has been in a slow but steady decline as urban and suburban populations grow. As recently as 2001, less than half of MLAs came from Calgary and Edmonton. For the 2019 election, when the suburbs are included, it will be two-thirds.

And in both 2012 and 2015, rural MLAs were mostly on the opposition side of the legislature. If the UCP forms government in 2019, a majority of rural MLAs will be back on the government side. But this will not bring back the political glory days. Those days are gone.

So too, are the days of politics being a man's game.

Alberta steps into the future

When Alison Redford won the PC leadership race in 2011, the Globe and Mail carried a notoriously condescending front-page headline: ""Alberta steps into the present.""

But as Lori Williams shows in her chapter comparing the leadership styles of Danielle Smith, Alison Redford, and Rachel Notley, Albertans have had several women succeed in a hitherto masculine environment.

These changes are permanent.

It was Notley — not Justin Trudeau — who introduced the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada.

Meanwhile the UCP, which had been mocked for having more men in its caucus named Richard than it did women, has nominated dozens of women to run in 2019.

The days of Alberta politics being so heavily male-dominated are over.

A final demographic change is the rise of Indigenous political activism.

Indigenous votes

Brad Clark, in his chapter of Orange Chinook, demonstrates the NDP was overwhelmingly supported by Indigenous people in the 2015 election.

In fact, there were three ridings that were significantly impacted by First Nations and Métis votes: Lesser Slave Lake, Peace River, and Wetaskiwin-Camrose.

The potential for clashes over energy infrastructure, environmental considerations, revenue sharing, and the constitutionally mandated duty to consult means future Alberta governments need to respond to Indigenous people.

There are those who believe that the election of the NDP was an accident and that Alberta is really an ideologically conservative province going back to the Social Credit days.

But is that true?

Politics in the new Alberta

The concluding chapter by Anthony Sayers and David Stewart — using post-election survey data from 2008, 2012, and 2015 — shows that notion is more myth than reality.

On most questions of political values, they write, ""stereotypes notwithstanding, voters in Alberta appear broadly supportive of a substantial role for the state with respect to government spending.""

This was also replicated by a spring 2018 survey for CBC by Janet Brown and John Santos, who co-wrote a chapter on polling in the book.

The chapter on the fiscal situation in Alberta, written by Ron Kneebone and Jennifer Zwicker, provides more evidence that Albertans are not particularly fiscally conservative. In reality, they say, we like high government spending and low taxes.

For decades, Albertans could get away with that because the gap between revenue and expenses was covered by rich oil and gas royalties. When those royalties decline, as they did in 2015, budget deficits occur.

Whoever wins the 2019 election will need to make some hard choices to address Alberta's fiscal situation.

The titular Orange Chinook refers to the winds of change that carried the NDP to victory in 2015. But chinooks can be temporary. We could see the government voted out of office in 2019.

However, as the sub-title indicates — Politics in the New Alberta — what we witnessed four years ago represents a much more durable shift than just a change of governing parties.

The Liberals' 2015 election platform hung on a pledge to invest heavily in critical infrastructure, roads and ...","OTTAWA — Finance Minister Bill Morneau sprinkled a little government funding on nearly everyone Tuesday, including key Liberal constituencies — young people, women, and seniors — who helped deliver the Grits their victory in 2015.

In his pre-election budget, Morneau announced $26.7 billion in new spending since the fall economic statement — nearly all of the $27.8 billion in additional revenues the government brought in since the November update and is forecast to bring in over the next four years.

For young people, many of whom voted for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in droves last time and are now about to, or just starting to, pay off their student loans, Morneau announced that their interest rates would be slashed and a six-month interest-free grace period adopted.

For students taking time off to deal with medical emergencies, parental responsibilities, or mental health issues, the government said it would also offer up to 18 months of interest-free, payment-free leave.

Watch: Morneau discusses his spending plan

The Liberals pledged to spend more money to help encourage students to enter the skills trades, while also instituting a pilot program that would allow students to gain more international work experience.

For millennials concerned they'll be shut out of the housing market, the Liberals proposed the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporations help with down payments — a type of interest-free loan payable when the home is sold. They also announced measures that allow first-time home buyers who have saved in their RRSP to use $35,000, up from the current $25,000 towards their down payment.

The Liberals' gendered budgeting lens was noticeable in a new measure that allows couples who split to use the first-time home buyers plan towards a second dwelling, after the collapse of their relationship. Granting student researchers paid parental leave is another measure aimed at women voters.

Seniors, who public opinion polling suggests voted for the Liberals in greater numbers in 2015, received $1.86 billion — most of it directed at low-income seniors through a program that would allow them to keep more of the money they earn in part-time jobs without seeing their Guaranteed Income Supplement clawed back.

The Liberals also pledged $100 million over five years for seniors programs and promised to begin payments to Canada Pension Plan contributors automatically at age 70 to ensure that no one misses out on money owed to them.

For Canadian pensioners, such as those at Sears or Nortel, who saw their companies go bankrupt and their benefits vanish, the government offered to make tweaks to the law — giving courts a greater ability to review executive compensation and to clarify in federal law that if a pension plan is terminated its participants must still receive the same benefits as when it existed. The measures, however, are a far cry from what the New Democrats champion.

Another NDP priority that was ignored in the budget is the party's call for a universal pharmacare program.

The Liberals announced baby steps. A new Canadian Drug Agency would attempt to buy in bulk and lower drug prices, all the while setting up a national formulary. By 2022, an annual $500-million strategy would see the federal government assist with buying expensive drugs for rare diseases.

Mostafa Askari, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said he thinks the government has given itself some room to make a pharmacare announcement this summer.

""I assume that is the case. Whether they have the fiscal room or not, that is a different issue,"" he said. ""It doesn't look like there is a lot of fiscal room if they want to stay in their current deficit track.""

Some proposals are building blocks

Some of the Liberals' flagship budget proposals, such as the new Canada Training Benefit, also seem designed as building blocks towards a larger program.

The Canada Training Benefit offers Canadians aged 25 to 64 an annual $250-a-year credit, to a lifetime limit of $5,000, to put towards half the cost of taking a course. The program, which is planned to begin in late 2020, would guarantee workers the right to take time off to train with the knowledge that their job would be secure. Employees would also be allowed to collect employment insurance for up to four weeks that can be used over four years to help pay for everyday necessities while away from work.

""This is the first time in the history of our country where Canadians actually have training now as a right,"" Hassan Yussuff, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress, told HuffPost Canada. People won't have to wait until they lose their jobs to access training, he said. ""I think this will fundamentally change the psychology of how people view training and, more importantly, hopefully, take advantage of it.""

The budget is peppered with hundreds of millions of dollars of new money for veterans and their families, the arts, Canada's military, international development assistance in the Middle East, the fight against opioid addiction and other health measures, as well as research and development and another $554 million more to fix Phoenix, the federal government's problem-plagued payment system for public servants.

However, the Liberals want Canadians to know about a few more programs they plan to pitch at people's front doors.

Liberals make pledge on high-speed internet

The first is a pledge to bring high-speed internet to every part of the country by 2030. The Liberals have talked about this; they've already invested in bringing high-speed internet to rural areas; and now they say they'll do it, in three electoral mandates.

The second, to make good on their promise that Canada will be selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2040, the Grits are ponying up $300 million over three years to give Canadians who purchase an electric battery or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle a $5,000 rebate on purchases under $45,000. The Liberals also plan to invest $130 million over five years to deploy recharging and refuelling stations across the country — in urban and remote locations — so Canadians aren't stranded when they use their green cars.

Two other big ticket items reflect government priorities, electoral considerations, and a rare admission that the original implementation suffered from insufficient pick-up, or, in the case of measures for Indigenous, Métis and Inuit Canadians, insufficient money.

""What we've seen is we've not been able to get as many projects done in some places, places like Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, as we'd like,"" Morneau said, in explaining a one-time $2.2 billion top-up to municipalities to ensure that ""more [infrastructure] projects get done across our country.""

The Liberals' 2015 election platform hung on a pledge to invest heavily in critical infrastructure, roads and water treatment plants, for example; green infrastructure, such as expanded transit; and social infrastructure, such a daycare spaces and social housing.

Watch: Former budget watchdog Kevin Page weighs in on spending plan

Approximately one-fifth of the total budget, $4.7 billion, is new program spending for Indigenous, Inuit and Métis. It includes, for example, $739 million over five years, increasing to $185 million annually after that, to address repairs to vulnerable water systems, operator training and for other programs to ensure First Nations communities can have safe drinking water. The Liberals have spent $2 billion since 2015, but with the new money say they are on track to eliminate all water advisories by March 2021.

The Liberals are also pledging $1.2 billion over three years to implement ""Jordan's Principle"" to ensure First Nations children can access health, social and educational services they need, when they need them.

When asked if the Liberals' budget focus on reconciliation had anything to do with the backlash from Indigenous communities after one of their leaders, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general, voiced concerns about Trudeau's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, the finance minister said no.

The Liberals have already spent $11 billion focused on Indigenous peoples and with this budget would be spending $17 billion by 2021, Morneau said.

""It's not a personality driven thing. It's driven by the fact we know that in this country we need to get this right. We've got a lot of work to do, and we're going to stay on it,"" he said.

Sean Kilpatrick/CP Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau speak as they walk to the House of Commons in Ottawa, Tuesday March 19, 2019.

One promise that is out the window — and has been since the Trudeau Liberals' first budget in 2016 — is the balancing of the books by the time the next election rolls around. The budget plans for a $19.8 billion deficit next year, which is forecast to fall to $9.8 billion by 2023-2024. The Liberals have planned for an annual $3 billion contingency cushion.

Morneau sidestepped questions about why the Liberals had made that pledge if they didn't intend to live by it.

""We believe that making investments in the middle class, it's the way to go,"" he told reporters.

The Liberals' Canada Child Benefit, for example, which costs more than $20 billion annually, has helped lift 278,000 children out of poverty, according to Statistics Canada figures.

Spending, or, as Morneau prefers to call it, investing, versus cutting is the wedge the Liberals are hoping to create against their Conservative counterparts.

""We're going to continue with the approach of investing in middle class Canadians,"" Morneau pledged Tuesday. ""We're not going to take the proposed approach of the Conservatives, the idea that cuts will lead to a better situation.""

Tories call budget an 'expensive coverup'

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and his finance critic, Pierre Poilievre, did not offer a substantive criticism of the Liberals budget Tuesday. Instead, the party accused Trudeau of engaging in an ""expensive coverup"" by using the budget announcement to distract from Liberal attempts to block Wilson-Raybould from testifying again at the justice committee.

The former attorney general testified at a Commons hearing last month that individuals in the Prime Minister's Office and in Morneau's office had tried to put pressure on her and her staff to direct the public prosecution service to offer a plea deal to SNC-Lavalin. The company faces fraud and corruption charges related to dealings in Libya.

Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, have denied any wrongdoing. Butts resigned in February, citing the need to defend his reputation. Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council Office, announced this week that he also plans to resign.

Last month, Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet days after her allegations emerged in the media.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada’s 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau’s embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government’s chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau’s Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday’s budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

“It’s just too broad,” said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. “They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.”

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was “a political rather than an economic decision,” he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied “that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.”

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau’s resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould’s statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals’ best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau’s budget presentation for an hour.

The Freedom Conservative Party, which is less than a year old, will put forward ""30-odd"" candidates for the provincial election, slated for April 16, he said.

Alberta's rights to self-govern are top of mind, Fildebrandt said, alluding to Quebec's separation movement.

Freedom Conservatives would, he said, offer voters the chance to decide ""if they want to continue the relationship with Ottawa,"" should the federal government not ""accept reasonable demands for equality for Alberta within Canada.""

""We want to be treated the same as… Quebec, to have control of our own immigration, our own tax collection, our own police force, our own pension and EI — and the complete end of equalization,"" Fildebrandt said.

The provincial election was announced Monday, and the other main contenders — the NDP, United Conservative Party, Alberta Party and Alberta Liberals — all held events to discuss their messages for the race.

'Not running paper candidates'

The Freedom Conservatives were missing from the first day of announcements. Instead, the party has an event scheduled for Thursday in Calgary to discuss platform points.

""We're not running paper candidates everywhere just to have a number of candidates,"" Fildebrandt said Wednesday. ""We want to have people running where we believe they can actually win.""

The party has strategically placed candidates in ridings where it believes the NDP are less likely to win a seat, he said.

Candidates will promise to answer to their constituents, he said, and not ""other politicians,"" as he accused UCP candidates of doing.

Fildebrandt will be trying to keep his seat in Strathmore-Brooks, saying his voting record showed he was ""the most right-leaning MLA in the province.""

Fildebrandt first won the seat in 2015 as a member of the now-defunct Wildrose Party. The party merged with the Progressive Conservatives to form the United Conservative Party, and he stayed in that caucus until 2017. He then left to sit as an independent.

A year ago, he was told he wasn't welcome to rejoin the UCP, and then formed the Freedom Conservative Party in July 2018.",Freedom Conservative Party promises about 30 candidates for Alberta election,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/deerek-fildebrandt-freedom-conservative-party-alberta-election-1.5065158

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 percent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 percent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

SCANDAL BREWING

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jason Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”","Ahead of Alberta vote, Canada's oil industry roots for the opposition",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R12T0-OCATP

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.

Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.

The Conservatives jeered. They pounded their desks and they chanted ""let her speak"" in reference to their demand that former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould re-appear before the justice committee to discuss why she resigned.

Undeterred, the finance minister gamely plowed on, incapable of being heard on radio and television broadcasts, or even by his own mates on the government benches.

So let's recap here.

Morneau's fourth budget is not only the last instalment of the Liberals' relentless pursuit of middle-class voters before the October election, it was a road map showing exactly which voters the party needs for another election win.

Millennials. Seniors. Blue-collar workers are all targeted for new spending, whether it's help buying a first home, enhancements to the Canada Pension Plan or money for training. Mix in the Canada Child Benefit from Morneau's first budget and from cradle to the grave, this government is putting more money in Canadians' pockets.

As usual, Morneau didn't call it spending. He never has.





Throughout his news conference in the budget lockup, the finance minister referred to investments, the need to continue to invest in Canadians even if it meant blowing by the campaign promise four years ago to balance the books by now.

""The most important promise we made to Canadians was to invest in their future,"" Morneau replied when asked why the government was choosing to run deficits into the foreseeable future.





""I hope Canadians will look at what we've done since the beginning, to make investments in me and my family,"" he said to another question about what Canadians should take from this budget.

""I think Canadians will look at us and know we delivered on our promise of more success, for more middle-class Canadians than ever before.""

Anxiety despite job growth

Underlying everything Morneau said, and every new measure he put in the budget, is a gnawing fear that Canadians may not feel any better off than they did four years ago in ending a decade of Conservative governments.

Morneau talked about that sense of anxiety even as he rang off the strong job growth numbers, how 54 per cent of those new jobs went to women. He mentioned it as he spoke about the biggest wage jump in a decade last year, and that Canada continues to lead the other G7 countries in economic growth.

Watch as Conservative MPs jeer Morneau:

""If you are a young person still struggling to find meaningful work, a low unemployment rate probably doesn't mean that much,"" he said in the speech that nobody heard.

""Good GDP numbers don't mean a lot when the job you need to feed your family is on the line.""

New Democrats called the budget a wasted opportunity. Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said Canadians can't wait for the measures outline in the budget that are spread out over five years, or won't kick in until after the election.

An unusually eventful budget day

He said the NDP would bring in a national pharmacare plan now to ensure no one goes without the medications they need. The NDP would spend now to build more affordable housing, not sometime down the road.

""This government doesn't have anything in this budget to build new affordable housing, nothing in this budget to address co-operative housing, or non market housing, instead they are offering people to use their RRSPs to buy their home,"" he told reporters.

""How many millenials are able to use, to have enough in their RRSP to buy a home? It shows how disconnected Mr. Trudeau is with respect to what Canadians are going through.""





The Conservatives hammered at the failure to present a plan to return to budget balance, but only as an afterthought.

Party Leader Andrew Scheer seemed far more interested in portraying the budget as a blatant attempt to deflect attention away from the role Justin Trudeau and his office played in trying to stop the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on fraud and corruption charges.





""Mr. Trudeau's plan is obvious. Massive deficits to distract Canadians from his corruption before the election. Massive tax hikes to pay for them after the election,"" he said.

As in something for everyone. Maybe. But the chickens in these pots are awfully modest. It might be more accurate to say an egg in every pot.

The Liberal government's budget, its last kick at the can before this fall's election, is certainly as much a political document as a financial one. And before anyone gets all self-righteous about ""buying votes,"" let's at least be honest: Every single incumbent government does the same thing to optimize its chances of re-election. The Trudeau Liberals are no different.

But while the investments may be modest, they are indeed plentiful.

Deficits continue. The Liberals are unapologetic, proudly so. They point to their economic track record, and the numbers support that. Most economists agree with Finance Minister Bill Morneau's mantra that the debt-to-GDP ratio matters more than deficits. But like many Canadians, we would be much more comfortable with a financial plan that included a path to balanced budgets.

There's help for first-time homebuyers. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. will have $1.25 billion to help eligible buyers lower their mortgage costs. You still need your down payment — typically five per cent of the total price — but if you apply for an insured mortgage, you could receive an incentive of up to 10 per cent. And if you're fortunate enough to have an RRSP, you can borrow against it.

There's something for low-income seniors. They'll be able to keep more of the money they earn before their Guaranteed Income Supplement is clawed back. And pension-protection language will be toughened to make it harder for bankrupt companies to slash retiree pensions and benefits. (It's worth noting that much more work remains on that file.)

A new Canada Training Credit will encourage workers 25 to 64 to put away up to $250 annually to a maximum of $5,000, to be used for deferring training costs, and a new employment insurance measure will subsidize workers who take leave for training purposes.

The budget's biggest investment is $1.4 billion for social services for Indigenous children. An additional $740 million will continue efforts to bring clean water to all communities and $333 million will support Indigenous languages.

Significantly, there's $2 billion to go directly to municipalities to speed up the rollout of infrastructure investments. This is in response to provincial governments, like Ontario's, that have refused to partner with Ottawa. So now the feds are going directly to municipalities — which makes perfect sense, since they are most efficient and effective at infrastructure upgrading. It also seems to signal a new degree of respect for local governments, which is overdue and welcome.",Editorial: Budget a prelude to a pharmacare election campaign in Canada,Waterloo Region Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/9232272-editorial-budget-a-prelude-to-a-pharmacare-election-campaign-in-canada/

Andrew Scheer might just be having a smooth ride in the forthcoming elections.","The governing federal liberals are likely to lose their party status, the same way Kathleen Wynne’s Ontario Liberals, lost theirs, says Andre Marin, writing for the Toronto Sun. The only way to avoid this, writes the columnist, is for Justin Trudeau to“check his ego at the door.” In addition to dropping his ego, Trudeau was also advised to own up and concede that he and his allies messed up and won’t interfere with criminal prosecutions again.

Trudeau ego was likened to that of Wynne who lost all touch with the people and believed she could beat all odds all by herself until Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives came along with a simple three-word slogan: “For the People.” And took the leadership seat away from her.

It took Wynne about a decade to lose the Ontario seat, but it’s taking Trudeau just about three years, and worse still he seems to be in a free-fall just seven months before the elections. At present, a lot of Canadians are disappointed with Trudeau’s recent actions and the actions of his party allies such as PCO head Michael Wernick, especially how they have handled the entire SNC Lavalin scandal, now popularly called LavScam.

""The past few weeks have been an abysmal, slow-motion train wreck in issues management for the Trudeau Government,"" Ottawa-based political analyst YaroslavBaransaid, speaking with CNN.

When he was elected, Trudeau had promised to bring Canada back, but his actions these past few weeks could only be taking Canada backwards, right now Canada is under investigations by The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. They are reviewing the country’s compliance with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. “That’s the kind of review you’d expect of developing countries rife with corruption.” Says Marin. “Interestingly, Trudeau and his bunch of gofers justified harassing Wilson-Raybould into a deferred prosecution agreement by claiming they could save 9,000 jobs. But a country is under an OECD bribery investigation sends bad vibes to international businesses who might want to invest in Canada. Brilliant.”

Worse still, in the face of all this, Trudeau remains unrepentant. He is neither contrite nor apologetic and blames the former attorney general, Wilson-Raybould for not coming to him with her protests. Even after she had given evidence, that she did meet him with her objections.

Recently, Trudeau seems to be busy with any other thing but the issue at hand. Last week, on Wednesday 13th of March when the Justice Committee was to hold an emergency meeting to discuss bringing back Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance. Trudeau’s Liberals used their majority to adjourn the committee’s work to budget day, it is apparent, that they hope that the budget’s news would swallow upLavscam. Trudeau has also been vacationing, going from North Captiva Island to Florida while the image of its government gets even more tainted.

This begs questions about the Prime Minister’s commitment to the core values that got him that federal seat in the first place.If Trudeau keeps this up, Conservative Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer might just be having a smooth ride in the forthcoming elections.","Failure Looms: Trudeau’s Lav-Scam Snowballs, as Federal Elections Approach",Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13605-failure-looms-trudeaus-lav-scam-snowballs-as-federal-elections-approach.html

A year after the so-called mortgage stress test came into effect, the mortgage underwriting guidelines are being targeted by Conservative politicians ahead of a provincial and general election.

Alberta United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, a speaker at the Calgary Real Estate Board on Jan. 30, said the mortgage stress test was punitive to prospective Alberta homeowners and out of touch with housing markets in the province.

READ MORE: Could you pass the mortgage stress test? Here’s how to find out

“One of the reasons why homes are less affordable in Alberta today is because of unfair rules imposed by Ottawa to deal with the overheated real estate markets in Toronto and Vancouver,” Kenney said.

“The so-called ‘stress test’ imposed by the CMHC (Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation) has put tens of thousands of Albertans out of reach of home ownership, diminishing the value of the homes they can buy, to deal with the real estate market in Toronto and Vancouver.”

Kenney went on to say that the mortgage stress test came into effect in January 2018, in the middle of Alberta’s post-oil price shock-fueled recession.

“We did not have the risk of overheating nationally. They did have the risk of overheating in Toronto and Vancouver. They took out a bazooka rather than a fly swatter to take care of the problem.”

READ MORE: Jason Kenney wants Alberta exemption on housing stress test

Calgary-Shepard Conservative MP Tom Kmiec also took aim at the stress test in a House of Commons debate on affordable housing on Jan. 31, calling the CMHC regulations “a one-size-fits-all tool that punishes Canadians from coast to coast to coast, regardless of the prices in their local markets.”

What’s the allegation?

Kenney and Kmiec purport that the mortgage stress test is unfair to Albertans and punishes them for overheating housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. They also say the stress test has put “tens of thousands of Albertans out of reach of home ownership.”

They call for the mortgage stress test to be scrapped in Alberta.

What are the facts?

The stress test is applicable to all prospective home buyers with a less-than-20 per cent down payment — the buyers who require mortgage insurance offered by CMHC and two private insurers.

Those home buyers are evaluated on whether they could pay their mortgage if interest rates went up by two per cent above their current rate. The interest rate rise also serves as a proxy to other financial stresses a household might face, like a job loss or a reduction in income.

The stress test was passed along to Canada’s federally-regulated financial institutions in guideline B-20, “Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures,” from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). It is the latest in a series of mechanisms designed to stabilize house prices across Canada.

“The federal government and CMHC were looking at things like price-to-income ratios and price-to-rent ratios and noted that, globally, Canada is at the top end of those ratios,” said David Dale-Johnson, the Stan Melton Chair in Real Estate at the University of Alberta School of Business.

“In other words, housing prices here are pretty high relative to most other places around the world. Their concern is that Canadians are overextended with respect to their purchases of housing.”

What do the experts say?

While the CMHC’s mission stated on its website is “to make housing affordable for everyone in Canada,” housing prices were running away from being affordable in cities other than Toronto and Vancouver, with areas like Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe, Victoria and the greater Lower Mainland who were getting most of that overheating in 2017.

The size of the Toronto and Vancouver markets in proportion to the national housing market gave good reason for regulatory intervention, especially in the event houses in the 416 and 604 area codes experience a downturn.

“When you have Toronto and Vancouver representing more than half of home resales across Canada, they do register at the national level,” Dale-Johnson said. “You have to pay attention to what’s going on and, if it’s overheating, the risk of the market turning down with the potential of a brutal decline that could disrupt the market with a significant price decline — just for the sake of the stability of the market — it did make sense.”

“If we go back a couple of years prior to the oil price shock, there were some worries in Edmonton and Calgary,” Dale-Johnson added.

Before the stress test, insured mortgage eligibility requirements changed to include an increase in the minimum credit score, reducing the amortization period to 25 years from 30, limiting the home price tag mortgage insurance would cover, among others.

Vancouver introduced a one per cent empty homes tax in November 2016 and the Ontario government announced its Fair Housing Plan in April 2017, which included a foreign buyers tax and expanded rent controls.

In addition to stabilizing housing prices, the B-20 guideline is designed to reduce the number of Canadians with high mortgage debts.

“They are particularly focused on reducing the share of borrowers who are highly-indebted, so those borrowers who are seeking high loan-to-value mortgages,” CMHC senior analyst James Cuddy said.

“And there’s evidence to show that the share of mortgages going toward highly-indebted individuals is declining in Calgary and Edmonton.”

This probably a good thing, according to RBC senior economist Robert Hogue.

“Alberta households are the most indebted in Canada,” Hogue told Global News.

“Household debt has been identified by the Bank of Canada and many of us in the private sector as a key vulnerability to the health of the economy.

“High household debt may exacerbate the outcome” of the next downturn in the economy, Hogue said, adding the prudent course of action is to keep focusing on debt.

How indebted are Albertans?

Nationwide, Canadians have a debt-to-income ratio of 179 per cent to start 2019. Put another way, on average, for every dollar a Canadian earns, she or he owes $1.79. That’s the highest it’s been since records began in 1990.

According to an RBC economics report published in April 2018, Albertans’ total debts rose from $164,000 per household in 2010 to $192,000 in 2016, the highest of the 10 provinces. As of 2016, RBC says Alberta’s households spend 15.2 per cent of their disposable income servicing debt.

On Wednesday, Statistics Canada said Canadian households are spending even more to service their debt.

“Debt-to-income levels remain relatively high in both markets (Calgary and Edmonton). Part of the reason OSFI revised B-20 was to address this issue,” Cuddy added.

Moody’s, the international credit service, released a report Thursday saying “Canadian consumers are increasingly vulnerable to an adverse economic scenario despite stabilized household debt and low unemployment.”

What else do I need to know?

If a buyer has to qualify for a mortgage at a higher rate, does that affect how much house they can buy? Put simply, yes.

“The stress test had the biggest impact on the budget of buyers,” Hogue said.

“They have to have 20 per cent more income than they used to have or they would be buying a house that’s 20 per cent cheaper than they would have liked to have bought,” Dale-Johnson said.

In addition to lowering the budget Canadians are working with when buying a home, Mortgage Professionals Canada — a mortgage industry association — estimates a July 2018 report, that “about 100,000 Canadians have actually been prevented from buying a home.”

Credit report and credit score company Equifax recently said that consumer delinquency rates are on the rise in Canada.

Equifax reports that non-mortgage debt amounts are trending up in Alberta, with delinquencies increasing in Calgary but decreasing in Edmonton.

“Delinquency rates have much more to do with the state of the economy rather than interest rates or property values or size of mortgage,” Hogue said. “Delinquency rates, especially mortgage delinquency rates, correlates very highly with the unemployment rate.

“So what you’re witnessing in Alberta is the weakening in the provincial economy that is taking a toll on a number of borrowers that are facing some difficult situations,” the RBC senior economist added. “Rising interest rates possibly exacerbate the matter.”

According to the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, more Albertans and Canadians are declaring bankruptcy — Alberta alone saw a 9.9 per cent increase in the 2018 calendar year.

Does the stress test unfairly punish Albertans?

For Hogue, one of the benefits of the stress test is a reduced debt load for Albertans who are already in a tough economy.

While reducing or eliminating the stress test could help increase house-buying budgets in the short term, market economic basics would kick in and increase demand and prices.

“While policymakers making changes might be well-intended, at the end of the day you’re not solving the basic issue of housing affordability,” Hogue said.

Hogue argued in a Feb. 28 report that the solution to getting more people into buying houses is to increase the supply of houses affordable to those entering the market.

According to ATB Financial, a record number of completed homes remain vacant and unpurchased in Edmonton, with Calgary reaching record numbers, as well. The provincial financial institution did not include a breakdown of the prices of those homes.

For the University of Alberta housing economist, the downturn in oil prices in 2015 took a lot of momentum out of the province’s housing market.

“If you look at Alberta separate from the rest of the country, I’d be inclined to think that you would not have needed a stress test because the oil price shock has taken care of any problem that might have arisen,” Dale-Johnson said.

READ MORE: Nearly 50% of mortgages in Alberta are up for renewal in 2018

The stress test isn’t the only reason it’s been difficult for Albertans to buy homes, according to Cuddy.

“The caveat is that it’s very difficult to disentangle the individual effects when looking at an environment in Calgary and Edmonton where we have some real challenges in the economy and higher interest rates as well,” Cuddy said. “Understanding the magnitude of the stress tests in terms of impact is difficult to assess.”

“Anywhere in Canada it’s hard to put together a down payment and finally get into home ownership,” Hogue said. “The bar is the highest it’s ever been in the country.

“At the same time, you don’t want to put young families, young households, at risk down the road of an even worse outcome.

“Knowing that Alberta households are the most indebted in Canada, that’s something to keep in mind when criticizing the type of policy that was really designed to address issues elsewhere but they are applicable to situations in Alberta.”

“If you want to help millennials or first time home buyers, focus on the economy,” Hogue said.

What can a premier do?

Given that the OSFI and CMHC are an independent federal agency and Crown corporation, respectively, premiers of any province are unable to do away with the mortgage stress test. The best they can hope for is to lobby and convince the finance minister and the executives of the OSFI and CMHC to change the mortgage stress test.

Whether or not they should is a question of caution.

Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau — whose purview includes the OSFI and CMHC — is set to table the pre-election budget on March 19, where he could relax mortgage eligibility requirements, lengthen the amortization of mortgages (the amount of time to pay a mortgage off, reducing monthly mortgage payments) or increase the amount a home buyer can withdraw from an RRSP for a house purchase.",Alberta Election Fact Check: Time to end the mortgage stress test?,SooToday,https://www.sootoday.com/global-news/alberta-election-fact-check-time-to-end-the-mortgage-stress-test-1324714

Instead, Morneau has focused on lowering the net debt-to-GDP ratio — a measure of how burdensome the ...","OTTAWA — The final budget of the Trudeau government's mandate will scatter billions in fresh spending — on everything from pharmacare to retraining workers to first-time home buyers — as the Liberals commit to an electoral fight that pits their deficit-spending vision versus the Conservatives' balanced-books approach.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau's budget Tuesday resembled Liberal economic plans that preceded it: the government will exhaust a big windfall, run near-term deficits of about $20 billion and offer no timeline to return to balance.

The document tabled in the Commons showed that a stronger economy last year will put an extra $27.8 billion into the federal treasury over the next six years, compared to government predictions in its November economic update.

With seven months to go before the election, Morneau's plan will spread around $22.8 billion of that additional cash. The government also said it's booked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Out of all this new spending, most of it will be aimed at Canadians' pocketbooks.

Funding for some of Tuesday's commitments will only start kicking in after October's election, giving voters the chance to weigh in on the budget's contents at the ballot box.

The Liberals' plan places them in stark contrast with the Opposition Conservatives, who have called on the government to rein in spending.

""The opposition would like to see us make cuts very rapidly — their idea is balance the budget at any cost,"" Morneau told a news conference Tuesday after being asked about his deficits.

""Well, if we had taken that approach in 2015 we would not be where we are today with a better outcome for middle-class Canadians. We'd be in a more difficult spot.""

The measures in Morneau's fiscal blueprint cover a lot of territory, with a clear focus on individuals — particularly younger adults — as opposed to businesses. The plan includes:

— $4.6 billion over five years to help more Canadians afford and access skills training to keep up with the rapidly evolving workforce

— $4.5 billion over five years to improve living conditions for Indigenous Peoples

— $1.8 billion over four years to enhance the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors

— $885 million over five years to make homes more affordable for first-time buyers

— $500 million per year, starting in 2022-23, to help cover the cost of drugs for rare diseases.

The government will make several large, one-time investments for 2018-19, including $2.2 billion worth of new infrastructure funding and $1 billion towards improving energy efficiency.

The budget also pledges up to $3.9 billion for supply-managed dairy, egg and poultry farmers affected by recent trade deals with the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

Even with these investments, Ottawa's fiscal track promises to be a key issue on the campaign trail.

The annual deficit projections in Tuesday's budget — which reach as high as $19.8 billion — are less than one percentage point of Canada's gross domestic product, a modest level when compared internationally.

Still, the Liberals will be forced to explain themselves repeatedly until election day.

They came to power in 2015 on a platform that vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019.

After the 2015 election, the Trudeau government abandoned the promise, arguing more investments were needed to lift Canada's long-term economic growth. Instead, Morneau has focused on lowering the net debt-to-GDP ratio — a measure of how burdensome the national debt is — each year even as the actual debt has increased.

The Conservatives have attacked the Liberals for breaking their deficit promise and have demanded Morneau map out a return to balanced books. They've accused the government of borrowing today on the backs of future generations.

Morneau introduced his blueprint Tuesday just before 4 p.m. ET, but his customary budget speech to the House of Commons was delayed an hour by a series of procedural manoeuvres by the Conservatives.

When Morneau finally started speaking, Tory MPs drowned out most of his address by stomping and shouting.

The Tories were protesting the Liberal-dominated justice committee's decision earlier Tuesday to pull the plug on its probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's and his senior officials have faced allegations of judicial interference.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

By Julie Gordon

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, seeking to move past a political crisis threatening its re-election, lavished new spending on middle-class voters in its budget on Tuesday, but the measures may be spread too thin to move the needle before October's vote.

The budget was aimed at boosting consumer spending at a time when the economy is slowing, while shifting the narrative away from a scandal involving a major engineering and construction company that has shaken the ruling Liberal Party government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top government officials leaned on his former justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

The issue has dragged the party down in opinion polls, which indicate it is at risk of losing power to the official opposition Conservatives in October's federal election.

The Liberals looked to counter that narrative with a budget that sprinkled benefits widely, helping everyone from millennials to retirees.

But with no single blockbuster pledge and with opposition antics distracting from the Liberals' message, Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos said the budget was unlikely to put Trudeau's party back ahead.

""At best, they can hope to stop the political bleeding,"" he said. The Liberals fell to 32.6 percent support in the latest Nanos Research poll, behind the Conservatives at 35.5 percent.

Opposition lawmakers delayed Finance Minister Bill Morneau from presenting the budget for an hour and then the Conservatives drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers. They later walked out in protest at what party leader Andrew Scheer said was Trudeau's attempt to bury the SNC-Lavalin scandal, calling it a ""corruption cover-up.""

""This budget has no legitimacy and we could not legitimize it by remaining in the chamber,"" Scheer told reporters.

The budget outlined C$21 billion ($15.8 billion) in spending over five years on new measures, including help to get first-time buyers into housing, a new skills training benefit, new perks for retirees and students, and the creation of a federal agency to cut the cost of prescription medications.

""The challenge I think with this budget is that there are so many boxes they tried to tick - everybody will get a little bit, but nobody will get enough,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.

""To me, you get more bang for your buck if you have a focused approach,"" he added.

HELP FOR HOMEBUYERS

With many Canadians struggling to buy homes amid rising interest rates and stricter mortgage rules, the budget promised measures to help millennials and others boost their purchasing power without taking on too much debt.

It introduced a program to let some first-time buyers finance a portion of their home purchases through a shared equity mortgage with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government housing agency.

Under the plan, the CMHC would provide 10 percent equity on a new home or 5 percent on a resale home. It would then share in any upside benefit or downside risk, and the government said the move would incentivize the construction of new housing supply.

The move, along with other housing incentives, could give Canada's housing market a much-needed shot in the arm, reviving construction and bolstering homeowner sentiment, although economists warned the overall impact may be marginal.

""It is a potential concession that they went a step too far in dampening the housing market,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

BUSINESSES LEFT OUT

But there was little in the budget for corporate Canada, despite repeated calls from business groups for wide-ranging tax changes or cuts to boost competitiveness.

In his November budget update, Morneau unveiled a plan to allow businesses to write off additional capital investments to help them compete globally, but he stopped short of slashing taxes, saying it would cost tens of billions.

The budget on Tuesday did include a new training benefit, which will give workers money toward tuition and paid time off work to pursue new skills.

The measure could help employers that say they are struggling to fill jobs requiring specialized skills, notably in the technology and healthcare fields.

In the run-up to Canada’s October ...,"This week’s federal budget included millions of dollars to beef up Canada’s detection and advisory capacity against nation-state and criminal attacks on critical infrastructure and democratic processes.

On Wednesday government officials, academics and private sector experts got a view into the future of cyber warfare at the 5th Security and Defence Symposium between Canada and the European Union in Ottawa.

That future, one panelist said in an interview, can be seen in the attacks — usually attributed to Russia or Russian-supported groups — on Ukraine in the past three years. They’re a toxic mixture of military and cyber incidents dubbed hybrid attacks.

Josef Schroefl, deputy director of the Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (also known as the the Hybrid CoE), called Ukraine “the whole symphony, hybrid orchestration: Disinformation campaigns, cyber attacks and kinetic [military] attacks.”

A brief roundup of the incidents includes successive power failures in back-to-back Decembers and the recent seizure by Russia of three Ukrainian navy ships in the strait between Russia and the Ukrainian region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

“What you see in Ukraine frightens me,” Schroef said. “Ukraine is something like a test lab for maybe something bigger. We don’t know.”

The half-day symposium is one of a number of ways Western countries are working together to exchange best practices for facing defence challenges, including nation-state backed cyber attacks. For example, Canada and the centre held a three-day table-top exercise in January to test their response skills, Schroefl said.

Last fall Canada joined the Hybrid CoE. Other members include Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S.

The organization defines hybrid threats as

Co-ordinated and synchronized action, that deliberately targets democratic states’ and institutions systemic vulnerabilities, through a wide range of means (political, economic, military, civil, and information);

Activities exploit the thresholds of detection and attribution as well as the border between war and peace;

The aim is to influence different forms of decision making at the local (regional), state, or institutional level to favour and/or gain the agent’s strategic goals while undermining and/or hurting the target.

Joining the group followed commitments made by Canada and other G7 countries at their annual meeting last year in Charlevoix, Que., to defend democracy from online foreign threats. Among the promises each country made was to set up a cyber Rapid Response Mechanism. This network will strengthen co-operation. between countries to identify and respond to diverse and evolving threats. Canada is the network co-ordinator, so the budget proposes giving the Global Affairs department $2.1 million over three years to help its work.

It parallels the Cyber Readiness Response Teams and Mutual Assistance in Cyber Security agreement that some European countries set up in 2016 under the EU’s Permanent Structure Co-operation (PESCO) on security and defence. Eight nations have or are setting up teams under the pact, which essentially established a collective cyber defence. To facilitate the teams one PESCO project is the creation of a cyber incident response information sharing platform.

Twenty five of the EU’s 28 countries have joined PESCO, but most have not yet joined the cyber mutual assistance pact.

One panel at Wednesday’s symposium discussed how PESCO — designed to increase EU co-operation — can work with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military institution. Not all members of the EU are members of NATO.

The other panel dealt with how to confront hybrid attacks, and included Air Commodore John Maas, senior military advisor to the European External Action Service; Colleen Merchant, director general of Public Safety Canada’s national cyber security directorate, Schroefl, and Satyamoorthy Kabilan, vice-president of policy for the Ottawa-based Public Policy Forum.

In a pre-conference interview, Kabilan said one of the biggest problems in dealing with cyber attacks is attribution.

“It’s very difficult to say definitively who’s behind a specific attack,” he pointed out. “In many cases there’s a little speculation involved. If you look at the number of attacks where people speculate nation-states are involved, and you look at the number where there have been indictments or statements from nations saying ‘X was responsible for attack Y,’ there’s a huge difference.”

And while it’s clear under NATO’s agreement when countries can come to the aid of another under physical attack, the rules are less clear when it comes to a cyber attack. That’s even more true for the world as a whole.

“We have nothing equivalent to the Geneva Convention when it comes to hybrid and cyber warfare,” Kabilan said. “So the line in the sand when you cross and it means, ‘This is an act of war’ — there isn’t one when it comes to cyber. No one knows what it is, what it should be. This creates some really difficult problems — how do we defend ourselves?”

European countries have been worrying about this since 2007 when Estonia faced a series of cyber attacks against parliament, government departments, banks and the media amid a conflict over a grave marker with Russia. According to Wikipedia, that led to NATO creating a cyber defence centre of excellence in Estonia.

Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, NATO beefed up its forces in Baltic countries, with Canada leading the battle group in Latvia. According to the National Post, they have been the target of repeated disinformation as part of a campaign to discredit NATO forces.

The disinformation ranges from stories about Canadian troops being accommodated in luxury apartments at local taxpayers’ expense, to images that purport to show them littering indiscriminately or fixated on buying beer, Latvia’s defence minister told the National Post.

Around the same time, according to the Globe and Mail, Russian media targeted German NATO soldiers in Lithuania, when it fabricated a story accusing the officers of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.

On the other hand cyber attacks might get out of hand. That’s what some experts think happened in 2017 with the global spread of the NotPetya wiper malware. They believe it started as a Russia-backed attack on Ukraine by planting malware in a Ukranian accounting software package. But the malware spread around the world. Among the victims was the Maersk shipping company, which had to replace 4,000 new servers, 45,000 PCs, and 2,500 applications.

Disinformation — better known as fake news — can be an effective weapon, but it isn’t in the same league as compromising critical infrastructure and ‘jiggling the handles’ just to make people nervous. It does have the advantage, though, of being less messy than an invasion or a few warning shots across a border.

A prime example of how big a disinformation campaign can go is the huge alleged Russia-directed effort during the 2016 U.S. elections — which included hacking email of staff from the Hilary Clinton campaign, and creating phony social media accounts to spread disinformation. There were also hacking incidents leading up to the recent German and French national elections.

Disinformation is being confronted by governments encouraging social media platforms to crack down on suspicious content. In the run-up to Canada’s October federal election the government recently passed a law obliging platforms to create a registry showing who is paying for election-related ads. It also created a task force to prevent covert, clandestine, or criminal activities from influencing or interfering with the electoral process.

The thing is, as Schroefl points out, online war is relatively cheap (compared to a missile or a jet bomber). That’s why he believes large nations are unlikely to dominate cyber warfare: There’s lots of room for small countries.

It also makes it harder to get unanimity on norms of behaviour in cyberspace.

So how can hybrid threats be met? “The lessons from the last years are public-private partnerships, don’t forget critical infrastructure and civilian-military relations,” said Schroefl.

Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.","OTTAWA — A one-time $2.2-billion windfall in the federal budget to help Canadian cities improve roads, bridges, highways and water systems won't become an annual tradition, Finance Minister Bill Morneau warned Wednesday, even in the face of what he acknowledged were problems getting the original projects off the ground.

Tuesday's multibillion-dollar top-up will double the money cities receive through the federal gas-tax fund, which sends money directly to municipalities each year.

The spending blueprint says the Liberals have approved more than 33,000 projects worth about $19.9 billion in federal financing under new and existing infrastructure programs, but also acknowledges spending has been slower than anticipated, including ""some jurisdictions being slower to prioritize projects.""

Morneau called out four provinces on Tuesday in explaining the Liberals' decision to use the gas-tax fund to kickstart more projects, naming Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick — provinces with conservative-minded governments that don't always co-operate readily with the federal Liberals.

Topping up the fund was the appropriate response, Morneau said Wednesday at a post-budget event in Toronto.

""We haven't been able to do exactly what we expected and that was the reason for the municipal infrastructure top-up,"" he said.

""What you shouldn't do is take this as a conclusion on how we will go forward, but what it is, is an important way for us to move forward now in getting some projects that are stalled going.""

Federal infrastructure funding is regularly subject to delays because funds only flow once receipts are filed, which causes a lag between when work occurs and money is paid out.

An internal analysis of the Liberal program pointed to several issues to explain the pace of spending: too many low-value projects requiring the same detailed review as those much larger in size and delays in getting provincial and territorial project recommendations.

Elections in Ontario and New Brunswick last year paused provincial project approvals during the campaign. There are also delays in approvals when a new government is elected — as was the case in Ontario and New Brunswick — as new office holders learn their files and review government operations.

Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que., said the measures are a direct response to pleas from cities to modernize their relationship with Ottawa so they don't have to rely solely on the provinces.

Under the federal Liberal government's infrastructure program, federal spending will top $186 billion over the next decade.

How successful the plan has been to date is an area of contention between the Liberals and the parliamentary budget watchdog, who most recently questioned anew whether increases in federal spending have created the jobs promised by the government.

Other investments have, according to provinces, fallen short of what was required, particularly on rural broadband internet service. Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.

The Liberals created the bank in 2017 to take $35 billion in federal financing and use it to leverage three to four times that from the private sector to help pay for major highways, bridges, and water and electrical systems. To get private money involved, projects needed to produce revenue streams — tolls, for instance. Fees for internet service are already typical, but serving remote, sparsely populated areas with high-speed lines is a financial challenge.

On Tuesday, the Liberals added a new component to the Crown agency, earmarking $1 billion over 10 years for rural broadband, but mandating the bank find at least $2 billion more in private capital for the initiative. It was part of a plan to deliver up to $6 billion over a decade to connect everyone in the country to high-speed internet by 2030.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has promised the budget will contain help for workers in need of skills training, young people looking to buy their first homes, seniors worried about their own finances, and patients with high drug costs.

“It’s an election budget … There’s been a tendency to use these as important communications vehicles – almost platform-launching vehicles,” Kevin Page, Canada’s former parliamentary budget officer, said in reference to recent budgets from federal and multiple provincial governments.

The likelihood that the Liberals will use the budget to sell their own record raises a question: who deserves credit for Canada’s strong economic run?

Job-creation numbers have been solid and the unemployment rate has fallen close to a 40-year low. A recent Statistics Canada report said in 2017 fewer Canadians were living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade. The agency credited the drop to a mix of a stronger economy and the Liberals’ enhancement of child benefits.

Canada rode a long stretch of impressive economic growth until the final three months of 2018 before it abruptly decelerated – and nearly stalled – along with a drop in oil prices. Experts predict the economy will regain its momentum over the coming months.

But even with a surprisingly weak end to 2018, Ottawa’s financial situation is better than last November’s fall fiscal update projected.

Experts say the federal treasury pulled in more tax revenues than anticipated. Many fully expect the Liberals to dedicate the bulk of the extra money to new promises, as they’ve done with windfalls in past budgets and economic statements.

Over the last few years, the Liberals have spent billions more than they promised in their 2015 election platform.

[RANT] Trudeau’s deficits: Short-term gain, long-term pain

They vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019. Instead, they’ve posted shortfalls of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and have offered no timeline to balance the budget. In their November update, the Liberals projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.

Morneau has regularly argued that the Liberal plan is working.

“Our government has made smart and responsible investments in the middle class, and Canadians are seeing concrete results,” Morneau told the House of Commons last month as he announced the budget date.

Morneau has argued the bigger-ticket commitments, in areas such as child benefits and infrastructure, have been necessary to juice the economy for years to come. He’s also insisted the deficits remain small enough that they’re fiscally prudent.

Page expects the Liberals to take credit for the economic improvements and he thinks they deserve some recognition _ particularly for enhancing child benefits and an ambitious, expensive infrastructure plan, despite its slow start.

But he added Canada’s prospects have also been lifted by strong economic performances in the United States and the world as a whole.

Page said it’s difficult to know whether the Liberal deficits will actually raise Canada’s long-term growth or if they’ve mostly created a big, temporary bump in consumer spending, as the government has borrowed money and put it into Canadians pockets.

“You don’t have to be at balance. There’s nothing perfect about a zero (deficit) number in this environment,” said Page, who now heads the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy think-tank at the University of Ottawa. “Having said that, we are adding to the stock of debt and that creates potential instability down the road and we’ll have less room to manoeuvre – and future generations, definitely, are going to pay higher interest costs on the public debt.”

The Opposition Conservatives, some economists and leaders in corporate Canada have criticized the Liberal deficits, especially because they’ve come during good economic times that are traditionally thought to be when governments should pay debt off.

“My concern is, and I’ve said this to him … privately and publicly, it’s not that you’re spending, it’s where you’re spending,” Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said of his exchanges with Morneau. “You’re spending a lot on things that no one can really point to and can say (there’s a) direct line back to helping the economy.”

Hyder said he supported Morneau’s move last fall to use some fiscal space for new accelerated investment write-offs for businesses. He also applauds the Liberals’ commitment to invest in worker training and their earlier efforts on trade, immigration and child benefits.

But he insists there’s an urgent need for Canada to be more competitive on regulations and taxes if it hopes to avoid falling behind the rest of the world.","Liberal budget to applaud Canada’s economy, but who deserves credit?",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/economy/liberal-budget-to-applaud-canadas-economy-but-who-deserves-credit-182168/

Transcript:

James West: Charting Man Dan McDermott joins me now via Skype from Asheville, North Carolina, right, Dan?

Dan McDermott: That’s right, glad to be back!

James West: Yeah, it’s great to have you back. Dan, so today our theme is, you know, the outlook for cannabis stocks and the economy generally in the context of the 2020 elections, and you had some interesting hypotheses – theses, we’ll call them. Why don’t we start with that?

Dan McDermott: Sure. So it’s bigger-picture, you know, we’re looking 20 months out, and I’m told that in the US it’s a much bigger deal. We look a lot further ahead in the election than you do in Canada, and that’s probably because there’s billions of dollars doing their best to purchase the outcomes. But what we’re going to be looking for is, we clearly see that the stock market is a fan of Trump and Republicans. It’s been going up since he was elected, in a very big way.

So we can assume that if Trump is re-elected, the market is going to be, you know, continue to do well, continue to hold on. And that would be important for the MJ sector because, you know, I’m always talking about correlations to the S&P 500 and how big of an impact that does have on the sector as a whole.

But we can also look at the other side of things and say that if a Democrat were to win, that would be negative for the overall market in my opinion, and we can anticipate things are going to go down due to a number of reasons. You know, we have Democrats talking about reining in the biotech sector, reining in the big banks, reining in Citizens United, which allows Big Money to have influence on politics. So if that were to happen, we would anticipate the markets would go down.

But we can make the assumption that if a Democrat were to be elected, they are very likely to have a very pro-marijuana legalization platform as well. So we can assume that while the markets will be going down in a reaction to a win, we would see the MJ market start to thrive again, anticipating that we would get accelerated steps toward legalization. So it’s almost like the marijuana sector could be a hedge play to go bullish in, as the market pulls back if there were a Democrat elected.

Now, way too soon to look at polls or anything like that, but this is just broader picture, something to start wrapping our heads around as we get ready for 2020.

James West: Sure. So are you suggesting, then, that a Republican victory, while it will be good for a broader economy, would be less beneficial to the progress of cannabis de-prohibition in the US than would a Democrat win?

Dan McDermott: I would say so. I think it’s inevitable regardless; we’re just talking timelines, and I think a Democrat would probably be a faster timeline towards legalization, towards, you know, rescheduling, getting the banking sector involved, all of the key points that we need to see for the US MJ market to start to thrive. So it would be an accelerated version of what’s going to play out, if the Democrats were to pull out a victory.

James West: Sure. Do you think the scope and scale of the cannabis market in 2020 would be sufficient to offset the broader economic downturn that would be engendered by a Democratic victory, as they seek to bring debt and spending under control?

Dan McDermott: Not big picture, not as far as a whole market is concerned; but if we’re talking individuals, you know, my parents are of the age of entering retirement, and so I’m constantly wondering, you know, what are people that have retirement accounts going to be doing? And if we were to see a Democrat victory, it would be bad timing in the sense that, you know, their investments would probably be taking a hit while they’re already retired, while they’re relying on that money.

But if they make that hedge play and go into the MJ space, in my opinion, it will make the blow to their account a little bit less severe.

James West: Interesting. Okay, so one of the events in the cannabis space that I wanted to touch on is, we saw HEXO bought Newstrike. So that’s, HEXO was the larger company there, and Newstrike was the lesser company, but against normal traditions when that kind of thing happens, we saw that the acquiring company’s stock went up, as did the acquiree, which is contrary to the normal pattern of the acquiring company’s stock taking a hit in the short term until it actually ingests the smaller company.

Why do you think that the stock of HEXO rose on news of the takeover bid?

Dan McDermott: Well, I won’t take credit for John back there, but deal was done with no premium, and that’s significant, and usually you see a premium paid to the company, and that’s why, you know, people invest in these smaller companies hoping to get bought out. And this is a change from that norm, and it’s also a potential, maybe an omen for future companies, saying, wow, you know, we don’t have as much hype in the space; maybe those premiums are going to start shrinking a little bit, so maybe all these smaller companies, these smaller LPs that are looking for the potential of a buyout deal from a CGC or a bigger company, maybe they’re not going to get as good a deal.

So I think it has a bit of a ripple effect in terms of perhaps lowering expectations in terms of the premiums that smaller companies are going to receive in the near term future.

James West: Okay. All right, Dan, so what are we looking at, here?

Dan McDermott: So we’ve got CGC, this is a five to six week long pattern, and it’s just a tightening range, and if we were going to visualize this, it would be something along the lines of a pendulum, where the swings are getting smaller and smaller each time, and we’re going to reach what I call, this is an equilibrium pattern, and we reach a flex point where we literally can’t get any tighter. And when that pattern reaches that flex point and we get a clear break, we see a volume spike – so next week, we’re anticipating this pattern is going to break. And people that draw trendlines – I’m not much of a trendline-drawer myself, but if we were to do it here, you could just see visually it’s a tightening range that’s going to be forming.

So like I said, we’re anticipating a break next week. Here we are, coming down towards the support here, and the key levels to be watching: 43.71 on CGC as a support level, and our new resistance level that’s key is 48.01. So we’re going to see this range continue to tighten into next week; we’re going to see a volume spike somewhere along the lines of, oh, let’s say, 12 million-plus shares traded. Right now our 20-day average is about 7 million shares traded.

So the volume spike tells us the break is occurring, and we’re going to be looking for this break to dictate pretty much where we’re headed for April in terms of momentum. So I do believe, obviously, because this is the sector leader, in my opinion, that it’s going to have a significant impact on all the names in the sector. There will be some names that can, you know, go against the grain and do their own thing, but at a broader sense, this break of this CGC pattern is going to be really important for, again, end of March into April.

James West: Interesting. So the break that you’re speaking about, is this a sign that investors are getting sort of fatigued with the diminished performance potential as a result of this consolidation pattern, and that that’s going to cause some abandonment of the play?

Dan McDermott: One thing that we don’t do is, we don’t, you know, try and predict direction. So with these equilibrium patterns, they’re very common after a high volatility; so when we had this huge move back in January and February and we entered a new range, this is just price discovery; this is trying to find out, you know, where we stand, and so we’re not saying it’s going to be a bull break or a bear break, but we know a break is imminent. So if we get a bull break, we’re going to see shorts covered, and we’re going to see bulls pile on as we look to test the recent high of 51.81.

If we see a bear break, we’re going to see stop losses trigger, we’re going to see bears jump in, and there’s a lack of support down under 41.68, so we would potentially be looking to the upper $30 area as a target from there. So it really, it’s going to paint a completely different picture depending on which direction this break does occur.

James West: Wow. So I guess absent a fundamental catalyst, is it more likely, in your opinion, that we’re going to see a break to the downside, whereas if we do see something that would be considered fundamentally significant, that the break might happen to the upside?

Dan McDermott: I would say that the break right now is favoured to the upside for a number of reasons. Number one, the trend, just in the sense of where we are coming from: we’re coming off of a bull move, and this is a tightening pattern from that bull move. And Number two, the S&P 500 has really impressed me in terms of the resiliency of these bulls over the past three months since the December crash. They’ve held up extremely well, and we’ve got oil holding up extremely well. So until I see weakness in the S&P 500 or in oil, I’m not going to anticipate significant weakness in the MJ sector.

James West: Okay, do you have an S&P chart good to go, there?

Dan McDermott: Sure, we can pull it up. This is SPY, which is the ETF which tracks the S&P 500. Let’s clear up these lines. So just looking at the weekly time frame: again, the dump from December, we saw just a straight-up V-shaped recovery with no consolidation. We finally got the consolidation we were looking for, and it lasted all of pretty much one week, and just like that, the bulls are right back to the high of the bounce. So, holding on very strong, and at this point for me, we’re going to have to break the low of last week to see any kind of bearish momentum in this sector, or I should say in the markets as a whole.

So, 272.42 on SPY is a key level for me, and if we were to pull back into next week on SPY, back to the low 270s, that’s a scenario where I could foresee CGC breaking bearish. CRON is also at a pretty critical point in terms of coming up on a couple key supports: 19.50 and then down to 18.72, these are US numbers. But again, once these levels break, if they do break, there’s a lack of support immediately below those levels, just like there is on CGC. So bears could get a little bit of follow-through if it is indeed how it plays out.

James West: Uh-huh. Looking at the large cap cannabis companies, it seems like they’re all sort of falling into this pattern, this equilibrium pattern after the big spike in the first quarter of 2019. And is that more or less indicative of the potential for another summer downward drift absent sector-wide catalysts?

Dan McDermott: Yeah, we’re definitely looking for that. Seasonality has been a big part of the MJ sector for quite some time; we’ve talked about it on your show here in the past. So it is, I mean, and it’s almost a self-fulfilling prophecy to a certain degree, where this is the narrative that we’re seeing in chat rooms and in social media groups that are concerned with the sector. Just, you know, people are expecting that perhaps ‘sell in May, go away’ is going to be occurring in the space. and for a lot of names, I mean, it wouldn’t be a significant red flag if we were to see consolidation.

Just looking at CRON, the run that we saw back at the end of the year, I mean, we could pull back into the upper teens and still be just fine on a longer term picture with how significantly we have run. I mean, just looking back, we ran to 15.30; we gave back 50 percent of that move, and then saw a continuation. So if you are truly long term and you’re looking out, you know, three, five years plus, then weekly consolidation and a bear break of these daily patterns wouldn’t really be a major concern at this point.

James West: Wow, Dan, fascinating as per usual. I always learn so much when I’m talking to you. We’re going to leave it there for now; I’ll come back to you next week. Thanks so much for your input as usual.

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

The risk for the NDP strategy, even if daily reminders of the UCP leader’s flawed character and his party’s problem with extremists continue, is that they will get lost amid the daily policy announcements both parties and their smaller rivals are bound to make during an election campaign.

For a government generally perceived to be campaigning from behind its principal challenger in popular support, the campaign didn’t get off to a bad start from the NDP’s perspective, with near simultaneous revelations that more fines had been levied in the UCP’s “Kamikaze Campaign” scandal and that a high-profile UCP candidate had been forced to quit the race after her apparent white supremacist views became known.

On Tuesday, the day Premier Notley called the election, the Office of the Election Commissioner announced that it had levied two additional fines related to Jeff Callaway’s UCP leadership campaign in 2017, which has come to be known as the “Kamikaze Mission,” so called in a leaked recording of UCP strategists talking because its intent was allegedly not to win, but to knock off Mr. Kenney’s main rival, former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean.

The two $4,000 administrative penalties were levied against one Darcy McAllister. One was for contributing funds to the Callaway campaign that were furnished by another person, the other for “furnishing $4,000 to Maja McAllister, for purpose of making contribution to Jeff Callaway.”

The same day, it was learned that Caylan Ford, a star candidate personally recruited by Mr. Kenney to run in the Calgary-Mountain View riding had abruptly pulled out of the race after a progressive news site revealed she had complained that white supremacist terrorists are treated unfairly by the media compared with Islamic terrorists.

According to the report in Press Progress, Ms. Ford also expressed anxiety about “the replacement of white peoples in their homelands” and mused about the violent collapse of Western civilization as a result.

Since then, her uncomplimentary views on LGBTQ Pride Parades have also come to light. They are “a celebration of vice and transgression,” she opined, asking: “What are the redeeming values?”

Well, so much for the Caylan Ford campaign, for the moment anyway.

This in turn prompted an understandable debate on social media about Mr. Kenney’s own views, particularly on race and LGBTQ rights, and, whatever they are, what it is about the UCP that seems to attract such characters from the dark fringes of the right.

And the evening and the morning were the second day.

No time like an election to talk politics? Not at the U of A!

One would think there’d be no time like an election to talk about politics, especially at a university

But as it turns out, not everyone agrees. Leastways, certain folk appear to be uncomfortable with the idea of a brisk discussion that might lead to a critical consideration of the consequences of implementing some of the policies being proposed by the Opposition in the upcoming Alberta election.

A memorandum yesterday from the director of the Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life at the University of Alberta’s Augustana Campus in Camrose, for example, announced that a coffee and conversation event about Alberta politics planned for today would be cancelled because … wait for it … an election has been called!

“As you probably know, yesterday an election was called in Alberta,” wrote an apologetic-sounding Ian D. Wilson to the centre’s friends and supporters. “Now that campaigning has officially started, the U of A President’s Office has asked all units at the University to ensure that our activities do not influence the election in any way.” (Emphasis added.)

Say what?

“The goal of this Ronning Centre event was to facilitate an informed discussion about the interrelationship of religion and politics in the Alberta context, not to influence anyone’s political position during the election season,” Dr. Wilson said. “But in this case, given the timing of the election call, we think it is best to follow the President’s advice with due diligence and to cancel the event.”

Hmmmmm. For those of you who think an election might be an ideal time to talk about politics and policy, perhaps the explanation is that U of A President David Turpin took enough of a beating from the UCP over that honorary degree for environmentalist David Suzuki last year.

Well, there’s no point beating him up again this time, as the former University of Victoria president has already announced he’ll be outta here after June 2020. So, whatever the reason for his typically Albertan excess of election caution, he’s only going to have to put up with one more typical Alberta winter.

Chester Ronning, after whom the centre is named, would certainly not have had a problem with a briskly critical discussion of policy during an election, especially the kind of policies put forward by the UCP.

Born in 1894 in Xiangfan, China, to Christian missionaries, Mr. Ronning graduated from the University of Alberta in 1916 and returned to China in 1922 to continue his parents’ mission. He came back to Alberta in 1927 to serve as principal of the Camrose Lutheran College, which occupied the site that is now the U of A’s the Augustana Campus. Like Dr. Suzuki, he was awarded many honorary degrees.

Mr. Ronning served Canada as a diplomat in China, Norway and India, and led an attempt to bring a negotiated end to the Vietnam War in 1966.

In politics, he was elected as a United Farmers of Alberta MLA in 1932 and served as leader of the Alberta branch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the predecessor to the NDP, from 1940 to 1942.

The federal budget tabled by Finance Minister Bill Morneau focuses on the country’s finances while setting the stage for the impending fall election.

It’s targeted largely towards middle-class voters, with a particular spotlight on baby boomers and millennials – including exemptions aimed at helping low-income working seniors and a modernized home buyer plan for first-time buyers, for instance – rather than providing a clearly defined set of initiatives for small- to mid-sized Canadian businesses.

With that said, skills and training are a notable budget theme for 2019, with some potentially significant benefits to Canadian businesses, in particular startups and companies in the process of scaling up. Here are some of the key takeaways.

Canada Training Credit

Budget 2019 introduces measures to address the barriers to professional development for working Canadians, helping them to upskill in a rapidly evolving, increasingly digital-first workplace at a price tag of $1.7 billion over five years. The newly introduced Canada Training Credit provides assistance to small business owners, entrepreneurs and employees looking to increase skills in their chosen fields.

A refundable tax credit will be available, with claims beginning in late 2020, to help eligible Canadian individuals (aged between 25 to 64 years old) accumulate $250 per year (up to a maximum accumulation of $5,000 over a lifetime) to cover some of the costs of training to learn new job skills at eligible post-secondary institutions.

Canadians must also file a tax return to qualify, earn work wages in excess of $10,000 and have a net income that does not exceed the top of the third tax bracket ($147,667 for 2019). The amount of the refundable credit that can be claimed in a taxation year will be equal to the lesser of one-half of the eligible tuition and fees paid in respect of the year and the individual’s notional account balance. The refundable Canada Training Credit will reduce the amount that will qualify as an eligible expense for the tuition tax credit.

Moreover, a newly introduced EI training benefit aims to provide income support for up to four weeks of paid leave every four years for individuals who take time off work to attend a training program (at 55% of earnings). As an added incentive for small business owners, it’s anticipated they’ll earn a small tax break on their EI premiums, although that has yet to be formalized since EI rates will be set later in the year.

Scientific research incentives for growing Canadian private companies

Story continues below advertisement

Prior to the new budget announcement, Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) could access the enhanced Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit rate of 35% for expenditures up to $3 million every year.

Budget 2019 aims to better support small- and mid-sized businesses as they mature and scale up by eliminating the use of taxable income in the previous taxation year. Previously both taxable income and taxable capital of the associated group, whichever was higher, were used before Tuesday’s budget announcement when determining a CCPC’s annual expenditure limit and ability to access the refundable 35% tax credit rate.

Small business deduction for farming and fishing incomes

While much attention was paid in recent years to startups focused on using technology to disrupt existing industries, Budget 2019 also proposes to provide more relief for farming and fishing businesses. It plans to do this by counteracting measures introduced in 2016 which prevented CCPC’s “specified corporate income” from being eligible for a small business deduction. The exception will now be retroactively expanded to include a CCPC’s income from sales of farming products or fishing catches of its business to any arm’s-length purchaser corporation. This was previously only available for sales to co-operative corporations.

Canada-wide high-speed internet access by 2030

Another promise by the Trudeau government is 100% access to high-speed internet across Canada by the year 2030. While more of a long-term goal with total investment of $1.7 billion, this could have a positive impact on small businesses operating in rural areas of the country, could unlock new opportunities in the e-commerce sector and allow businesses to access previously untapped customers and markets.

Corporate rates and stock option deduction for small and growing businesses goes unchanged

Also of note: no changes were proposed to the corporate income tax rates or to the $500,000 small business income limit of a CCPC. Meanwhile, Budget 2019 seeks to limit the availability of the stock option deduction for “large, long-established, mature firms” to an annual maximum of $200,000 of stock option grants (based on the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant), while the stock option deduction will remain unchanged for startups and small businesses.

25,Politics,2019-03-21T16:52:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA — By calling a provincial election for April 16, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has opened a window for an early federal vote. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were so inclined, he could send Canadians to the polls before Canada Day. He would not ...","But until this week, it was not clear that the option of a presummer federal vote was even available.

Per Alberta law, Notley could have called the election for a vote to be held as late as May 31 — blocking off in the process most of the spring's political calendar.

It is easier to make a case for the Liberals using all the time at their disposal to allow the dust to settle on SNC-Lavalin than to explain why the Conservatives are not clamouring for an election.

Polls show the affair has taken a toll on Trudeau's electoral prospects. Still whether that damage is permanent remains an open question.

On balance, Tuesday's budget was well received. Anyone looking for a visionary document was left hungry. Finance Minister Bill Morneau's fourth budget will not go down in history for its structural impact on the country. As a rule, few pre-election budgets do.

But nor did it come across as the product of a government on its last legs, at a loss to spring back from the hits it has been taking for more than a month.

If anything, Morneau seemed more comfortable with his latest budget than with some of the previous ones. In his first years as a minister, he might have been destabilized by Conservative efforts to shout down his budget speech. That did not happen on Tuesday.

The opposition parties may want to prevent the government from moving on from this crisis, but anecdotal evidence suggests public fatigue with the SNC-Lavalin is already setting in. The federal budget alone will not change the conversation on Parliament Hill but other issues are moving up on the radar.

If the past is any indication, public patience with parliamentary guerrilla wars and those who instigate them tends to be limited.

For the better part of the past month Scheer has been arguing that the prime minister no longer has the moral authority to govern. On Trudeau's role in the SNC-Lavalin affair, he has already come to a conclusion.

The Conservative party is committed to paralyzing Parliament for as long as it takes for the government to cave to its demands — something that seems unlikely to happen between now and the election.

If Scheer believes his own rhetoric, should he not be calling for Canadians to be given the earliest possible opportunity to kick the Liberals out?

And yet, prior to and since Tuesday's budgets, he has had plenty of opportunities to call for an earlier election and he has so far passed on all of them.

Scheer is betting that weeks of parliamentary warfare will enhance his pre-election standing. As it happens so — at least for now — is Trudeau.

Having finally managed to deliver his last pre-election budget speech — which, as predicted right here in iPolitics AM, was delayed by more than hour, courtesy of a Conservative-led procedural protest maneuver that nevertheless failed to stop the clock on the release of the document itself, which was tabled by the minister shortly before 4 p.m., thus allowing the Liberals to spend the next 30 minutes touting the contents ahead of its official presentation to the House — Finance Minister Bill Morneau is off to Toronto for his now-traditional first post-budget breakfast appearance.

This year, he’ll outline his plan to “invest in the middle class” at an early morning event co-hosted by the Canadian Club Toronto, Empire Club of Canada and Toronto Region Board of Trade, which he’ll follow up with a Q&A with area reporters before returning to Ottawa for a “post-budget armchair discussion” with the Economic Club of Canada.

Back in the capital, meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will “highlight” his government’s newly announced “First-Time Home Buyer Incentive” during an afternoon visit to Orleans.

First, though, he’ll join Liberal MPs for their weekly confab on the Hill — the first, it’s worth noting, since the resignation of former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, who quit her post over concerns at how Trudeau and his team had handled the SNC-Lavalin controversy, but who, like former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, remains, at least for the moment, in caucus.

In the weeks since the departure of the two one-time senior front benchers, Trudeau has repeatedly stressed that it will be up to the caucus to collectively decide on their future within the Liberal ranks, which may or may not put it on the agenda for today’s discussions — which, of course, will take place far from the prying eyes and ears of the press.

Fear not, though: As is always the case on caucus day — and even more so when there’s the possibility of high drama behind closed doors — a full contingent of reporters will be stationed outside the West Block meeting room, ready and waiting with boom mics, cameras and a flurry of pointed questions for any MP who wanders within range.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives are hoping to shift the spotlight back to the former justice minister’s incendiary allegations of attempted political pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of the embattled Quebec engineering firm when they take temporary control of the Chamber this afternoon.

Last week, the party served notice that they intended to use their final opposition day of the winter supply cycle to call on Trudeau to drop any remaining constraints on Wilson-Rabould’s capacity to discuss the events that led to her resignation, a demand that the prime minister has thus far rebuffed.

That opposition motion was initially slated for Monday, but due to a last-minute change in programming, is now set to take place this afternoon, which, given the standard abbreviated Wednesday schedule, means that the Conservatives will have only a few hours to make the case for expanding the waiver to — as the now familiar chant goes — “let her speak.”

The Conservatives are also set to decide whether to launch the House into a voting marathon that could keep MPs in the Chamber until the wee small hours of the night — and possibly well into the next day — by triggering nearly 200 recorded divisions on the estimates, which, under parliamentary rules, must be passed by the end of the current sitting day.

Although the original plan was to use the estimates vote to delay the budget, the Liberals had sufficient warning to rejig the schedule to hold it today, but the threat of an overnight session is still very much in play — and entirely under the control of the Conservatives, who have vowed to use every available parliamentary tool to express their disapproval of the decision to shut down the House justice committee probe of the controversy.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

The budget, released Tuesday by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, is the fourth and last the Liberal government will table before the next federal election, set for October.

Overall, the budget delivers few big-ticket, signature programs but offers several programs targeting key electoral constituencies heading into the election campaign.

Across the North, the budget recommits to develop a new Arctic and Northern Policy Framework in consultations with Indigenous people and the Northern territories. But it doesn’t include a timeline for when that will be complete.

Here’s a breakdown with some of the other highlights for the territories.

Northwest Territories

One of the biggest individual spending promises for the Northwest Territories is $18 million over the next three years to start paying to expand the Taltson hydroelectric system.

That project is a key plank in the territory’s climate change plan, but the territory has long said it cannot pay for it without Ottawa’s help. Though there is not an up-to-date cost estimate, a 2014 business case priced the expansion at $1.2 billion.

Another $13 million has been promised for the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning starting this year and continuing over five years to deliver a “culturally appropriate and community-developed curriculum.”

In addition, the government also recommitted to amending the Canada National Parks Act to legally establish the Thaidene Nene National Park Reserve.

In February, members of the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation voted 89 per cent in favour of establishing the national park reserve.

Further reading: Small deficit projected in Northwest Territories budget

Nunavut

An addictions treatment facility has been promised for Nunavut, which has not had one in the territory for more than 20 years, according to budget documents.

Though the budget did not include a specific figure, that facility would be paid for through spending from the Nunavut government and other Inuit organizations.

The federal government also pledges to continue funding programs with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, such as $50 million over 10 years for the Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy, which was first announced in 2016. That is the exact figure Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami asked for in its pre-budget submissions.

The biggest news, I think, is the commitment for the addictions treatment facility in Nunavut. However, there isn't any money associated with it, and it seems contingent on funding from the Government of Nunavut, and ""Inuit partners."" pic.twitter.com/NHFpl7zqkk — Nick Murray (@NickMurray91) March 19, 2019

Overall, the budget lays out $286.2 million over five years in spending for Inuit-specific programs. That includes:

$125.5 million over 10 years for an Inuit-led post-secondary education strategy.

$50 million over 10 years to continue the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy.

$220 million over five years for health and social services for Inuit children.

Environment and Climate Change Canada has also been promised $21.8 million over five years for the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, for much-needed repairs at the Arctic research facility.

The federal government is also exploring creating a marine conservation area in the High Arctic Basin or Tuvaijuttuq, which is the last portion of the Arctic expected to retain summer sea ice until at least 2050.

In October, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the federal government signed an agreement in principle for a marine protected area for Tallurutiup Imanga, also referred to as Lancaster Sound.

Yukon

Yukon College has been promised $26 million over the next five years for a new science building on campus. This money is supposed to support the college’s transformation as “Canada’s first university in the North.”

The budget also recommits to return all direct proceeds from the federal carbon tax back to the Yukon and Nunavut governments. The Northwest Territories has already released its carbon pricing plan.

Northern Quebec: Makivik Corporation reacts to federal budget “In relation to Makivik’s mandate, today’s Federal budget announcement will help address issues related to the Inuit and the Arctic,” said Charlie Watt, president of Makivik Corporation, the land claims organization representing the Inuit of Northern Quebec, in a press release. Watt welcomes the budget’s funding for post secondary education, suicide prevention, health and social services for Inuit children and Indigenous languages, as well as a measure to forgive or reimburse land claim loans.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

On the season two finale of Political Blind Date, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant and Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus debate the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement. ( TVO )

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

Article Continued Below

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive. Conservatives want to change the agreement with the U.S. to allow Canada to send those claiming refugee status after crossing at irregular locations back to the U.S.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, while standing at the north side of Roxham Road, the Quebec location where the majority of border crossings have happened over the last two years for irregular asylum claimants.

30,,2019-03-21T07:30:00.0000000Z,Former Competition Bureau commissioner John Pecman notes a federal election is looming ... laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a ...,"Canadians like to believe they live in one of the most sophisticated free-market economies in the world. Don’t tell that to John Pecman. Until May of last year, Pecman was commissioner of the Competition Bureau, the agency responsible for enforcing laws against anti-competitive practices in the Canadian marketplace.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

After he stepped down in September 2018, he published an article in the Canadian Competition Law Review that called for reforms to give the bureau more power to check corporate concentration, including added independence by separating it from the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.

In a phone interview with The Tyee last week, Pecman elaborated, saying that federal laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a resource exporter and otherwise unable to compete with the big U.S. economy next door.

This led to laws favouring corporate consolidation in the name of “efficiency” over promoting competition or the interests of consumers.

The Competition Bureau he ran lacks the independence that would make it truly effective, he said — a vulnerability to political meddling that brings to mind other headline grabbing moments in Ottawa of late.

“Scarce enforcement resources” further erode the bureau’s ability to take initiative, he noted. The Trudeau government trimmed the bureau’s already strained budget to help cover a $950-million industry initiative called “superclusters,” says Pecman.

When it comes to not just studying market concentration but moving to break it up, says Pecman, Canada is “so far behind other western economies on this front. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area.”

Here is more of what Pecman, who spent 34 years at the bureau and now is senior business advisor at the nation-wide law firm Fasken, had to say...

On why it’s time to get the Competition Bureau out of the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development:

“If you look at any international body’s recommendations on institutional framework and design for competition authorities, the number one no-no is to be housed in the industry department that’s there supporting business, particularly [corporate] ‘national champions.’ Of course the industry department is probably the most lobbied department, so there’s the perception of political interference.”

On years of competition law foot-dragging in Canada:

“Competition law has been sort of shunned to the side, other than there were some serious amendments in 2010. I think particularly when you’re reading the papers today and [headlines reflecting] the angst about monopolies and IT giants, and corporate concentration and income inequality, we haven’t heard much from the government on any plans to study these issues.

“There have been calls outside of my requests from time to time to look at the law. For example, Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada. During her speech this past year at the G7, she raised a concern about the growth of the IT giants and its impact on labour.”

On ‘scarce resources’ and ignored cases:

“Notably, on the abuse of [corporate market] dominance or consumer protection and deceptive marketing practices, particularly on the latter part, we receive more complaints than we have resources. We have to be careful, the bureau does, where to invest our scarce enforcement resources.”

On the big 2008 recommendation never enacted:

“If you are familiar at all with the competition review policy report done by L.R. (Red) Wilson [for the Canadian Council of Chief Executives] back in 2008... the largest recommendation that they made was to create an independent Canadian competitiveness council that would report to parliament that would do the advocacy and the policy work for competition. And that was not adopted by the previous government or this government.”

On how Canada lags behind other nations, hurting innovation:

“There is a huge gap. Most countries around the world have their competition authorities spending significant budgets to work in terms of promoting competition. In Canada, that’s just not the case. It depends on the discretion of the commissioner. There is no expressed authority to do it.

“To me, there needs to be some clarification of the importance of competition policy and advocacy in Canada with expressed authority to do that kind of work — whether it’s referred back to an independent competitiveness council to do the work or give the authority to the competition bureau. Someone has to do it.

“It’s hurting the competitiveness of the country not focusing on that, including the innovation agenda. The number one driver of innovation is competition.”

On why the Competition Bureau is ‘spinning its wheels’ because it can’t make regulations:

“We are so far behind other western economies on this front. It’s just disappointing. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area, knowing how powerful it is.

“Let’s take a good example — FinTech (Financial Technology). We engaged in a serious market study on the whole question of financial services technology. We put together a significant consultation and put out a report with 30 recommendations, including moving to an open banking system whereby consumers can move their banking data easily to competitors, whether it’s FinTechs or other banks, to facilitate competition, lower prices, better services.

“The government, in its last speech in the throne, identified this as important and in finances started to look at the issue.

“But in England, their competition authority did a robust market study because [unlike Canada] they can compel information from companies. Then it issued regulations. So England is about a year ahead of us. They’ve actually implemented open banking. And the FinTech companies and services and banking service fees have gone down significantly in the U.K. And FinTech is twice the size in Europe as it is in Canada.

“So there’s an example of the importance of competition advocacy in changes by government to facilitate competition and the benefits to the marketplace, where consumers have greater choice, lower prices, better services, better quality.

“And so, we’re spinning our wheels on open banking. The finance department is going to study this for years and who knows where it is going to end up?

“It just speaks to the lower priority competition policy has in Canada, in my view, compared to Europe, Australia, the U.S.”

On why Canada tolerates such high corporate concentration:

“I think it has to do with the fact is that we’re a small open economy next to the U.S. Economic thinking back in the ‘60s was that we needed to have large economies of scale in order to be competitive internationally. And of course, Canada has significant barriers to foreign competition in many sectors, whether it’s the financial services, transport, agriculture, just go down the list.

“The government has created economic policies that create corporate concentration, with the view of becoming more competitive internationally. I think that’s the thinking behind it. Whether it’s been successful or not, you can be the judge of that.”

On why ‘efficiencies’ enriching corporate shareholders supersede consumer interests:

“The ‘efficiencies defence’ was part of that thinking [that], in Canada, having larger companies to compete internationally was important. So this defence, which is an outright defence [supporting] an anti-competitive merger, was implemented. And we’re unique in that. I think we’re the only major economy in the world that has this defence, whereby an anti-competitive merger could proceed because of cost savings. Sometimes just static cost savings going to shareholders are more significant than potential higher prices to consumers or other businesses.

“It’s something that I don’t believe we should be an outlier on.”

On how consumer resentment may fuel populism:

“I just think [the efficiencies defence] needs a rethink, particularly when you’re looking at the whole issue of populism, corporate concentration and income inequality. In Canada, we can clear mergers to create increases in concentrations — further increases in concentration — because of cost savings that go to shareholders from a merger transaction. Increases that could be one-time, that do not benefit the economy at all writ large.”

On Canada’s own monopoly game, and why it’s rigged:

“I’m concerned about the rules that have created the concentration in Canada. Concentration per se, is not a problem. That is the end game for any company in a business — they want to become a monopoly. And if you earned organically and not through anti-competitive processes, more power to you! You’ve got a better mouse trap, you can reap the monopoly benefits of that.

“That’s not what competition laws are designed to prevent. They’re preventing abuses in a monopoly situation, or once you’ve emerged to become a monopoly. That’s what competition laws are in place to do.

“So really, the concentration piece doesn’t bother me, it’s how these companies are able to obtain concentration in Canada. It’s not through open, competitive markets. It’s through protection from government, protecting companies against competition.

“That’s the concern I have in Canada, with regard to our foreign investment rules, our supply management rules, our efficiency defences — those are my concerns with our process in Canada.”

On whether corporate concentration and competition could be an election issue this fall:

“I think it’s starting to make its way back to the front pages, and people may be following. But generally speaking, it’s an obtuse area that most don’t pay attention to. And so it rarely makes it as a priority in politicians’ platforms because it’s not a big vote-getter at the end of the day.

“But there’s a federal election coming up and, you know, what better way of targeting the middle class or consumers than saying there’s going to be a review of the Competition Act, given the growing concern about corporate concentration. To me it’s an easy, low-hanging fruit. But I haven’t seen any talk about that yet in Canada.”",Monopoly-Friendly Canada ‘Does Not Treat Competition Policy Seriously’,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/03/19/Monopoly-Friendly-Canada-Competition-Policy/

The reality for Justin Trudeau is that he needs these goodies in a way he didn't think he would.

He was exceptional in courting millennials in the 2015 election but lost their attention by doing such things as jettisoning electoral reform and sluggishly legalizing cannabis.

article continues below

Now he has found a way to help them buy their first homes and stay in his tent.

He was focused in his first mandate on helping lift people into the middle class, even though there are so many other ways to pick their pockets.

Now he has found late-stage promises like mid-life learning support to induce their support at the polls in the fall.

He forgot entirely about seniors.

Now in his budget, he is signalling his understanding of the necessary commitment to them - they, after all, vote in disproportionate numbers, and there are more and more of them and more to come.

Enter the prospect of pharmacare, if still faint in nature.

He appeared at first benign about business, then ham-handed in handling small business concerns about taxation and big business concerns about competitiveness and productivity.

On the former, he has generally patched things up over time, with some hard feelings remaining; on the latter, his budget Tuesday suggests he either doesn't think it matters for his political health or doesn't actually care. The yellowing and reform-needing tax code might outlive the lifespan of paper.

You can almost hear someone saying: ""Businesses don't vote. People do.""

Some governments would look at the recent operating surplus and say it was time to prune taxes as the country is stricken with economic stagnation and heads toward the first round of uncertainty in a decade.

That would leave some manoeuvrability if the storm hits shore. But the Liberals have determined in the time-honoured tradition of election cycles that it is again the moment to spend - as they have in their first term, for that matter, at a 6.5 per cent annual rate of growth - to improve their lately shakier odds of re-election.

For a government that has been at the helm during prosperous times, the Liberals have not demonstrated much interest in scrubbing the balance sheet.

Its projections suggest the deficit for the year ending March 31 will drop to $14.9 billion from $19 billion - thanks to revenue, not prudence - then rocket again to nearly $20 billion in the following two years.

Their optimism is that it is halved by 2023-24, after the second-next election.

They haven't extensively targeted spending programs that have outlived usefulness, nor particularly enabled through some support programs the next wave of wealth generation.

The extra $1.4 billion commitment to skills training will not hurt - workers 25 to 64 will accumulate credits of $250 annually to a maximum $5,000 - but will not necessarily align the needs of the labour market because they are not particularly targeted.

You will need to read the budget documents and fall listlessly into a hallucination to find anything to propel investment or corporate tax competitiveness.

In riding the revenue wave and pointing to lifetime lows in unemployment, the Liberals have taken a what-me-worry? pose.

They are content to sustain a debt-to-GDP ratio, maybe lower it a bit - all the while rolling out nearly $23 billion in new programs in the half-dozen years ahead.

This spendthrifty character could be a regret in a matter in a year or so, but that is a matter for a year or so.

Meantime there is an election machinery that needs to fire on all cylinders, have talking points for each riding it hounds, and nothing approaching sour medicine to spoon out.

To that end, Finance Minister Bill Morneau is straight out of Central Casting in the role of using our money - and, I suppose, our childrens' - to supply the illusion of improvement in our lives.

As measles outbreaks become more common, Canada still lacks key data

Story continues below advertisement

When Vancouver experienced a measles outbreak at three schools last month, it took the local health authority a week to track down the vaccination records for 20 per cent of the students. The delay complicated the response, and made it more difficult to determine which students might have been most at risk of the contagious disease.

The root of the problem, reports Wendy Stueck, lies in Canada’s glaring data gaps: Parents in nearly every province and territory aren’t required to provide schools with immunization records; there’s no national online registry of vaccinations; records don’t carry over when people move or travel across provincial boundaries; paper records are still being used to varying degrees in New Brunswick and Nunavut.

As a result of the data gaps, we don’t have a clear sense of Canada’s overall vaccine coverage: The measles vaccination rate for two-year-olds is 89 per cent, according to a 2015 national survey, well below the 95-per-cent threshold recommended to reach “herd immunity.” But the survey is just an estimate (officials say the number is likely higher due to a low response rate).

Rise of outbreaks: The Vancouver outbreak comes as high increases in measles cases occur worldwide, with the World Health Organization calling vaccine hesitancy one of the top global health threats in 2019. Ukraine alone had more than 24,000 measles cases in the first two months of this year.

Fighting misinformation: The threat posed by anti-vaxxers and those who are wary of vaccinations has prompted Canada’s Public Health Agency to launch an education campaign to counter false narratives, while health centres across Canada have started to go as far as banning unvaccinated individuals from their facilities.

New Zealand is banning semi-automatic weapons

All military-style weapons and assault rifles will be banned within weeks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said as her country responds to the deadly Christchurch mosque shootings that left 50 dead and dozens more injured. New Zealand will also be implementing a buy-back program for the banned weapons.

Thousands are expected to attend a Friday prayer service tomorrow across the street from the Al Noor mosque where at least 42 were killed. The mosque is planning to reopen for services next week, with some workers offering their services for free to speed up repairs.

SNC-Lavalin says it never cited job losses as a reason for a settlement

CEO Neil Bruce also told The Globe that his firm “never threatened anybody” about moving its head office out of Canada as an argument for settling its criminal corruption trial. He also pointed out that federal legislation doesn’t allow for economic reasons to be used as an argument against prosecution. (for subscribers)

The comments stand in contrast with testimony by retiring Privy Clerk Michael Wernick and ex-principal secretary Gerald Butts; Wernick said officials believed there was a risk of SNC moving, while both he and Butts repeatedly cited the possibility of job losses.

Bruce said the possibility of a headquarter move might have been discussed in the event of a negative outcome in the criminal case, noting “we need to make alternative arrangements” should SNC be banned from federal contracts.

Separately, the Liberals used their majority in the House of Commons to defeat a Conservative motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to let Jody Wilson-Raybould give further testimony on the SNC fallout. (for subscribers)

The OPP hiring process was ‘flawed’ – but Doug Ford didn’t break any rules, a report says

Ontario’s Integrity Commissioner said the Premier kept his distance from the decision to hire his friend Ron Taverner for the province’s top police job. But Commissioner J. David Wake “found that there were some troubling aspects of the recruitment process and ultimately made the finding that the process was flawed.” While Ford called the findings “a complete vindication,” the NDP is renewing calls for a public inquiry.

The report detailed the ways Ford’s government had tried to hire Taverner for previous positions, including a senior role at the Ontario Cannabis Store. The outgoing deputy minister of community safety is also quoted saying he was told another public servant felt under pressure to hire “a friend of the Fords.” That public servant, Steve Orsini, later denied making those remarks.

Carter pitches athletes on Moscow Olympic boycott

Open this photo in gallery (Bettmann/Getty Images) Bettmann / Getty Images

March 21, 1980: No one applauded as president Jimmy Carter entered the East Room of the White House. Nearly 100 top American athletes were there to hear his argument in favour of boycotting the coming Summer Olympics in Moscow. Most left the March 21 meeting unconvinced. Carter proposed the boycott in January, 1980, shortly after Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in support of the country’s struggling communist regime. Fearing a larger push toward the oil-rich Persian Gulf, Carter demanded Soviet troops withdraw and threatened a boycott of the Moscow Olympics as an ultimatum. The boycott proved a hard sell. Prime minister Joe Clark threw Canada’s support behind the plan, and kept Canadian athletes away from the Games. But other NATO allies, including France and Britain, declined to follow suit. At home, American athletes complained bitterly. “The only way to compete against Moscow is to stuff it down their throats in their own backyard,” gold-medal-winning discus thrower Al Oerter said. Carter eventually persuaded the United States Olympic Committee to support his plan, and American athletes stayed home. Soviet athletes returned the favour four years later, boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. – Mark Rendell

By The Canadian Press on March 20, 2019.

SILKEBORG, Denmark – Chelsea Carey’s Canadian rink bounced back with a much-needed 8-7 win over China’s Jie Mei on Wednesday at the world women’s curling championship.

The win improved the Calgary-based team’s record to 4-4 as it aims to avoid becoming the first Canadian rink to miss the playoffs at the women’s worlds since 1999.

Canada was in a three-way tie for sixth with Scotland and the United States after the second of three draws on Wednesday. The top six teams in the 13-rink event make the playoffs.

Carey scored three on a draw in the ninth to wipe out a two-point deficit and then held on for the win against a Chinese team (6-2) that entered the draw in a tie for first.

China settled for one in the 10th, giving Canada the win.

Stolen singles in the fifth and seventh ends gave Canada a 5-4 lead before China responded with a deuce in the eighth to go up 6-5.

Canada lost both its games on Tuesday to fall below .500.

The game against China was Canada’s lone contest on Wednesday.

Canada faces Switzerland (4-3) and Russia (6-2) on Thursday.

OKLAHOMA CITY–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The board of directors of Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN) announced today that Ann G. Fox and Keith O. Rattie have been nominated to stand for election to the board at the company’s annual meeting of stockholders on June 5.

Fox, 42, is the president and chief executive officer of Nine Energy Service Inc. (NYSE: NINE), a Houston-based oilfield services company with operations throughout the U.S. and Canada. Rattie, 65, is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar Corp. (NYSE: STR), a natural gas-focused energy company based in Salt Lake City.

Devon announced in November that board chairman John Richels will not seek re-election at the 2019 annual meeting and will retire from the board at that time. Given Richels’ pending retirement, if the full slate of proposed directors wins election, including Fox and Rattie, Devon’s board will expand to 11 members, 10 of whom would be independent directors.

“Ann and Keith will bring impressive credentials, experience and perspective to our board,” Richels said. “We’re excited about having their many skills and insights at Devon at this important time for our company.”

Fox joined Nine Energy Service in February 2013 and served as CFO and vice president of strategic development before being named president and CEO in 2015. She also serves on the company’s board of directors. Before joining Nine, Fox worked for SCF Partners, a private-equity firm supporting the oilfield services and equipment industries. Her responsibilities there included evaluating and executing new investment opportunities and supporting ongoing portfolio initiatives. While at SCF, she participated in the firm’s investor committee and held the position of managing director.

Fox graduated from Georgetown University with a Bachelor of Science degree in diplomacy and security in world affairs. Immediately upon graduation, she worked as an investment banking analyst in New York. From 2001 to 2007, Fox was as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and served several tours of duty in Iraq. Following her service in the Marine Corps, she earned her Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School.

Rattie joined Questar Corp. as president in 2001. He was named CEO in 2002 and chairman in 2003. Following his retirement as president and CEO in 2010, Rattie served as non-executive chairman of Questar from 2010 to 2012. He continued to serve as a director of Questar until 2014. Before joining Questar, Rattie served as senior vice president of Coastal Corp., a diversified energy company, from 1995 to 2001. Prior to that, Rattie spent 19 years with Chevron Corp. in various engineering and management positions of increasing responsibility, including general manager of Chevron’s international gas unit.

Rattie currently serves on the boards of Ensco PLC (NYSE: ESV), a London-based offshore drilling contractor, and Select Energy Services Inc. (NYSE: WTTR), an oilfield services company. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington and a Master of Business Administration degree from St. Mary’s College.

""They're recognizing that the investment levels are down, they're recognizing that prices are down and that unemployment is up, and yet they're not really taking any meaningful action to support our industry,"" the group’s vice-president of oilsands, Ben Brunnen, said as quoted by CBC.

""The reality is, when we see those indicators all facing down, from an oil and gas perspective, and no recognition from the government of a willingness to support our industry, it's a pretty strong message towards our industry that we're not a priority for this government, and that's disappointing,"" Brunnen added.

The budget includes funds for retraining initiatives that could help with Alberta’s high unemployment problem, but according to CAPP, this is not enough.

Alberta’s oil industry may not be a priority for Ottawa, but it certainly is a priority for everyone running in this year’s elections, scheduled for April 16. The Canadian Press reported this week that oil and gas investments and carbon tax were central topics on the campaign trail.

Incumbent Premier Rachel Notley has promised to increase local oil and gas processing capacity while her rival from the United Conservative party, Jason Kenney, focused on the carbon tax approved by the Notley government.

Notley’s plan aims to reduce the amount of crude oil Alberta exports, therefore reducing the need for transportation capacity including pipelines—nowhere in sight—and oil trains. It should bring in tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments.

Kenney, on the other hand, promised his first order of business would be to repeal the carbon tax that is “punishing” Albertans. This, he said, would save the province more than US$1billion (C$1.4 billion) every year “in one fell swoop.”

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA- The federal Liberal government plans to spend $4.5 billion over the next five years to try to narrow the socio-economic gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people- part of a plan to keep reconciliation at the forefront of this fall’s campaign narrative.

Speaking to reporters inside the budget lockup, Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed the Liberals have been committed to reconciliation from the beginning of their mandate.

“It is a continuation of what we’ve been doing since Day One,’’

Morneau said. “It is driven by the fact that we know in this country, we need to get this right. We’ve got a lot of work to do and we are going to stay on it.’’

Part of the budget pledge is $1.2 billion over three years, $404 million per year beginning in 2019-2020, to develop a long-term approach for services for First Nations children.

The policy is named after a Manitoba First Nations boy from Norway House Cree Nation, Jordan River Anderson, who had multiple disabilities. When he was two years old, doctors recommended he move to a special home suited to his medical needs.

He died three years later, after jurisdictional squabbles between federal and provincial governments over payment for his care.

“It should be no surprise that we continue to deal with issues, like Jordan’s Principle, that we’ve been talking about for a long time,’’ Morneau said.

The budget also includes plans to invest $220 million over five years, beginning in 2019-2020, to provide services to Inuit children who face unique challenges to get health and social services due to the remoteness of their communities and limited availability of culturally appropriate care.

The Liberal government is communicating in the budget it is serious about its commitment to Indigenous Peoples, said Rebekah Young, the director of fiscal and provincial economics with Scotiabank.

“We are looking at almost $5 billion (in new spending) over five years, of a total budget spend of $20 billion,’’ she said. “We are talking about a quarter of the budget.’’

The federal budget also includes plans to move ahead with responding to calls to act from the Truth and Reconciliation that spent six years probing the dark legacy of Canada’s residential schools.

The spending plan includes $126.5 million in 2020-21 to establish a national council on reconciliation designed to serve as a permanent reminder of the fraught past between Canada and Indigenous Peoples and to contribute to better understanding of it. There is also $333.7 million over the next five years earmarked for helping to revitalize Indigenous languages, a move that follows legislation introduced in February.

The funding will help create a commissioner of Indigenous languages, the budget said, adding that only one in seven Indigenous children reports being able to carry on a conversation in an Indigenous language.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said there is no relationship more important than the Canadian government’s with Indigenous Peoples, though some Indigenous leaders and the federal NDP have raised concerns about the rate of progress on the file.

In yesterday’s federal budget, the government announced its “intention to work with provinces and territories towards the creation of a National School Food Program.” The one-sentence declaration was tucked into Liberals’ sprawling 464-page federal budget, the last of this government before Canadians head to the polls in October.

No money was earmarked in the budget for the proposed policy. It’s also uncertain whether a national program can be achieved given funding costs and potential provincial opposition to the federal Liberals’ idea.

Although there is a patchwork of existing local and provincial programs in the country providing funding for food for school children from junior kindergarten to Grade 12, Canada is the only G7 country and member of the 30-plus-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to lack a national school meal program, according to a 2016 report by two Simon Fraser University business professors.

The proposed school program in the budget was grouped with the unveiling of a $134-million national food policy designed to increase Canadians’ access to healthy foods, promote domestically grown and harvested food, support food security in the North, and reduce food waste.

Debbie Field, co-ordinator for the Coalition for Healthy School Food, called the proposal a “huge deal,” comparing it to other major social welfare programs.

“It’s a major social policy initiative,” she said. “Sometimes one line in a budget like this creates national pharmacare or other things like that. It really is at that level.”

Ms. Field said a national school meal program can help address children’s access to healthy and nutritious foods. In terms of this metric, Canada lags behind most other rich countries.

A 2017 UNICEF report ranked Canada 37th of 41 wealthy countries when it comes to food security, ending hunger, and improving nutrition. The report suggested a national school meal program could contribute to improvements in children’s healthy eating.

Poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and food insecurity are often problems for people living on lower incomes and those belonging to marginalized populations. Studies have also shown that healthy eating can correlate with improved educational outcomes.

“It’s a great first step and the coalition is looking forward to working with the federal government,” said Ms. Field.

Liberal MP Julie Dabrusin (Toronto-Danforth, Ont.) has pushed her government to put in place a school meals program, and is currently sponsoring a petition calling for the creation of an “adequately-funded national cost-shared universal healthy school food program.” Retired Liberal Senator Art Eggleton also put forward a similar motion calling for such an initiative in June 2018.

In a March 20 phone interview, Ms. Dabrusin said the proposed program will “look different in different places.”

“The idea is to work with different provinces and territories with the programs that they want to establish,” she said. “And when you think about it, what the different types of foods people might eat in parts of the country might be different, the needs might be different as to how to best deliver it.”

Ms. Dabrusin said there are many reasons why children may not decide to eat or have access to healthy and nutritious foods, but that it’s important the proposed program is universally available and doesn’t stigmatize poor students.

“There is a tremendous cost to having kids being hungry in school,” she said. “And I hear it from teachers who keep granola bars in their desk to feed kids, because they know that if the kids are hungry [they] can’t concentrate and participate in class.”

In a pre-budget submission to the House Finance Committee, Ms. Field’s organization asked for the Liberal government to invest $360-million, through provincial and territorial transfers, into a school food program, with an eventual goal of universal coverage.

Ms. Field said the total national cost of such a school meal program would be around $1.8-billion a year. That calculation is based on multiplying the number of Canadian children enrolled in schools—currently about five million—by the number of school days and an estimated price per meal of $2.

Oliver Anderson, a spokesperson for Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau (Compton-Stanstead, Que.), said “our government believes that all Canadians should have access to safe, healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate, and local food.” He said the food policy includes taking the “first steps” towards a national school meal program.

“We will have more to share on this in the weeks and months to come,” he said in an email.

The previous Conservative government under Stephen Harper, however, was cool to the idea of a national school meal program, with a Health Canada departmental spokesperson telling The Tyee in 2014: “The provision of food in schools is a provincial and territorial responsibility.”

In 1946, the United States created its national school meal program. In 2016, 30 million American children participated in the initiative providing free or low-priced meals at a cost of $13.6-billion for taxpayers, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures.

The program works by offering school districts and independent schools cash subsidies and government-bought food for each reimbursable meal they serve, which is required to meet federal standards.

The standards are a source of political contention, however, with the Trump administration loosening Obama-era requirements on grains, salt, and milk in 2017.

Ms. Field said Canada can follow the example of its G7 counterpart of France, or the example set by Finland, which she said have the best national programs in the world. She said their programs offer cooked, healthy, culturally appropriate, and often locally sourced foods.

Food insecurity is a challenge experienced at some level by four million Canadians, according to research done by PROOF, a University of Toronto-based research group studying policy choices to reduce the problem. It also found that household food insecurity affects one in six Canadian children.

Ms. Field described the current coverage of school food through provincial and locally funded school food programs as a “hodgepodge.”

“We all pride ourselves on our health-care system. We all pride ourselves on the fact that Canada has more progressive social policy than the U.S. on many issues,” Ms. Field said. “But we’re not doing well on this.”

Rattie, 65, is the former chairman, president and chief ...","The board of directors of Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN) announced today that Ann G. Fox and Keith O. Rattie have been nominated to stand for election to the board at the company’s annual meeting of stockholders on June 5.

Fox, 42, is the president and chief executive officer of Nine Energy Service Inc. (NYSE: NINE), a Houston-based oilfield services company with operations throughout the U.S. and Canada. Rattie, 65, is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar Corp. (NYSE: STR), a natural gas-focused energy company based in Salt Lake City.

Devon announced in November that board chairman John Richels will not seek re-election at the 2019 annual meeting and will retire from the board at that time. Given Richels’ pending retirement, if the full slate of proposed directors wins election, including Fox and Rattie, Devon’s board will expand to 11 members, 10 of whom would be independent directors.

“Ann and Keith will bring impressive credentials, experience and perspective to our board,” Richels said. “We’re excited about having their many skills and insights at Devon at this important time for our company.”

Fox joined Nine Energy Service in February 2013 and served as CFO and vice president of strategic development before being named president and CEO in 2015. She also serves on the company’s board of directors. Before joining Nine, Fox worked for SCF Partners, a private-equity firm supporting the oilfield services and equipment industries. Her responsibilities there included evaluating and executing new investment opportunities and supporting ongoing portfolio initiatives. While at SCF, she participated in the firm’s investor committee and held the position of managing director.

Fox graduated from Georgetown University with a Bachelor of Science degree in diplomacy and security in world affairs. Immediately upon graduation, she worked as an investment banking analyst in New York. From 2001 to 2007, Fox was as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and served several tours of duty in Iraq. Following her service in the Marine Corps, she earned her Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School.

Rattie joined Questar Corp. as president in 2001. He was named CEO in 2002 and chairman in 2003. Following his retirement as president and CEO in 2010, Rattie served as non-executive chairman of Questar from 2010 to 2012. He continued to serve as a director of Questar until 2014. Before joining Questar, Rattie served as senior vice president of Coastal Corp., a diversified energy company, from 1995 to 2001. Prior to that, Rattie spent 19 years with Chevron Corp. in various engineering and management positions of increasing responsibility, including general manager of Chevron’s international gas unit.

Rattie currently serves on the boards of Ensco PLC (NYSE: ESV), a London-based offshore drilling contractor, and Select Energy Services Inc. (NYSE: WTTR), an oilfield services company. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington and a Master of Business Administration degree from St. Mary’s College.

By The Canadian Press on March 20, 2019.

DURHAM, N.C. – Canadian basketball star R.J. Barrett has been named the National Player of the Year by USA Today.

The 18-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., leads the ACC in scoring with an average of 22.9 points a game, and helped the Duke Blue Devils to the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament.

Barrett set both the Duke and ACC freshman scoring records with his 799 points. Against top 10-ranked teams this season, Barrett’s scoring average of 25.5 leads the NCAA.

Barrett is the only major conference player to score more than 13 points in every game this season. He’s also seventh in the conference in assists (4.12), 10th in rebounding (7.5), and 10th in field goal percentage (45.7).

Barrett was also a USA Today all-American selection, adding to the all-American honours from USBWA and Sporting News. Barrett and teammate Zion Williamson are both finalists for the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Year Award, the Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year and the John R. Wooden Player of the Year Award.

The Blue Devils open March Madness on Friday in Columbia, S.C., against North Carolina Central or North Dakota State.

Some 57,000 asylum seekers from Nigeria, El Salvador, Honduras, and other nations crossed the U.S. border into Canada last year, in some cases citing a fear of persecution by the government of U.S. Donald Trump.

They are allowed to stay until their cases have been heard. Given Canada’s clogged judicial system, that could take years.

Canada said on Tuesday it planned to spend an additional C$1.2 billion ($902 million) over five years to stem the flow of irregular migrants from the United States, which has become a political threat to the Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Canada began prioritising the deportation of asylum seekers who walked across the border last year, in a bid to tackle the politically sensitive issue.

In the annual budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Ottawa would implement a comprehensive border enforcement strategy “to detect and intercept individuals who cross Canadian borders irregularly and who try to exploit Canada’s immigration system.”

Most arrive in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars taking care of the newcomers. Critics complain that Ottawa is not doing enough to deter the migrants and Liberals concede the issue is hitting the party’s popularity.

According to the budget, the government will start spending the C$1.2 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year to strengthen the border and speed up the asylum process. Ottawa will also try to “better manage, discourage and prevent irregular migration,” the budget text said.

Canadian officials have over the past two years visited Nigeria, as well as various ethnic communities in the United States, to try to persuade would-be migrants to stay put.

The officials have said that although the people driving the migrant surge claim that everyone who crosses the border is allowed to stay, most are sent back once their cases have been handled.

Trudeau thanked the clerk for his “extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades” and credited his government’s accomplishments “definite ...","OTTAWA—The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country’s top public servant, having concluded he’s lost the trust of opposition parties.

Opposition parties have been calling for the clerk of the Privy Council’s resignation since he first vehemently rejected allegations that he and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Wernick’s combative testimony to the House of Commons justice committee was denounced as partisan and unbecoming of a senior bureaucrat.

Also on Monday, the Liberals who make up a majority on that committee said publicly that they believe it has done all it can, or should, to investigate the affair.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, Wernick said he will retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off. He noted that the clerk is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign, as part of a new federal watchdog panel, and is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government—two roles he no longer believes he can fulfil.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” Wernick wrote. “I wish to relinquish these roles before the election. It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world-leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

Wernick, who has served in senior public service roles for nearly 38 years, has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould has accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t cave in to pressure last fall from Trudeau and his senior staff to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya. She has said they pushed her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would have forced the company to pay stiff penalties but let it avoid the risk of a criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about undue pressure only surfaced publicly after she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She resigned from cabinet a month later. Her exit was followed by the departure of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and then the resignation from cabinet of Jane Philpott, who cited loss of confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Wernick’s decision to quit as well proves “this SNC-Lavalin scandal is even bigger than we thought,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.

Trudeau said he intends to name Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace Wernick.

On his way into the House of Commons, Trudeau thanked the clerk for his “extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades” and credited his government’s accomplishments “definitely in large part” to Wernick’s leadership of the public service. Trudeau did not respond when asked if he’d sought Wernick’s resignation but his office later said he had not.

Wernick’s letter was released minutes before MPs reconvened for their first question period after a two-week March break, an exchange that proved explosive almost from the get-go.

Opposition members erupted in protest when Trudeau announced he’d appointed former Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan as a special adviser to explore what he called “important questions” about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice, who plays a dual role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

McLellan “will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation, of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,” the prime minister said in a statement. “She will consider whether machinery-of-government or legislative changes may or may not be recommended.”

“Her work will be another important step towards maintaining Canadians’ confidence in their institutions,” he told the Commons.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer mocked the announcement as nothing more than saying “Liberals will investigate Liberals.”

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus ridiculed the idea of a Liberal minister from the era of the sponsorship scandal looking into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which he dubbed “a five-alarm dumpster fire.”

As for Wernick, Angus professed no surprise at his decision to retire.

“I think once we saw how much of an active political player Mr. Wernick was in the SNC scandal, it became impossible for him to carry on his job, which is to have the trust of all parliamentarians on key matters of policy,” he said outside the Commons.

Angus also said Wernick should have “known better” in the way he presented himself before the justice committee, suggesting he was combative, evasive and partisan.

MPs on the committee were taken aback when he prefaced his initial testimony with a diatribe about the deteriorating tenor of political discourse, with incitements to violence that he said made him fear someone will be assassinated during the coming election campaign. He cited the example of a Conservative senator who’d urged truckers in a pipeline protest on Parliament Hill to “roll over every Liberal” in the country.

Wernick engaged in a number of testy exchanges with opposition MPs. In a second appearance, he suggested profane messages he received through the social media “vomitorium” after his first appearance amounted to witness intimidation.

The Liberal-dominated committee is to meet Tuesday to consider opposition demands to recall Wilson-Raybould. She has already testified for nearly four hours but has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation a month later.

But the five Liberals on the justice committee—Edmonton’s Randy Boissonault, Toronto-area MPs Iqra Khalid and Ali Ehassi, B.C.’s Ron McKinnon and Nova Scotia’s Colin Fraser—tipped their hand in an open letter to their fellow Liberal who chairs it, Anthony Housefather.

“The committee has heard from principal witnesses in this matter,” their joint letter says, including Wernick, Wilson-Raybould, and Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts. They’ve met for 13 hours of testimony over 11 meetings, it says, and “Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, perspectives and relevant legal principles … As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

McLellan’s work and a separate investigation by the federal ethics commissioner will complete the picture, the letter says.

In the Commons, Trudeau himself likewise argued that the committee has been meeting for five weeks and has heard “all perspectives.” He suggested further inquiry should be left to the federal ethics commissioner.

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

Badiei comes from an engineering background, having started her career at BC Hydro working on grid-scale transmission planning.

She then spent a couple of years with a power company in California before jumping into a string of humanitarian positions — in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Philippines with Doctors Without Borders; in Afghanistan working to treat municipal water with the Red Cross; and in Jerusalem as an energy specialist with the World Bank.

Several Liberal MPs were on hand at Port Moody’s Old Orchard Hall to welcome Badiei’s nomination, including Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam MP Ron McKinnon, Burnaby North-Seymour MP Terry Beech, and Harjit Sajjan, Minister of National Defence and MP for Vancouver South.

While the Conservative Party has yet to choose its candidate for the Port Moody-Coquitlam race, on Friday, Coquitlam City Coun. Bonita Zarrillo launched her bid to represent the NDP in this year’s election.

Zarrillo will be competing against Sean Lee, who currently works as communications director of the electoral district’s executive. Both have less than three weeks to prepare for the NDP nomination scheduled on March 31.

The federal riding of Port Moody–Coquitlam was left wide open when NDP MP Fin Donnelly — who has held the seat for nearly a decade — announced in December he would not be running for re-election.

Instead, Morneau has focused on lowering the net debt-to-GDP ratio — a measure of how burdensome the ...","OTTAWA — The final budget of the Trudeau government’s mandate will scatter billions in fresh spending — on everything from pharmacare to retraining workers to first-time home buyers — as the Liberals commit to an electoral fight that pits their deficit-spending vision versus the Conservatives’ balanced-books approach.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s budget Tuesday resembled Liberal economic plans that preceded it: the government will exhaust a big windfall, run near-term deficits of about $20 billion and offer no timeline to return to balance.

The document tabled in the Commons showed that a stronger economy last year will put an extra $27.8 billion into the federal treasury over the next six years, compared to government predictions in its November economic update.

With seven months to go before the election, Morneau’s plan will spread around $22.8 billion of that additional cash. The government also said it’s booked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Out of all this new spending, most of it will be aimed at Canadians’ pocketbooks.

Funding for some of Tuesday’s commitments will only start kicking in after October’s election, giving voters the chance to weigh in on the budget’s contents at the ballot box.

The Liberals’ plan places them in stark contrast with the Opposition Conservatives, who have called on the government to rein in spending.

“The opposition would like to see us make cuts very rapidly — their idea is balance the budget at any cost,” Morneau told a news conference Tuesday after being asked about his deficits.

“Well, if we had taken that approach in 2015 we would not be where we are today with a better outcome for middle-class Canadians. We’d be in a more difficult spot.”

The measures in Morneau’s fiscal blueprint cover a lot of territory, with a clear focus on individuals — particularly younger adults — as opposed to businesses. The plan includes:

— $4.6 billion over five years to help more Canadians afford and access skills training to keep up with the rapidly evolving workforce

— $4.5 billion over five years to improve living conditions for Indigenous Peoples

— $1.8 billion over four years to enhance the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors

— $885 million over five years to make homes more affordable for first-time buyers

— $500 million per year, starting in 2022-23, to help cover the cost of drugs for rare diseases.

The government will make several large, one-time investments for 2018-19, including $2.2 billion worth of new infrastructure funding and $1 billion towards improving energy efficiency.

The budget also pledges up to $3.9 billion for supply-managed dairy, egg and poultry farmers affected by recent trade deals with the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

Even with these investments, Ottawa’s fiscal track promises to be a key issue on the campaign trail.

The annual deficit projections in Tuesday’s budget — which reach as high as $19.8 billion — are less than one percentage point of Canada’s gross domestic product, a modest level when compared internationally.

Still, the Liberals will be forced to explain themselves repeatedly until election day.

They came to power in 2015 on a platform that vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019.

After the 2015 election, the Trudeau government abandoned the promise, arguing more investments were needed to lift Canada’s long-term economic growth. Instead, Morneau has focused on lowering the net debt-to-GDP ratio — a measure of how burdensome the national debt is — each year even as the actual debt has increased.

The Conservatives have attacked the Liberals for breaking their deficit promise and have demanded Morneau map out a return to balanced books. They’ve accused the government of borrowing today on the backs of future generations.

Morneau introduced his blueprint Tuesday just before 4 p.m. ET, but his customary budget speech to the House of Commons was delayed an hour by a series of procedural manoeuvres by the Conservatives.

When Morneau finally started speaking, Tory MPs drowned out most of his address by stomping and shouting.

The Tories were protesting the Liberal-dominated justice committee’s decision earlier Tuesday to pull the plug on its probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s and his senior officials have faced allegations of judicial interference.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told reporters that, given the SNC-Lavalin scandal, his MPs refused to stand by and watch Morneau table a budget as though it were business as usual.

On the new spending in the budget, Scheer warned that Canadians will have to pay for it through higher taxes if Trudeau is re-elected.

“Conservatives will fight to bring fiscal responsibility back to this country,” he said.

Leaders in corporate Canada and some economists have also criticized the Liberal deficits, especially since they’ve come during good economic times when many believe governments should be focused on paying off debt.

A big question is what will become of the Liberal spending plan — and how big the shortfalls will grow — when Canada is hit by the next economic downturn.

The economy has had a good run, but experts say it’s debatable how much of Canada’s recent economic performance has come from Liberal policies and how much has been a result of the stronger U.S. and global economies.

New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh said the budget didn’t go far enough on universal pharmacare, skills training and pensions.

He also questioned the budget’s measure to allow people to use a larger share — $35,000 instead of $25,000 — of their registered retirement savings plans to buy their first home.

“How many people have enough in their RRSP as a first-time home buyer to make that in any way meaningful?” Singh asked. “This is a budget that gives crumbs to Canadians when the government has already given the entire pie to the wealthiest.”

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 2019 BUDGET

OTTAWA — Highlights from the federal Liberal budget tabled Tuesday by Finance Minister Bill Morneau:

— $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade skills and acquire new ones while keeping their jobs. The benefit includes a $250-a-year tax credit to pay for training programs and access to employment insurance to cover living expenses for up to four weeks away from work.

— $1.18 billion over five years to toughen border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications.

— Measures to make housing more affordable, especially for first-time buyers, by letting them borrow $35,000 from RRSPs (up from $25,000) and having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

— A federal deficit of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ forecast again includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but not quite as quickly as anticipated last year. By 2023-2024, the projected federal deficit is $11.4 billion.

— $3.9 billion for farmers in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with Europe and a bloc of Pacific Rim countries.

— $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects, through a one-time boost to the amount distributed through the federal gas-tax transfer.

— $1.2 billion over three years to enhance social services for Indigenous families and children, the main element in a package of spending aimed at Indigenous Peoples.

— Lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, from the current prime-plus-2.5-percentage-points.

— Creating a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize the evaluations of the effectiveness and efficiency of new drugs and buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

— $500 million a year, starting in 2022, to subsidize the costs of drugs for rare diseases, whose high costs are distributed among very few patients.

— $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles (with a maximum purchase price of $45,000).

— $950 million for municipal governments to refit their own buildings for energy efficiency and to provide their own subsidy programs for private homeowners to do the same.

Conservative Party of Canada seats in the ...","David Anderson figures he’s put around three-quarters of a million kilometres on a succession of vehicles, and flown a couple million more, over his 19-year career in federal politics.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

Take a look at what the Liberals have in store here.

OTTAWA — Finance Minister Bill Morneau will release the Trudeau government's final budget of its mandate Tuesday, just seven months before the next federal election.

Here are some things to watch for:

1) A boost to skills training

The government says it wants to help workers adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the modern workforce. The budget is expected to announce measures to help Canadians cover their bills if they choose to head back to school to upgrade their skills or to change careers. Morneau has also said he wants to make sure workers have dedicated time off so they can get that skills training. As part of the package, the Liberals plan to create a lifelong savings account for adults after drawing inspiration from a similar program launched a few years ago in Singapore, said a government source, who was not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is not yet released. The program is expected to share traits with Canada's registered education savings plan (RESP), but be aimed at mid-career adults rather than youth. In late 2017, Morneau's council of economic advisers recommended such a program, which the group called the ""Canada Lifelong Learning Fund.""

2) Helping more millennials buy homes

The budget will include plans to help more first-time buyers enter the housing market, changes that will arrive at a time of out-of-reach real estate prices in some parts of the country. Morneau has said he's particularly focused on helping millennials, a generation of people who are now in their mid-20s to late 30s. His budget will make home-buying more affordable with a series of changes affecting housing supply, demand and regulation, a government source said.

3) (Early) steps toward national pharmacare

The Liberals also plan to move toward their two main goals on pharmacare: keeping costs down and ensuring better coverage for everyone. Earlier this month, an advisory panel assembled by Ottawa released an interim report that recommended the federal government create a new agency to oversee the rollout of a national drug plan, the first part of a much broader pharmacare program. The panel, led by former Ontario health minister Eric Hoskins, said the federal government should also develop a national list of drugs to ensure consistent coverage across the country. It called for funding to gather better data on prescription medications. Some have high hopes Tuesday's budget will include an extensive pharmacare component, but a government source said any firm commitments won't go much beyond the interim report's recommendations.

Watch: Morneau speaks about upcoming budget

4) On or off the fiscal track?

In November, Morneau predicted annual deficits of $18.1 billion in 2018-19, $19.6 billion in 2019-20 and $18.1 billion in 2020-21. After 2020-21, the annual shortfalls were expected to shrink each year, reaching $11.4 billion in 2023-24. Ottawa's fiscal track promises to be a key issue in the October election campaign — with Liberals calling for investments to lift long-term growth and the Opposition Conservatives demanding balanced books to ensure future generations aren't stuck with the tab.

5) Lifeline for the news industry

The Trudeau government is due to deliver an update to its plan to support the ailing journalism industry. Last fall, it announced new tax credits and incentives worth $595 million over the next five years. Ottawa said it would create an independent panel of experts from the journalism community to seek advice on the measures and, in particular, define which outlets will be eligible for a refundable tax credit on labour costs. But it has yet to assemble the panel, which has raised concerns in the news industry that the support is taking too long to materialize. A spokesman for Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said last week that the budget will lay out details of the measures announced in the fall.",Federal Budget 2019: 5 Things To Watch For In The Liberals' Last Fiscal Plan Before The Election,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/19/budget-2019-5-things_a_23695514/
48,Business,2019-03-19T21:01:00.0000000Z,While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China ... Political coalitions are notoriously fragile and the coalition that emerged in the wake of the last federal election in support of carbon pricing is no exception. The 2018 election of Doug Ford ...,"At the historic climate talks in Paris in 2015, countries agreed that large-scale transformation is required to avoid the worst effects of global temperature rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last year added more urgency to this message — countries have little more than a decade to keep global warming below 1.5°C.

Carbon pricing is globally recognized as a vital tool to reduce carbon emissions. While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China, Argentina and South Africa in implementing some form of carbon pricing mechanism in 2019, Canada’s federalist system poses a unique set of challenges.

Last month the Ontario government released the details of its carbon pricing plan for big emitters, which looks quite similar to the federal emissions trading system the province adamantly opposes. This was the most recent development from a provincial coalition — made up of the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick — opposed to the federal carbon pricing plan.

While provincial governments have employed a range of strategies to oppose the federal plan, influential industry players like the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have openly supported the federal carbon pricing system. Canadians are now spectators to a surprising matchup, with the federal government and a growing number of industry players facing off against defecting provinces.

It is difficult to imagine a scenario where Canada can meet its Paris Agreement target of reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 without an ambitious and effective carbon pricing mechanism. So how can we make sense of these two seemingly contradictory developments — provincial opposition yet (conditional) industry support for carbon pricing — and how will they affect the future of Canada’s price on carbon?

The federal carbon pollution pricing system became law last summer. The plan consists of two ‘backstops’: a carbon levy and a trading system for large emitters. The carbon levy (also known as a fuel charge) will apply to fossil fuel producers or distributors, starting at $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (C02e). This comes into effect in April 2019 for Saskatchewan, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick.

The second part of the federal plan — which came into effect on January 1 — is the trading system designed for large industrial emitters (those that emit 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year), known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). In this system, the government sets an emissions threshold for each sector; companies that emit below their annual limit receive credits and those that exceed the limit must either buy credits from other companies or pay the tax (which also starts at $20 per tonne). The OBPS came into effect in January for industry in Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and partially in Saskatchewan.

A price on carbon is not a silver bullet for Canada’s emissions reductions, nor was it intended to be. Although Canada is slipping further behind on its Paris targets, the federal carbon pricing system will still significantly reduce emissions. Last fall the government estimated that — once the planned provincial and territorial systems take effect and the federal backstop is applied — the system could cut carbon pollution across Canada by 50 to 60 million tonnes in 2022. According to the latest federal projections, with the carbon pricing backstop and other proposed measures, Canada will fall short of its 2030 target by 79 millions tonnes. Without these measures the gap increases to 164 million tonnes.

Applying the federal backstop will be no easy feat. The Ontario and Saskatchewan governments have launched legal cases against the federal government. The first legal case against the federal plan is already underway in Saskatchewan, with Ontario and New Brunswick intervening in favour of Saskatchewan (and British Columbia intervening in favour of the federal government). If the newly elected premier of New Brunswick, Blaine Higgs, makes good on his promise, and if Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party wins the Alberta spring provincial election, they could also file court cases. While Manitoba has yet to take legal action, Premier Brian Pallister unexpectedly announced last October that the government would abandon a planned carbon tax. Together these politicians are forming a new alliance against carbon pricing. Despite some variations in their positions — like Kenney’s indication that he would support the price for heavy emitters but reject the fuel charge — they are rallying together and supporting each other’s legal cases.",Redrawing the battle lines in the fight over Canada’s price on carbon,opencanada.org,https://www.opencanada.org/features/redrawing-the-battle-lines-in-the-fight-over-canadas-price-on-carbon/

The budget also indicates more money could be ...","OTTAWA — The Trudeau government is promising billions of dollars to compensate dairy, egg and poultry farmers hurt by Canada's recent free-trade agreements — industries concentrated in vote-rich Quebec and Ontario.

The $3.65 billion the government is setting aside includes $2.15 billion to help farmers who lose income because of trade deals with Europe and countries on the Pacific Rim, both of which make it easier for foreign egg, dairy and poultry producers to enter the Canadian market.

article continues below

That is in addition to a $250-million, five-year fund established in 2016 to compensate dairy farmers for the European Union deal.

The budget earmarks $1.5 billion for farmers who lose money when they sell their production rights in the supply-management system, which limits egg, poultry and dairy production in Canada. To gain the right to sell supply-managed products, farmers have to buy ""quota,"" often from existing producers who want to leave the industry.

The system also limits foreign products by slapping steep tariffs on imports beyond a certain level, which raises their price at the grocery store and makes them less attractive to consumers. Allowing more foreign-produced food into the Canadian market will increase competition for products from Canadian farmers.

""To ensure that Canada's dairy, poultry and egg farmers can continue to provide Canadians with high-quality products in a world of freer trade, we will make available an income protection program for supply-managed farmers, along with a measure to protect the value of quota investments these farmers have already made,"" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in his prepared budget speech.

The budget does not provide details on how or when the money will be distributed to farmers and producers, who have long railed against any move that would expand foreign involvement in those sectors.

But the government appears to be hoping the promise of compensation will provide a salve to supply-managed farmers, many of whom are clumped in key ridings in Quebec and Ontario and angry that the deals have weakened their grip on the market.

That could prove important for the Liberals, who will likely need a strong showing in the two provinces in this year's federal election to have a hope of retaining power.

The budget also indicates more money could be forthcoming as the government works with industry ""to address the impacts on processing, as well as potential future impacts of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement.""

“The federal government recognizes the impact of trade agreements on our sector and is following through on its commitment to support our domestic dairy industry,” said Pierre Lampron, president of the board of directors for the Dairy Farmers of Canada.

""We also welcome the government’s commitment to continue the dialogue on the future impact of CUSMA on our sector.""

The North American deal, which will succeed NAFTA, has yet to be ratified and come into effect. That deal is the third free-trade agreement in which Canada agreed to open its supply-managed sectors, which emerged last year as a favourite target of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly the dairy sector.

Supply management has long been hotly debated in Canada.

Proponents say the system keeps the market from getting saturated, which keeps prices stable and ensures steady incomes for farmers while protecting food safety, ensuring higher-quality products and eliminating the need for direct subsidies.

Critics say it drives up the cost of dairy, eggs and chicken for consumers, which has a disproportionate impact on low-income families. The system has been a frequent target in — and barrier to — past free-trade negotiations.

Successive federal governments for decades nonetheless resisted opening Canada to more tariff-free imports from other countries, in part because of the political implications.

But when Stephen Harper was prime minister, the Conservatives opened the door to change when they agreed to ease restrictions on European cheese imports through the Canada-European Union trade deal, which was signed and came into force under the Trudeau Liberals.

Ottawa then agreed, in the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, to give participants more access to Canada's dairy, egg and poultry markets.","Liberals promise billions for dairy, chicken farmers affected by trade deals",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/liberals-promise-billions-for-dairy-chicken-farmers-affected-by-trade-deals-1.23668230

Ephestion's citizenship is dependant on whether he passes the test, but Smith said she doesn't expect he'll have any problems with that or with his application to become a Liberal leadership candidate.

""We're very confident he's going to pass his test, and he will be a citizen on the 17th.""

Smith said Ephestion has resigned as director of Nazareth House, a shelter in Moncton, so he can devote his time to his leadership campaign.

But the leadership race rules published by the Liberal Party on Feb. 7 require that candidates ""be eligible for election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in accordance with the Elections Act."" This means candidates must be citizens.

Ephestion could be disqualified from the Liberal leadership race because he is not yet a citizen. He has permanent resident status in Canada and applied for citizenship in September.

Keiller Zed, the executive director of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, said he wouldn't be able to comment specifically on Ephestion's application until it had gone through a vetting process.

The steering committee has five business days from the receipt of an application to review and approve or reject it.

Zed was able to confirm the association has received one candidate application already and expects to receive another one shortly.

He would not say who had already submitted forms, but a post to Ephestion's Facebook page from March 15 said his application was submitted that day, meaning the committee would have until this Friday to approve or reject it — provided it's properly completed.",Liberal leadership candidate gets date for citizenship test,Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/liberal-leadership-candidate-gets-date-210136753.html

Philpott addressed the group at the beginning of the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled and was described by people in the room as ""rough"" and ""uncomfortable.""

Philpott — widely considered to be one of the most competent and respected ministers in the Trudeau government — resigned from the Liberal cabinet March 4, saying in a public statement that she had lost confidence in how the Trudeau government was handling the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Today's meeting of the Ontario regional caucus was the first since Philpott resigned. She did not attend today's meeting of the national Liberal caucus.

She remains a member of the caucus and has said she intends to seek re-election as the Liberal candidate in her Markham-Stouffville riding.

Today, some of her fellow Liberal MPs reminded her that others in the caucus had made compromises on sensitive issues such as medical assistance in dying — one of the key pieces of legislation Philpott fronted as health minister, along with then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking a Deferred Prosecution Agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Wilson-Raybould also remains in the Liberal caucus and says she will run in the fall campaign under the party's banner.

Trudeau touts 'strong team'

As caucus tensions played out behind closed doors today, Trudeau insisted the Liberals are a ""strong team"" bound by a collective focus on growing the economy for the middle class, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and promoting gender equality.

""As the two members in question have indicated, they intend to run as Liberals in the next election,"" he said during an event in Orleans, Ont., where he was promoting the housing affordability measures in Tuesday's budget. ""We will continue to work together and make sure that we're delivering tangibly for Canadians the way we did with this most recent budget.""

In the statement announcing her resignation from cabinet, Philpott said that after ""serious reflection"" on the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks, she concluded she must quit.

""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations,"" she said.

""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government’s chances of re-election in a vote scheduled for October this year. Polls have shown that Trudeau’s Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The prime minister told reporters that parliamentarian Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who has publicly backed Wilson-Raybould several times and earlier this month attacked Trudeau on Twitter, had left the Liberal parliamentary caucus.

“I want to thank her for her service to the Liberal Party and to her constituents and wish her the best,” Trudeau said in brief remarks.

Caesar-Chavannes, who represents a parliamentary constituency in the province of Ontario, had already announced she would not run again in this October’s federal election.

Although her departure has little immediate political effect - the Liberals still have a majority in the House of Commons - it underlines the staying power of an affair that has already cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy.

It is also awkward for a prime minister who came to power in late 2015 promising to boost the role of women in politics.

The office of Caesar-Chavannes was not immediately available for comment.

The legislator told the Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Trudeau had shouted at her after she called him to say she would not contest her seat in this year’s election.","In fresh blow to Canada PM Trudeau, lawmaker quits his caucus",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1R12KA-OCADN

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive.

""I understand that there's a lot of people that supported me that were disappointed in what I did, doing the interview that I did,"" she said. ""I think that it's important to understand that while I support the values and the principles of the Liberal party, that it might be good, since that message did go out, that I sit as an Independent for the rest of the term that I'm here.""

Caesar-Chavannes made headlines in February when she jumped to the defence of Jody Wilson-Raybould over the SNC-Lavalin affair. The MP tweeted that Wilson-Raybould was ""fierce, smart, and unapologetic"" after unnamed Liberal insiders made unflattering comments about the former attorney general in the media.

""When women speak up and out, they are always going to be labelled. Go ahead. Label away. We are not going anywhere,"" she said at the time.

When Jane Philpott stepped down as Treasury Board president weeks ago, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau has handled the controversy, Caesar-Chavannes threw her support behind the departing minister.

""When you add women, please do not expect the status quo,"" she tweeted. ""Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott remain members of the Liberal caucus and plan to run again under the party banner.

When she announced that she would not seek re-election, Caesar-Chavannes said the decision was not related to the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

❤️ When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised. Thank you @janephilpott for articulating this beautifully. +1 https://t.co/hyVSB4MREk — MP Celina 🇨🇦 (@MPCelina) March 4, 2019

""Over the course of the last three and a half years ... I had the opportunity to work with some fantastic colleagues, debate policy, put forward ideas and shape tremendous pieces of legislation that will have a real and positive impact on families across the country,"" Caesar-Chavannes wrote in a statement at the time.

""It is an honour I never took for granted, and will not soon forget. That is why this announcement is a tremendously difficult one for me to make.""

The MP previously served as a parliamentary secretary to both the prime minister and international development minister.

Vocal on mental health, race issues

In 2016, Caesar-Chavannes revealed that she struggles with depression.

""Owning my depression is my therapy. Talking about it, in my opinion, gives others permission to talk about mental health as well,"" she wrote in a blog for HuffPost Canada.

As one of the few black MPs in the House, Caesar-Chavannes has also been vocal on issues of race, including ""microaggressions"" she has faced on Parliament Hill.

In 2017, the MP wore ""dope"" braids to deliver a speech in the Commons denouncing body shaming. In remarks that went viral, Caesar-Chavannes said she was speaking out for ""young girls and women who look like me"" and those who do not.

Watch:

""I want them to know that their braids, their dreads, their super-curly afro puffs, their weaves, their hijabs, and their headscarves, and all other variety of hairstyles, belong in schools, in the workplace, in the boardroom and yes, even here on Parliament Hill,"" she said.

Caesar-Chavannes clashed with former Tory MP Maxime Bernier, now leader of the People's Party of Canada, on social media last year. They had heated exchanges after Bernier criticized the Liberal government's decision to fund programs designed for Canadians with minority backgrounds.

Caesar-Chavannes apologized after telling Bernier to ""check your privilege and be quiet.""

Months later, Bernier accused Caesar-Chavannes on Twitter of thinking ""the world revolves around (her) skin colour.""

She fired back by saying that, unlike Bernier, she can focus on matters of public policy ""while also shifting the status quo and increasing awareness.""

Celina Caesar-Chavannes has informed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that she's leaving the federal Liberal caucus and will sit as an independent MP.

The Whitby, Ont., MP has been a vocal supporter of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two cabinet ministers who resigned over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an interview with the Globe and Mail last week, she also accused Trudeau of yelling at her angrily when she informed him that she would not be seeking re-election this fall — an accusation the Prime Minister's Office has denied.

In a tweet Wednesday, Caesar-Chavannes said that interview ""has had unintended effects on those I care about. Although that was not the intention, it was the consequence, and I am sorry. I no longer want to distract from the great work my caucus colleagues are doing. Love and hugs, C.""

But Conservatives pounced on the defection, arguing that Caesar-Chavannes's exit, added to the departures of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from cabinet, prove that Trudeau is a ""fake feminist.""

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen said the ""good old boys"" in the Prime Minister's Office wanted Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and when she refused, ""she was promptly fired and silenced.""

""The prime minister is really good at yelling and screaming at women, as the member from Whitby knows, and he's also a very good actor. But, Mr. Speaker, he's a fake feminist,"" Bergen told the House of Commons.

Trudeau said he'll take no lessons on feminism from Conservatives who ""still want to challenge a woman's right to choose"" to have an abortion.

Caesar-Chavannes, first elected in 2015, has been a relatively high-profile backbencher, primarily as an advocate for the rights of black Canadians. She's gotten into several Twitter wars with Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada, who once accused her of thinking ""the world revolves around your skin colour."" On another occasion, she apologized to Bernier after telling him to ""check your privilege and be quiet"" when he questioned funding for minority groups.

She also made news in 2016 when she openly talked about her battle with depression.

At the time, Caesar-Chavannes, who was initially named parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, praised Trudeau's understanding of mental illness but she has since soured on his leadership.

Throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga, she has used social media to send messages of solidarity — accompanied by a clenched-fist emoji — to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

In January, she used a speech at Parliament's annual dinner tribute to Scottish poet Robbie Burns to take a swipe at Trudeau for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a small cabinet shuffle earlier that month, to be replaced by Montreal MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet a few weeks later, although both she and Philpott, who resigned subsequently from cabinet, remain members of the Liberal caucus.",Liberal MP quits caucus,Castanet,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/252012/Liberal-MP-quits-caucus

In the wake of legalization, however, BC risks losing its foothold. The province is home to 14% of Canada’s population and over half of all medically-licensed producers populate the west coast.

Legalization has ushered in a new era of cultivation that is alienating the small producers who made Canadian cannabis famous in the first place.

“Craft cannabis is just getting started in the federal legal landscape but it’s behind,” said David Hurford, who worked for the federal Health Minister when Canada legalized cannabis and started regulating industrial hemp production and natural health products.

After years of working in policy for the government, Hurford became active within the Liberal Party of Canada as BC policy chair when the Party approved the legalization of cannabis in 2013. Until April 2018 he was Policy Chair for the Liberal Party of Canada.

More recently, Hurford is supporting the establishment of a BC Small Cannabis Producer and Processor Co-op with Grow Tech Labs and other stakeholder groups across BC.

“It’s very important that the small producers are brought in to the legal market,” said Hurford. “Many of them have been experts in their field, they are a significant asset to the industry and the country in terms of economic opportunity.”

Grow Tech Labs was founded in October 2018 as a Vancouver-based cannabis business accelerator that is backed by Victory Square Technologies. Hurford is one of GTL’s mentors, focusing on government relations.

“The Grow Tech mission is to accelerate the pace at which small producers and processors enter the legal marketplace,” said Grow Tech Labs CEO Barinder Rasode, in a press release.

There are thousands of small cannabis producers in BC who are designated by Health Canada to produce medical cannabis.

“BC has the most to gain by ensuring small producers and processors are active participants in Canada’s cannabis economy,” said Rasode. “BC co-op’s have demonstrated this business model can deliver economic prosperity for a broad range of citizens and establish a proven legal framework to govern collective decision-making in this rapidly evolving sector.”

BC has a vibrant co-operative movement, with 700 co-op businesses, two million members, and almost $50 billion in assets.

Hurford noted a number of benefits to joining a co-op.

“Pooling resources could mean getting a better price for their product; a group can negotiate a good price for them domestically and internationally as well. In British Columbia’s case, this is a major international product that we have here. People around the world want BC bud. When they think of BC cannabis, they are thinking about the small producer.”

“The other benefit is to share best practices, particularly around environmental stewardship of land,” said Hurford. “There is an opportunity to create a culture around diversity, equality, environmental sustainability, and regeneration.

“For us, it’s about BC maintaining that status and keeping small producers in the game is a key part of that.”

Hurford noted that despite BC’s robust pool of talent, transitioning to the legal market has not been made easy.

“Health Canada has not proactively engaged with small producers and given them a pathway to flip,” said Hurford, who hopes Health Canada will recognize these skilled cultivators as a resource.

“We’re having a supply shortage right now. We don’t have enough cannabis to serve the population. The black market is still thriving. I think especially with the supply shortage, many are quite disappointed that the federal government has not done more to reach these people and bring them into the process.”

One of the challenges is the zoning requirements. Municipal approval is another requirement under the new legalization regime.

“This is an area where the co-op can help. It can facilitate government relations with small producers.”

The co-op can also create a collective voice and help the ongoing process of refining regulations based on industry needs. For example, Hurford said almost everyone feels the current cap on growing space for micro cultivators is too restrictive and limits profitability.

“A co-op can help advocate to improve those regulations to make sure small producers are thriving,” said Hurford.

“The co-op is there to help make the case for transitioning to the legal market. This is a group of people that can be trusted, they want to comply with regulations. They are not all criminals or connected to organized crime. They are law-abiding, respectful people just trying to make an honest living for their family and contribute to their local economy.”

Grow Tech is sponsoring a series of regional meetings across the province in February and March. The goal is to invite feedback on services the co-op could provide members along with a proposed mission, goals and governance structure. The results of the consultation will guide a formal process to incorporate the co-op this spring under BC’s legislation.",Cannabis co-op wants BC Bud at the forefront of Canada’s new industry,Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/grow/cannabis-co-op-canada-emerging-industry-2019

James Cullingham is a documentary ...,"By James Cullingham

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has brushed aside calls from former cabinet minister Jane Philpott to waive all cabinet and solicitor general privileges to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak freely about the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Ms. Philpott told Maclean’s magazine in an interview published on Thursday that Canadians need to know “the whole story” of what she called an “attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial” of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Philpott resigned earlier this month as President of the Treasury Board, citing a lack of confidence in the way the Prime Minister handled the SNC-Lavalin matter.

The political controversy has resulted in the resignations of four high-profile members of the Trudeau government and maneuvers by the opposition to disrupt Parliament in protest of a decision by the Liberal-dominated justice committee to shut down its inquiry into the matter.

Conservative MPs forced marathon votes on spending estimates Wednesday night that are expected to take up most of Thursday and force the cancellation of the Commons Question Period.

In testimony before the Commons justice committee last month, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top aides including the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, to grant a deferred prosecution agreement to the Montreal engineering and construction company.

The B.C. Liberal MP has said she wanted to return for a second round of testimony to explain what transpired between when she was moved out of the justice portfolio in early January and her resignation from cabinet on Feb. 11.

She has asked Prime Minister to give her another waiver from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to talk about conversations with Mr. Trudeau that led to her resignation from cabinet.

“If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories,” Ms. Philpott said. “My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole truth.”

At an event in Mississauga, Mr. Trudeau told reporters he already granted an unprecedented waiver to Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she could provide testimony about the political pressure she said was exerted between September and December 2018 to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

Story continues below advertisement

“The issue was pressure around SNC-Lavalin while she was attorney-general and she got to speak fully to do that,” Mr. Trudeau said in dismissing requests he allow her to speak about the period after she was shuffled out of Justice.

This week, the government has tried to shift the political focus from the SNC-Lavalin affair to the budget. The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the former attorney general to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout from The Globe report, Mr. Trudeau has lost the two ministers as well as his principal secretary, Gerald Butts. On Monday, Mr. Wernick retired as Canada’s top bureaucratic saying he has lost the “trust and respect"" of the opposition parties over his role in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

On Tuesday, Liberal MPs on the Justice committee shut down hearings on the SNC-Lavalin matter, preventing Ms. Wilson-Raybould from returning to testify.

Liberal MPs are also expected to use their majority on the House ethics committees on Thursday to block an attempt by Conservative and NDP members to mount an inquiry and have Ms. Wilson-Raybould testify.

SNC-Lavalin never claimed jobs were at risk, CEO Neil Bruce says

In the Maclean’s interview, Ms. Philpott said she is also keen to have cabinet privileges waived so she could talk about a Dec. 6 meeting with the Prime Minister when they discussed his plans to shuffle Ms. Wilson-Raybould out of the post of justice minister and attorney-general.

“I spoke to the Prime Minister on January the 6th about SNC-Lavalin’s desire to have a DPA [deferred prosecution agreement],” she said. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister. … Why would I have felt that there was a reason why the former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled.”

Mr. Trudeau had a different interpretation of that meeting, saying it was about Ms. Philpott’s move from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board President and his plan to have Ms. Wilson-Raybould take over her portfolio.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her, ‘no it was not,’ ” he said. “She then mentioned it may be a challenge for Jody-Wilson Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services.”

Mr. Trudeau said he asked Ms. Philpott “for her help, and she gladly offered"" to help convince Ms. Wilson-Raybould to take the position. A former B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ms. Wilson-Raybould turned down the job because she did not want to oversee the Indian Act.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould was then shuffled to Veteran Affairs on Jan. 14, which she believed was related to her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

Ms. Philpott said Ms. Wilson-Raybould was subjected to “bullying or harassment” from the Prime Minister’s Office to overrule federal prosecutors and negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

“The former AG didn’t want to override that, and she had her finger in the dike and said no repeatedly,"" Ms. Philpott said.

In the aftermath of Ms. Philpott’s interview, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh renewed calls on Thursday for a judicial inquiry.

""Give us the independence of a judge that is not limited by a Liberal-dominated committee, where a judge has the independence to ask all witnesses all the questions necessary so Canadians can learn the truth,” he said. “If the Prime Minister was co-operative, the public inquiry would not take very long.

By David Ljunggren and Fergal Smith

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained under pressure over a corruption scandal on Wednesday as a legislator quit his party's caucus and a pre-election budget aimed at swaying key voters appeared to offer too little to stem the tide of negative news.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada's 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau's embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau's Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday's budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

""It's just too broad,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. ""They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.""

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was ""a political rather than an economic decision,"" he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied ""that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.""

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau's resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals' best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau's budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.

At the time, Caesar-Chavannes, who was initially named parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, praised Trudeau’s understanding of mental illness but she has since soured on his leadership.

Throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga, she has used social media to send messages of solidarity — accompanied by a clenched-fist emoji — to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

In January, she used a speech at Parliament’s annual dinner tribute to Scottish poet Robbie Burns to take a swipe at Trudeau for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a small cabinet shuffle earlier that month, to be replaced by Montreal MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet a few weeks later.

Had Burns been an MP, Caesar-Chavannes said, Wilson-Raybould would have been asked to remove him from Parliament.

“If she didn’t succeed, she would have been fired. If she succeeded in removing Robbie Burns, she would have been fired. You can’t have an Indian doing that to the white man. Lametti can, you can’t. The lads are better at that sort of thing,” she said.","Celina Caesar-Chavannes quits Liberal caucus, will sit as an independent MP",Ottawa Citizen,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/celina-caesar-chavannes-quits-liberal-caucus-sits-as-independent-mp-2/wcm/e604392c-24d4-40eb-b8c7-9c5fc63847cb

“Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

Given the Liberals on the justice committee released those words about their ‘investigation’ into the five-alarm fire that is the SNC-Lavalin scandal on the very day that Michael Wernick was claimed as another of its victims—based largely on his serial immolation in front of their committee—we’re going to need a new word for “chutzpah”.

Justin Trudeau has now lost his top aide, two of his top ministers, and the country’s top bureaucrat because of SNC, and the Liberals are asking us to “arrive at a conclusion”?

What conclusion do they think anyone can draw from trying to shut down inquiries into this clusterf–k, other than ‘these people definitely have something to hide’?

It’s breathtaking.

So bravo, Liberal Party of Canada; congratulations on achieving in three years a level of cynicism and contempt for the electorate most governments only reach at the tail end of their third mandate. It’s about the only thing the Liberals have managed to deliver that’s under-budget and ahead of schedule.

Principled Liberals must look back at 2015 like it was some kind of fever dream. Trudeau’s Liberals were going to be pro-women, transparent, non-partisan, evidence-based, for the middle class, and free from the all-controlling grip of the PMO. Now it’s 2019 and they’re gleefully trading women, transparency and evidence in favour of special interests, all at the direction of an ultra-partisan PMO.

And before the ‘two wrongs make a right’ brigade pops up to spew their whataboutery: the Liberals were supposed to be better than the gang they replaced, not the same or worse.

Even worse, in this case the Liberals deployed their deep bag of dirty tricks in the service of a company that has done things like bribe hospital managers and foreign governments to get their custom.

Had this firm been headquartered in a place like Calgary, or in an industry Justin Trudeau doesn’t give a toss about—like oil and gas—would the government have let it face the music? This is about politics, not jobs. Full stop.

Indeed, the gang who were all for evidence-based policy a few years back took SNC’s wild claims of catastrophic job loss at more or less face value. The government certainly didn’t press the company hard, if at all. Even Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s High Priest of Facts, could only mumble something about Finance having the figures when asked. Had they bothered to look, Liberals would have found a long-term investment in SNC from the Caisse de dépôt and the resulting commitment to keep SNC HQ in Montreal for years on end. No, SNC said ‘jump’ and Trudeau went through the roof.

And when the whole sordid tale finally came to light in the Feb. 7 edition of The Globe and Mail the Liberals went full Nixon instead of full transparency. Instead of treating the issue of the independence of the criminal justice system seriously the Liberals have tried to downplay it or—worse—treat it as a difference of opinion, a position that is both morally and ethically bankrupt.

From calling the story false to slandering Wilson-Raybould off-the-record, to muzzling her, to circumscribing her ability to speak, to now shutting down the entire committee investigation, the Liberals have resisted transparency at every turn. And if you believe the Ethics Commissioner is going to get to the bottom of this, then you, my friend, qualify for membership in the Trudeau Chapter of the Useful Idiots Club.

Instead of simply believing Wilson-Raybould—or Jane Philpott, for that matter—the Prime Minister has brushed them off as having either poor memories or poor comprehension skills. They simply experienced the inappropriate pressure differently, Trudeau explained, a line he first trotted out last summer to mansplain away an old groping allegation, a route out he had denied to others in his caucus facing similar allegations.

Because Trudeau just doesn’t live by normal standards or rules. He doesn’t pal around with the middle class and those hoping to join them. He hangs out with the jet set, the people who can afford cash for access, with the Aga Khan on his island and the tech titans who are polarizing our societies. These are his people. Of course he listened when SNC came calling.

And as the vice began to grip, Trudeau’s instinct was to politicize the public service in his defense, trotting out Wernick to run interference by caterwauling about the threat of violence on our streets. It was the same trick Trudeau pulled with Daniel Jean during the India trip when a convicted Sikh terrorist was spotted in his entourage. And you thought Stephen Harper was toxic for the non-partisan public service?

What’s worse, nothing will now change Trudeau’s mind on SNC. The company will get its deal, no matter what the federal courts or OECD say. On SNC, the Liberals have become the practitioners of the democratic failure they so harshly condemned in 2015.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

65,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"In an emailed response, the Liberal Party said it returned the money and improved its donation acceptance procedures. The Conservative Party of Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dogwood, a B.C. environmental organization ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

67,Business,2019-03-20T20:51:00.0000000Z,Canada’s next budget will look very familiar ... for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted ...,"Canada’s next budget will look very familiar, with Justin Trudeau set to spend much of a revenue windfall and continued red ink in his government’s books.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.

Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.

There are different paths Conservatives can take. One is the path seeking to mine as much dissatisfaction and animus as possible by blindly opposing every Liberal policy from immigration to pipelines, carbon taxes and rebates, or defence and foreign policy.

The other is to offer Canadians a robust and positive conservatism, replete with fresh ideas, nation and economy-building proposals and clear and compelling priorities – none of which would weaken Conservative principles of “smarter as opposed to larger” government; fair as opposed to excessive taxation; and equality of opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.

The Century Initiative Foundation in Canada, a distinguished mix of business, academic, volunteer sector and representative individuals, has a series of proposals for how Canada can achieve a population of 100 million people by 2100. It is nation-building at its best. If we want more clout at trade and environmental negotiations, in international forums and with enhanced strategic and defence capacity that facilitates a more pronounced independence for Canada, these are ideas Conservatives should consider and find a way to offer.

Fresh concepts on how to reduce poverty without growing the bureaucracies that manage existing, poverty-preserving welfare programs, would also be welcome. There is no contradiction within mainstream Conservative or Canadian mindsets between humane and effective government and reducing inefficiencies and burgeoning administrative overheads. Replacing the bureaucracy of the Indian Act (unbecoming to Canada and disrespectful to First Nations), is a classic Conservative project based on building trust, shared revenues and genuine respect for First Nations. And it could be incorporated into an economic growth plan for Canada.

Nor is there any reason Canadian Conservatives need to avoid frank discussion on foreign and defence policy. While much of both policies are, for good reason, non-partisan in substance, there is room for Conservative innovation on procurement, an Arctic strategy, relations with China and other authoritarian partners, and doubling the size of our Navy and Air Force over a reasonable period of time. And, if carbon taxes, deemed by some Conservatives as the devil’s spawn, are not the answer, neither is not having a policy that does not curb consumption of fossil fuels. It is not in the country’s or party’s interest.

The lure of dog whistle politics (decrying asylum seekers arriving through non-official border entries and knowing this will attract the anti-immigration and anti-diversity vote; or declining to support statutory reform of the Senate, while hoping not to get caught campaigning for the “all partisan all the time” Senate of yore) may work for a moment in time. But the conservatism of anger, resentment, turning back the clock, ignoring legitimate constitutional and self-government rights of First Nations, have rarely, in Canadian politics, won elections.

The negative approach not only underestimates the Canadian voter but affords the incumbent government and other parties strategic and tactical options that a more positive and constructive Conservative approach might supercede.

Balanced budgets, rainy day funds, and debt reduction no longer are features of the Liberal brand. From a purely ...","Paul Martin, where have you gone?

In 2015, the deficit slayer appeared with Justin Trudeau on the campaign trail, lending instant credibility to the Liberal upstart’s economic policy.

Trudeau has repaid Martin for his support by frittering away the previous Liberal prime minister’s legacy for fiscal prudence.

Martin, as finance minister in Jean Chretien’s government, perfected the budgetary art of underpromising and overdelivering. He regularly found himself with revenue windfalls, all of which he used to erase a record deficit and reduce the debt. Frankly, the constant “surprises” got ridiculous after awhile, but the effort did have the effect of instilling confidence in Ottawa’s oversight of the economy.

Times have changed.

Bill Morneau, the former executive who has served as Trudeau’s finance minister since the Liberals unexpectedly won the last election, keeps finding himself with more money than he expected. His latest budget, released on March 19, includes additional revenue of about $30 billion through 2024, compared with October’s economic update.

Unlike Martin, Morneau’s habit is to spend the windfall — all of it — on initiatives that will play well with his party’s base. Balanced budgets, rainy day funds, and debt reduction no longer are features of the Liberal brand. From a purely economic perspective, the strategy could result in reduced poverty and narrower wealth gaps, which would have long-term societal benefits. The worry is that too little is being done to prepare for an economic downturn, but that appears to be a risk that the Trudeau government is willing to take, especially months before an election.

“The most important promise we made to Canadians is to invest in their future,” Morneau said at a press conference in Ottawa before he tabled his fourth budget. In the House of Commons, he congratulated himself for making these investments while moving the books back “towards” balance. The deficit will be about $20 billion in the fiscal year that ends a year from now, and about $10 billion in 2024, according to Morneau’s latest financial plan.

If the economy continues to roll, those deficits won’t be a problem; they amount to one per cent of gross domestic product or less, entirely manageable and low by international standards.

But there is reason to be wary about Canada’s economic prospects.

The budget assumes economic growth of about 1.8 per cent over the next five years, which is about as fast as the Bank of Canada reckons the economy can grow without causing inflation. That’s a reasonable outlook, but one that some forecasters will see as optimistic.

GDP barely grew in the fourth quarter, and the first quarter probably won’t be much better. The soft patch could be temporary, the result of an unusually large convergence of headwinds that converged over the second half of last year that have since begun to relent. The future of the North American Free Trade Agreement no longer is in doubt, for example. That should be good for investment, as executives will have one less thing to worry about.

But what if something else is going on?

Canada might already be in a recession, if only a shallow one, according to David Wolf, a former adviser at the Bank of Canada who now is a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Toronto. Household debt is about 174 per cent of disposable income, a record and one the highest levels in the world. The surprise in the fourth quarter was a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending, suggesting that all that debt could finally be weighing on domestic demand.

At the same time, national home prices declined in 2018 for the first time in records that date to 1990, according to Bloomberg News. A slump could cause the value of the currency to drop to record lows of around US$0.65, creating a new headwind, according to Wolf. The country’s economy remains uncompetitive, so there is little to offset weaker household spending. “There’s a good chance that those stars are going to be misaligned,” Wolf told Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this week.

Balance-sheet recessions tend to drag. The U.S. recovery from the financial crisis was weaker than anyone expected, and Japan still is digging out from under the debt that crashed its economy in the 1990s. Indebted households and companies are unable to help with the recovery because the owe so much to their creditors.

If Canada found itself in a downturn, the federal government alone would be in a position to do something about it, according to David Dodge, the former Bank of Canada governor and the deputy minister at Finance when Martin balanced the budget in the 1990s. The biggest provinces all spent heavily to help reverse the Great Recession. None of them have the fiscal room to do so now, especially Ontario, the country’s biggest provincial economy, Dodge and Richard Dion, a former economist at the central bank, said in a pre-budget report published by Bennet Jones, the Toronto-based law firm for which both now work as advisers.

“In his spring budget, the federal minister of finance should take no spending or tax actions which would further compromise a future government’s room to take the necessary discretionary action to support growth and public investment in the event of a major economic downturn, unless these actions are aimed directly and demonstrably at enhancing productivity and investment to promote the potential growth of the economy,” Dodge and Dion wrote.

Morneau pledged incentives to ensure all of rural Canada has a broadband connection by 2030 and promised about $2 billion over five years for new training initiatives. The rest of the windfall was used on initiatives such as pharmacare and enhanced pension benefits. Nice initiatives. Let’s hope a recession doesn’t wreck them.

The federal debt and deficit used to be massive and terrifying creatures, the pachyderm pair’s every movement obsessing politicians, pundits and voters. The verdict on a federal budget often came down to whether a finance minister was feeding the beast, or diminishing it.

But that was another country and another time. If you’re still tapping your feet to tunes about Ottawa’s “out-of-control spending,” and “exploding national debt,” you’re rockin’ to the oldies on a gramophone.

Yes, compared to the Harper years, the Trudeau government has slightly increased the size of government, as promised. Nevertheless, the budget deficit since 2015 has been consistently small enough to keep the debt level on a downward track. Ottawa’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the lowest in the G7, and falling. There is no fiscal crisis. Not even close.

So let’s move on to what matters in Budget 2019 – not the quantity of Ottawa’s spending and taxing, but its quality.

On Tuesday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau took advantage of a strong economy and booming tax revenues to spend the windfall, and fund several new initiatives. Are these about long-term economic benefits, or short-term political returns? Is Budget 2019 about investments, or giveaways?

The First-Time Home Buyer Incentive: Giving voters money to buy a home is always politically popular. That doesn’t make it economically logical. In a country where many housing markets are overheated, or were until recently, it’s hard to see a home-buying subsidy as anything other than counter-productive and self-defeating, and likely to push up home prices.

What’s more, the government is also allowing people to plunder – sorry, borrow from – their retirement savings, with the amount that can be pulled out of an RRSP to finance a home increasing from $25,000 to $35,000.

Investment or giveaway? Verdict: Giveaway. Big time.

The Canada Training Benefit: Think of it like an RRSP, but with the savings going to your own on-the-job training.

If you’re between 25 and 65 years old, and earning more than $10,000 and less than about $150,000 a year, you’ll get an annual $250 tax credit. The credit, which is earned each year up to a lifetime maximum of $5,000, can be used to cover up to half the cost of a course or program offered by a university, college or institution offering occupational training.

Just as the RRSP is a retirement savings program, the Canada Training Benefit is a savings program for adult education. What to study will be up to the individual.

Investment or giveaway? In theory, it’s a sound investment in upskilling the workforce. However, much of the money could end up spent on courses delivering little economic benefit, or subsidizing training that would have taken place anyhow. The devil will be in the details; a verdict could be years in coming.

Encouraging seniors to remain in the workforce: Low-income seniors have long received a monthly payment known as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS). To encourage working seniors with low incomes to keep working – while avoiding a rapid claw-back of GIS benefits if they do – the government will eliminate the claw-back from the first $5,000 of income and exempt half of the next $15,000.

That makes this effectively a targeted tax cut aimed at low-income, working seniors. It’s designed to give them an incentive to keep on working, boosting both the economy and their incomes. Verdict: Investment.

An extra $2.2-billion to municipalities in 2018-19: Feeling flush, the feds are offering a one-time top up of the gas-tax revenues they already give to municipalities. The cash will fund infrastructure.

Story continues below advertisement

Money spent on infrastructure is, by definition, investment. But this feels like cash being shovelled out the door, for no other reason than that it’s there for the shovelling. Needed infrastructure or not? Investment or giveaway? It’s too early to say. Likely a bit of both.

Finally, the budget lays the groundwork for the Trudeau government to propose some kind of national pharmacare program in the coming months – in the run-up to the October election. But beyond that, the books don’t appear to leave much fiscal room for any party to fill its platform with big new spending plans – barring new tax revenues, surprise windfalls or considerable accounting creativity.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Tuesday it planned to spend an additional C$1.2 billion ($902 million) over five years to stem the flow of irregular migrants from the United States, which has become a political threat to the Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Some 57,000 asylum seekers from Nigeria, El Salvador, Honduras and other nations crossed the U.S. border into Canada last year, in some cases citing a fear of persecution by the government of U.S. Donald Trump.

They are allowed to stay until their cases have been heard. Given Canada’s clogged judicial system, that could take years.

Canada began prioritizing the deportation of asylum seekers who walked across the border last year, in a bid to tackle the politically sensitive issue.

In the annual budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Ottawa would implement a comprehensive border enforcement strategy “to detect and intercept individuals who cross Canadian borders irregularly and who try to exploit Canada’s immigration system.”

Most arrive in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars taking care of the newcomers. Critics complain that Ottawa is not doing enough to deter the migrants and Liberals concede the issue is hitting the party’s popularity.

According to the budget, the government will start spending the C$1.2 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year to strengthen the border and speed up the asylum process. Ottawa will also try to “better manage, discourage and prevent irregular migration,” the budget text said.

Canadian officials have over the past two years visited Nigeria, as well as various ethnic communities in the United States, to try to persuade would-be migrants to stay put.

The officials have said that although the people driving the migrant surge claim that everyone who crosses the border is allowed to stay, most are sent back once their cases have been handled.",Canada cracks down on asylum seekers crossing U.S.-Canadian border,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R02N5-OCATP

Martin Prud’homme, who took a year off his job as director of the Sûreté du Québec provincial police force to clean up dubious practices by the Montreal police, was himself suspended earlier this month pending a criminal investigation.

In announcing the suspension of Prud’homme, Geneviève Guilbault, Quebec’s deputy premier and public safety minister, would not go into details, except to say that the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Quebec’s special police investigations unit, was looking into an allegation against Prud’homme.

Guilbault described the situation as “delicate” and “complex.”

Media reports suggest the suspension is related to the investigation of leaks to journalists about ongoing investigations by UPAC, Quebec’s permanent anti-corruption squad.

The BEI would only confirm that it was conducting a “criminal investigation following an allegation of a criminal infraction concerning Martin Prud’homme.”

Now, Quebec’s public prosecutor, the Direction des poursuites criminelles et pénales, has called on the Supreme Court of Canada to adjourn the case of Marie-Maude Denis versus Marc-Yvan Côté.

The start of hearings on that case was set for May 16.

Denis is a journalist and host of Radio-Canada’s flagship investigative program Enquête.

Côté, a former Quebec Liberal minister and fundraiser for both the federal and Quebec Liberals, along with former Quebec Liberal deputy premier Nathalie Normandeau and five others, were charged with fraud, bribery, corruption and breach of trust, related to party financing and the awarding for government contracts.

Côté’s lawyer, Jacques Larochelle, has been trying to derail the trial, alleging that leaks to Denis and other journalists about investigations involving Côté, as well as former premier Jean Charest and Liberal fundraiser Marc Bibeau, were directed from the highest levels.

Larochelle says this means his client cannot get a fair trial and he wants to force Denis to name her sources.

In a response to the adjournment request Monday, lawyer Oliver Desjardins, who is Larochelle’s associate and co-counsel in Côté’s defence, said Côté is not opposed to the adjournment motion.

Desjardins added that it would be strange to plead Côté’s case on May 16 “without knowing certain information in the possession of the court and Her Majesty the Queen,” using the formal title for the crown, or the public prosecutor.

The adjournment request, sent last Friday to Supreme Court Chief Justice Richard Wagner, says that in view of facts that have come to light in the course of the BEI investigation, the public prosecutor can no longer stand by the legal case presented in Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.

“If the Supreme Court renders a decision in this case based on the facts presented in the lower courts, it would not fully appreciate the validity of representations by the respondent (Côté) as to the necessity for him to obtain or not the disclosure of journalistic sources,” the request states.

The BEI investigations indicate that Côté’s allegations “are not frivolous and baseless,” the request continues, describing the investigation as “complex” and covering a six-year period from 2012 to 2018 that could last for several months.

There is no mention of Martin Prud’homme in the public prosecutor’s request, but he was interviewed by the RCMP in September 2017 after he contacted then UPAC head Robert Lafrenière to ask what he should do if Guy Ouellette was in touch with him.

Ouellette is a former Sûreté sergeant who was the SQ spokesman during operations against criminal biker gangs.

He was also a long-standing acquaintance of Prud’homme before he was elected as a Liberal member of the Quebec National Assembly in 2007.

Ouellette was re-elected as a Liberal in the Oct. 1 Quebec election, but now sits as an independent, after he was expelled from the party caucus for leaking Liberal secrets to the Coalition Avenir Québec, winners of the last Quebec election.

Prud’homme asked to be interviewed by the RCMP, not UPAC, to avoid conflicts of interest.

His wife is Dominique Lafrenière, a Sûreté du Québec captain responsible for criminal investigations, and daughter of Robert Lafrenière.

Ouellette was arrested but never charged in October 2017.

At the time, Lafrenière suggested at a news conference he was confident Ouellette was the source of leaks about UPAC investigations.

Media reports have indicated that in addition of Prud’homme, former UPAC investigators are among those giving testimony.",Investigation of leaks about Quebec corruption case proving ‘complex’,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/20/investigation-of-leaks-about-quebec-corruption-case-proving-complex/

Turpel-Lafond said 13 hours of hearings and testimony is not much given the importance of the issues and the fact so many other witnesses were not heard from. ""I've handled pretrial applications that have lasted twice as long.""

""Moreover, only in coarse and substandard systems of justice do we say things like 'it's over and Canadians can decide who to believe' leaving matters to the vagaries of political messaging rather than proper defensible justice processes,"" she added.

Scheer said Canadians need to know what led Wilson-Raybould to quit cabinet a month after she was punted as attorney general to veterans affairs. Wilson-Raybould insists she is still bound by cabinet confidentiality, but is willing to speak if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau releases her.

New Democrats say only a public inquiry now will ascertain whether any laws or rules were broken in the whole affair.

""People deserve answers,"" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told the Commons. ""Why will the Liberal prime minister not call for a public inquiry? What is he so afraid of?""

However, the Liberals say they've heard enough, and Canadians could judge for themselves whether any lines were crossed. In a letter to the committee chair, the five Liberal MPs on the justice committee said their minds were made up: ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed.""

Outraged, Scheer said Canadians ""expect accountability in this place and by ending the justice committee's investigation into his own corruption scandal Justin Trudeau is thumbing his nose at every single Canadian.

""His message to Canadians is 'you don't deserve to know the truth.' ""

New Democrat MPs Murray Rankin and Tracey Ramsey said with federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion on sick leave, that inquiry is on hold. Following Dion's announcement he would be taking a leave, his office issued a statement saying it would continue its work. But it is not conducting any of its inquiries in public.

Wilson-Raybould, who accused the prime minister and his team of trying to politically interfere in a bribery prosecution of the giant Quebec company, had little to say publicly Tuesday. She tweeted only that Bill Morneau had tabled his budget.

In a procedural surprise move, Morneau introduced the budget quietly in the Commons, allowing its release — pre-empting the Conservatives' vow to delay it.

But Morneau's speech was delayed, and continually interrupted.

After leading his caucus out of the Commons, Scheer warned his party was not done. He said the government tried to present a budget full of big spending to distract Canadians ""as if it were business as usual.

""It is not business as usual and we could not stand by while the Liberals pretend otherwise.

Manthorpe, a former Hong Kong correspondent, Vancouver Sun columnist and Business in Vancouver contributor, is on a speaking tour for his new book Claws of the Panda. He spoke March 13 to a decidedly anti-Communist Party of China crowd hosted by the Vancouver-based society Friends of Hong Kong.

article continues below

Claws of the Panda is an overview of Canada’s relationship with the authoritarian regime and the influence Beijing has on Canadian politicians and Canada’s Chinese diaspora. However, it was written before the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on December 1, 2018.

Manthorpe said the fallout from Meng’s arrest is the worst crisis in Canada-China relations since the two countries established mutual diplomatic relations in 1970.”

Manthorpe drew chuckles when he expressed how “queasy” he got at recent political interference in the Meng case by former ambassador to China John McCallum. Equally worrisome for Canada’s upholding of the rule of law, he said, is the alleged interference by the Prime Minister’s Office in the possible prosecution of construction firm SNC-Lavalin for bribing the Libyan government.

On the whole, he said, there is a “gulf” between China’s civic, judicial and human rights values and those upheld by Canada domestically and internationally. One example, before Meng, was when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to China expecting to discuss trade and democratic values, only for Beijing to “send him packing with a flea in his ear.”

The Meng crisis should be “welcomed” and it should force scholars and naive politicians to re-examine Canada’s relationship with the authoritarian regime, he said.

“The first task is for Canadian policy and opinion makers is to realize the Huawei crisis is an opportunity to sweep away the self-delusion that has clouded their view of the People’s Republic of China few decades,” Manthorpe said.

Manthorpe prefaced his speech and Q&A session at the downtown Vancouver Public Library by noting that his research speaks to the authoritarian regime of the People’s Republic of China and not Canada’s 1.5-million-person ethnic Chinese diaspora. He acknowledged that speaking frankly about the subject locally is difficult given the social and cultural ties Canada, and especially Vancouver, has with China, Taiwan and especially Hong Kong, a city with about 300,000 Canadian passport holders.

He expressed disappointment after hearing about one person who did not want to attend his talk, fearing it would be an “anti-Chinese” event.

Manthorpe said raising legitimate issues about Canada-China relations usually provokes controversy.

“We saw it, for example, in the whole business of the investment in real estate in Vancouver and Toronto. We saw real estate agents rolling out the racism card,” he said, adding that Chinese government officials accused Canada of white supremacy after Meng’s arrest.

To maintain objectivity, Manthorpe said, he wrote his book entirely from the public record.

His book delves into, among other things, how agents of the authoritarian regime exert pressure on ethnic Chinese people overseas who have either personal or business ties to China.

China, he says, employs agents in Canada who meddle in local political affairs via organized, typically pro-business or “friendship” groups. Local politicians, he notes, are increasingly falling under the influence of those groups.

“These agents have been able to come over here and work with no pushback from Canadian authorities,” he said. “The fact that we have very similar campaigns in Australia and New Zealand as we have in Canada gives me great satisfaction that I’m not a conspiracy theorist.”

There is some hope of pushback within government, however, he said. Last May, in Vancouver, China’s propaganda wing, the United Front Work Department, organized the ninth Conference of the World Guangdong Community Federation, which saw over 200 Chinese nationals slated to attend the event denied visas. Premier John Horgan, MLA Teresa Wat, MP Alice Wong and Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie attended the conference, among others.

The United Front is reportedly used to quash dissent and stifle criticism of the Communist Party of China while promoting the party’s political goals, such as bringing Hong Kong and Taiwan into its grasp or undermining the liberal democratic order.

Manthorpe stressed Sino-Canadian relationships will likely need to be developed outside of government activity given the level of influence pro-Beijing groups are exerting on Canadian politicians.

He also called interference in local Chinese media “quite appalling,” noting a free exchange of ideas in the Mandarin-language press is fundamental.

Canadians, he said, should keep in mind the repressed minorities in China and those who are threatened and punished for speaking out against the Chinese government.

“We’re certainly going to make sure that Canadians understand that what is going on in Parliament regarding Justin Trudeau’s coverup is really important to know,” Conservative Member of Parliament Lisa Raitt, said in an interview with CBC News.

The Conservatives are protesting a move by majority Liberals on a justice committee to end an investigation into the SNC affair. Liberals have said there has been ample time for the committee to hear testimony.

The budget — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s last before Canada’s next election — comes as the Liberal government has been roiled by a scandal involving SNC-Lavalin that has seen four high profile resignations.

The budget is not expected to dramatically change the country’s fiscal course. Trudeau is expected to use a revenue windfall to increase spending on social programs — and the deficit — as the economy starts to wobble.

A protesting First Nations woman who was pushed to the ground during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Climate Action Rally at the Danforth Music Hall on March 4, says the prime minister “witnessed” her being assaulted, and “did nothing.”

The woman is 26-year-old Vanessa Gray, a community organizer from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation. In a press release written a few days after the incident, Gray said it is disturbing that many of the people who attended the event, including Trudeau himself, did nothing.

At the event, Trudeau was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers and protestors in the crowd, who were immediately ushered out by security.

Gray said she went to ensure that the voices of Indigenous people were present and draw attention to the ongoing colonial and environmental violence that indigenous people experience in Canada.

Before arriving at the event, Gray hid a Canadian flag in her shirt that said, “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.”

She said it was to remind those at the event that ground zero of environmental violence is occurring right now on unceded land.

Videos and photographs of the incident have been making the rounds online.

During Trudeau’s speech, Gray threw her flag and shouted “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.” Seconds later, an older white man, in a blue shirt, pushed her down to the floor.

“Shocked, but not deterred I rose up and continued to speak, ‘No Justice on Stolen Native Land.’ I said this over and over until security pulled me from the rally,” she wrote in her statement.

While Gray was quickly escorted out, the man, who is yet to be identified, remained inside the event and continued to cheer Trudeau on.

In a video taken during the event, Trudeau can be seen witnessing the scuffle and uttering “Oh boy, oh boy,” moments after Gray is pushed to the ground.

Gray has been speaking up against environmental violence for eight years.

She and her lawyer Nick Cake, with Millars Law, are considering her legal options. Cake said they are in a preliminary stage and are reviewing all options and working to determine the best possible path.

“Our options include filing a police report because police didn’t take any action on that day. Another avenue will be civil remedies that may be available. Another would be to leverage a conversation between Vanessa and the prime minister’s office,” he said.

“Situations like this have a way of fizzling off and falling off into the background and essentially being forgotten about. It’s our intention to keep this fresh and to keep it going so it does not become outdated or a situation that lacks the public’s interest,” Cake said.

In an email statement, Liberal Party spokesperson Parker Lund said the safety of all Canadians attending such events is a top priority and that the incident has been brought to their attention. The party is taking steps to review the matter with the appropriate authorities and staff, Lund said.",Woman pushed at Liberal rally at Danforth Music Hall considering legal options,Beach Metro Community News,https://www.beachmetro.com/2019/03/21/woman-pushed-at-liberal-rally-at-danforth-music-hall-considering-legal-options/
78,,2019-03-21T13:23:00.0000000Z,But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession ... mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups. Remember infrastructure?,"The 2019 federal budget, like all recent federal budgets, is a tribute to the pleasures of endless economic growth.

In the days when inflation was high, interest rates were volatile and growth was very stop and go, budgeting was hard work. Reining in runaway deficits absorbed most of the energies of finance ministers for the better part of three decades.

But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession in the last quarter-century, and a mild one at that. Budgeting in such times is comparative child’s play — governments, at the federal level at least, have to positively go out of their way to run deficits.

Indeed, so steady has the revenue-gusher been — no government has ever had as much money to play with, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars per citizen — that the Liberals have been obliged to perform quite heroic feats of spending just to keep pace. Though real per capita spending is at all-time record levels, the deficit remains stubbornly below one per cent of GDP — hardly a deficit at all, really. My God, in the fiscal year just ending, the deficit actually fell: revenues came in faster (6.8 per cent) than even the Liberals could spend them (4.9 per cent).

I’ve said before that these are deficits of choice, rather than necessity. A better way to describe them might be deficits for show. Not even the Liberals still pretend deficits of this size would have any impact on growth, nor have they: real growth per capita in the bad old Harper years, from fiscal 2007 to 2016, averaged 0.9 per cent — versus 0.7 per cent, actual and projected, in the shining new era ushered in by the Liberals (2017-2024).

Indeed, they’re not even supposed to. Their impact is, first, symbolic — behold, we run deficits because we like to, whereas the previous government did so only grudgingly! — and second, to permit the government to spend more, mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups.

Remember infrastructure? That was supposed to differentiate the new Liberal deficit spending from the old Liberal deficit spending. It wasn’t about pork-barrel politics, or short-run economic fixes. It was about making strategic investments that would increase productivity for the long run. Only it hasn’t quite worked out that way, has it?

The budget boasts that federal infrastructure spending has increased from $8 billion in fiscal 2016 to $14 billion in the current fiscal year. That’s an increase of $6 billion, which sounds like a lot, until you realize total program spending has increased by $47-billion in the same period. At one point the Liberals used to claim one dollar in three of new spending would go to infrastructure. The actual result: more like one in eight.

It is time, then, for the conversation to move on: from how spending is financed to what it is spent on, from the size of government to its composition, from the macro to the micro. Deficits of this size are not going to ruin us, as the opposition claims; neither would eliminating them, as the finance minister pretends.

The quantity of spending isn’t so much the issue as the quality. It isn’t that we can’t afford it: it’s that, in the rush to get all that spending out the door, little thought appears to have been given to whether the money is being spent in the best way, or whether it should be spent at all.

The most telling table in the budget is the last: the one that tallies up the estimated savings from the several “comprehensive reviews” of spending the government claims to have undertaken. The total annual saving: $237 million. Out of a budget of $323.5 billion.

Perhaps one day something a little more stringent will be attempted. And perhaps this budget’s signature initiatives on training and housing, which give every impression of having been cooked up in the Prime Minister’s Office, if not in party election planning sessions, will be the subject.

The training chapter notes, with evident satisfaction, that the government now spends close to $7.5 billion a year on skill development “across more than 100 distinct programs.” Given the country’s acute and growing skills shortages, some questions might be asked about their efficacy. Some, but not too many: a review of skills programming provided “an opportunity to reflect on past successes and determine where more can be done.”

Such a forgiving attitude to the past does not bode well for the future. Has any serious analysis been done of the new Canada Training Benefit — how it will interact with provincial programs, what sort of training will be eligible, and so on?

Likewise for the government’s suite of new policies to make housing more affordable. The budget acknowledges the only real solution to high house prices in the long run is to increase the supply of houses. But the specific measures it announces would mostly stimulate the demand — notably a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive that would involve the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, worryingly, in lending directly to prospective buyers. The details are sketchier than sketchy, but any benefit would more than likely be capitalized into prices. Would anyone really be made better off?

But why ask hard questions, when growth is endless and budgets need never be balanced? Except … even if the business cycle has been abolished, and growth does persist, it will be much slower growth than we have known, now that the Baby Boomers are hitting their retirement years. That may not be of much concern to the feds, who largely insulated themselves, in the deficit-slashing years, from the fiscal consequences. But it’s a huge problem for the provinces, who will have to pay to look after all those aging Boomers.

What would the budget do to stimulate growth in the long run — to improve Canada’s sluggish productivity record, to arrest the alarming decline in business investment, to reform Canada’s complex, growth-killing corporate and personal income tax system?

Er, nothing, as it happens. For as it has been said, in the long run we are all out of office.","Andrew Coyne: Federal budget a testament to the pleasures of endless growth.

1919: A Graphic History of the Winnipeg General Strike Graphic History Collective and David Lester Between The Lines, 2019

“History is an important resource for people who want to change the world.” (vii)

This opening line captures the philosophy of the Graphic History Collective (GHC), whose books and posters have not only helped to amplify the history of marginalized populations, but breathe new life into how we present history. The GHC projects have seized the visual medium to intertwine historical knowledge and context with the sort of impressions which can only be summoned through the poignancy of illustration.

In this way, 1919: A Graphic History of the Winnipeg General Strike is a worthy addition to an already impressive lineup. After an introduction by historian Jim Naylor, which lays out the rationale for the Strike being rooted in a national and international working-class revolt against capitalism, the graphic novel begins in earnest.

The project is a wonderful distillation of the Strike’s series of events, antecedents, and motivations of its key actors, elevated with evoking images that place the reader among the strikers. Particularly immersive is the minute-by-minute depiction of the Bloody Saturday clashes where, with almost no words, the story of that day is told. You can see the workers protesting jailed Strike leaders, the overturning of a scab-operated streetcar, and the violent response from thugs and Mounties, including their killing of immigrant workers Mike Sokolowski and Mike Schezerbanowicz.

Crucially, the book perceptively roots the origins of the Strike, not just in the developments of total war and industrial capitalism, but in the systematic dispossession and genocide of the Indigenous peoples who called these lands home. Capital’s dominance of the city and its environs would have been impossible without it. Along this line, the book does well to connect the events in Winnipeg to working-class protest across Canada and the globe.

Much more could be said, but it is imperative to note how David Lester and company deftly demonstrate how the Strike materialized, starting as a plan laid by the city’s craft unionists, before expanding to include most of the city’s working-class, women and men, union and non-union, British and non-British. Equally noteworthy, the book highlights how Canada and Winnipeg’s capitalist elite organized to crush the Strike, largely through a systematic program of redbaiting, thuggery, show trials, and bigotry. It was they—supposedly—who stood for venerated British institutions in the face of Bolshevik and ‘alien’ interlopers.

It should be stressed that this graphic novel finishes strong in demonstrating that the Strike’s impacts aren’t crystalized in 1919. Rather, it influenced broad Canadian labour and left movements, from the more immediate expansion of industrial unionism and rise of the Communist Party and Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, to the longer-range influence the event had in inspiring activism, protest, and social reform generations later, including in our own times. This acts as an effective bridge to the GHC’s Direct Action Gets the Goods, which examines the broader history of how strikes have wrought social, political, and economic change in Canada.

But above all, 1919’s greatest strength is that it has deep value, both for those unfamiliar with the history of the Strike, and for even the most seasoned scholars of the Canadian labour and left movements.

There is much here for everybody.

It was almost genetic. “That’s changing.","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

Canada gets closer to a right to repair law

Meet a 12-year-old Canadian climate striker

Tidal power is literally making waves

The truth about Styrofoam

Is the right to repair ready for prime time?

(Michaela Rehle/Reuters)

When Michael Coteau's daughter dropped his Samsung Galaxy S8 this past fall, cracking it all over, the Ontario Liberal MPP kept using it for a while.

""But then it started irritating my ear, because the glass was kind of breaking apart,"" he said.

It's greener to repair such a device than recycle it and buy a new one — Nicole Mortillaro has pointed out how environmentally damaging it is to manufacture mobile devices. Recycling and disposal is also energy intensive, and many parts end up in the landfill.

But as CBC reported last fall, manufacturers often make it expensive and difficult to get devices repaired. They force customers to use ""authorized"" shops that often charge more than it would cost to buy a new device, restrict access to spare parts and manuals or even use software to render devices unusable if they've undergone ""unauthorized"" repair.

Coteau wanted to repair his Samsung, but given the aforementioned challenges, he ended up replacing it with a new phone. ""It's a waste,"" he said. ""It was a working device.""

These repair issues don't apply just to mobile devices, but increasingly to vehicles and smart appliances, from TVs to washing machines.

The good news is governments are starting to fight back with ""right to repair"" legislation. Last week, Coteau introduced a private member's bill amending Ontario's Consumer Protection Act that represents the first right to repair legislation ever proposed in Canada.

The bill would force brands to:

Provide consumers or electronics repair shops with replacement parts, software and tools for diagnosing, maintaining or repairing their products, for a fair price.

Provide electronic documents such as repair manuals for free.

Reset any electronic security that may disable the device during diagnosis, maintenance or repair.

Coteau said the goal is to reduce environmental waste, allow repairs to be made locally and encourage innovation.

The ""right to repair"" movement is picking up around the world for different kinds of products. Similar legislation for electronics is being considered in 18 U.S. states. A bill passed in Massachusetts in 2012 after a public referendum already requires car manufacturers to provide documents to allow anyone to repair their vehicles.

The U.S. also modified rules last fall allowing consumers to legally hack software in their devices as needed for repair and maintenance. In Europe, proposed right to repair legislation covers appliances such as fridges and washing machines.

Because Coteau isn't a member of Ontario's ruling party, his private member's bill may be stuck in debate for awhile.

In the meantime, here's some good news: ""Dumb"" devices — i.e. gadgets that don't contain a computer chip, like radios or blenders — can often be fixed for free at volunteer-run ""repair cafes"" across the country.

Meet a 12-year-old Canadian climate striker

(Andrew Gage)

If you've been following the news at all, you've likely heard about the youth-led protests worldwide in favour of greater climate action. The best-known participant is Sweden's Greta Thunberg, who has been skipping school every Friday since August to ""strike for climate."" The forthright 16-year-old, who has chastised adults at both the COP24 climate conference in December and the World Economic Forum in January, has inspired many young people — including 12-year-old Rebecca Wolf Gage (above).

Wolf Gage attends Shoreline Community Middle School in Victoria, and on the first Friday of every month, she and other students leave class and march down to the mayor's office to discuss local green initiatives.

What first inspired you to become involved in raising awareness of climate change?

My dad is very environmental, and he taught me about climate change from a young age. He inspires me almost every day, but didn't tell me to take on activism. Greta Thunberg also inspires me so much. If you have time to watch her interviews, please do. They are amazing! When I was five, I decided to support the Green Party even though my parents usually voted for a different party. That was when I realized that I was an environmental activist.

What has been the reaction of your teachers?

My teachers aren't supportive of me striking, but they're not unsympathetic. I have heard that some of the other strikers have less sympathetic teachers, and I'm lucky to have good ones at Shoreline Community Middle School.

Do you think your fellow students understand the importance of stopping climate change?

I find that most of my classmates either don't think that climate change is a big deal, or don't think there's any way to stop it. But I have a lot of friends who I strike with that are as passionate as I am about stopping climate change.

What sorts of climate-friendly ideas have you pitched to the mayor?

We started meeting with the mayor two months ago. Lisa Helps is the best mayor I've ever met around environmental issues. Many of us have addressed the CRD [Capital Regional District] board, where they announced the climate emergency resolution, brought forward by Mayor Helps. We have also set a goal of getting free bus passes for kids 18 and under throughout the CRD.

What are you planning in the coming months to keep this issue on people's minds?

For the coming months, we're going to try to advertise the climate strike as much as possible. On May 3, it's a huge national climate strike. In the summer, we are thinking about holding an environmental summer camp for youth to come learn about climate change and the climate strike. We have done a one-day enviro school before, and it was a success.

If you could do one thing to take this fight to the next level, what would it be?

If I could convince the Canadian government to set high climate targets and actually meet them, my dream would have come true. I think for now, an easier thing to do is to get 1,000 climate strikers in Victoria.

— Andre Mayer

The Big Picture: Tidal power

In seeking ways to generate electricity, jurisdictions around the world inevitably look at their natural endowments. For countries with especially choppy waters, that has included tidal power, which exploits the kinetic energy of changing tides. Here's a look at the biggest tidal power projects in the world.

(CBC)

What's on your mind?

Nicole Mortillaro's story last week on OOM, a Canadian company that has created a standalone, off-grid power unit for large buildings, stirred a lot of interest — both positive and negative.

One reader wrote in to say, ""I started to get a little concerned when I learned that it takes companies off the grid, which in Ontario largely provides energy from clean sources, and will be providing electricity from natural gas.""

Another reader had this suggestion: ""The country does not need OOM or anything else. What it needs is reliable electricity hidden underground!"" The idea of burying power lines has been bandied about for a while — with the acknowledgement that it is a very expensive undertaking.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

A new study suggests that the expansion of our urban environment is leading more animals to ingest ""human food,"" which is affecting their biology and behaviour. One example: Some bears are hibernating for shorter periods.

Canadian political watchers know that the popularity of the federal NDP has been flagging, notably in Quebec. This column suggests that in order to win back a large number of (environmentally minded) Quebecers, Jagmeet Singh's party should propose a Canadian version of the Green New Deal.

One big takeaway from this week: Government policies to reduce carbon emissions work. That was the finding of a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, which revealed that between 2005 and 2015, CO2 levels in 18 countries (including many European countries and the U.S. — but not Canada) declined.

In what seems like poetic environmental justice, a research team led by RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, has figured out a carbon capture process that sucks CO2 out of the air and turns it into … coal.



Styrofoam and the environment: It's complicated

(Emily Chung/CBC)

Amid all the recent talk of banning plastic, many environmentally conscious consumers wonder: What about Styrofoam?

Also known as plastic foam, the scientific term for it is expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), and it can be found in everything from takeout containers to helmets to car bumpers.

The worldwide production capacity of polystyrene in 2016 was 14.7 million tonnes, according to industry group Plastics Insight. It is estimated that 80 per cent of Canada's foam packaging ends up in the garbage, contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic annually discarded in oceans.

According to Science Learning Hub, it can take up to 500 years for one foam cup to break down.

Indianapolis-based plastic manufacturing expert Kelvin Okamato points out that there are two common versions of polystyrene: expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) and extruded polystyrene foam (XPS). EPS is used to create foam cups and takeout containers, whereas XPS is used to make packing material as well as insulation board for buildings.

The main reason polystyrene is so ubiquitous is that it is lightweight, rigid, versatile and able to withstand dramatic temperature changes. According to a 2016 study, 40 per cent of polystyrene is made for the food packaging industry — and EPS foam containers in the industry are at an all-time high.

Food Safety Magazine has noted that polystyrene foam trays are economically beneficial because they are cheap to produce and dispose of, and the fact that they're single-use helps with food safety.

While styrofoam has long seemed like an environmental villain, a recent European-based study found that manufacturing EPS containers has a lower environmental impact — minimal material and electricity requirements for manufacture — than two other common takeaway containers, which are made of aluminum and polypropylene.

Alberta-based manufacturing expert Odessa Ingarfield said the main problem is that polystyrene isn't manufactured to be recycled. In many places around the globe, polystyrene is difficult to recycle because its petroleum base is hard to break down, while the lightweight and clunky shape makes it expensive to transport.

So much of it gets thrown out.

""Designers now are asked to design a product, but not the recyclability of that product,"" said Ingarfield.

She believes that rather than banning EPS production, companies should be finding a way to repurpose it through a closed-loop recycling process, where waste is collected, processed and recycled back to its original material, or a two-stage processing facility.

Okamato and Ingarfield both believe changes to consumer behaviour will improve the environmental impact of polystyrene, and plastics more generally.

""If you want to use plastics, then make sure you know what you are using it for,"" said Ingarfield. ""If you plan on leaving [the item] behind to degrade, then don't use plastics.""

(The Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick)

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled his fourth budget in Ottawa today, an election-year measure that not only plays up the positive effect Liberal policy has had on the economy — especially the historically low unemployment numbers — but, perhaps more importantly, primes voters who will head to the polls this year.

One thing this budget — which announces $23 billion in new spending — does not do is eliminate the deficit, which the Liberals promised they would do away with by their fourth budget. The fact that they missed this target by $23 billion sends a clear signal that they’re comfortable with running deficits going forward.

Goodies for Middle Age and Older Canadians

Though the big news was a scheme to help millennials buy their first home, there were several measures that were clearly aimed at older Canadians:

The government will create the Canadian Drug Agency whose role will be the creation of a national drug plan somewhere down the road, likely before the election. (Trudeau first hinted at the possibility of a national pharmacare plan during an August 2018 interview with Zoomer magazine in which he unequivocally promised “It’s coming.”)

in which he unequivocally promised “It’s coming.”) Changes to the Guaranteed Income Supplement program will allow older low-income Canadians to earn $1,500 more (raised from $3,500 to $5,000) before their benefit is clawed back

$50 billion for a National Dementia Strategy.

A $1.7 billion initiative that will offer money to middle-age Canadians to retrain for new job skills. They will also be able to hang on to their current jobs even if they leave for re-training

Introduction of new measures, possibly changing federal law, to protect pensioners of companies that go bankrupt

Canadians over the age of 70 who have not applied for the Canada Pension Plan will be automatically enrolled

CARP’s initial reaction to the budgetary measures aimed at older Canadians was very positive — it seemed many were drawn directly from it’s national advocacy platform The Faces of Canada’s Seniors. “We’ve been calling for significant changes to safeguard Canadians as we age,” said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CARP’s Chief Public Policy Officer. “The government has listened.”

There was plenty of pre-budget drama today. Before Morneau had finished lacing up his new budget-day shoes, the Conservatives threatened to delay the release of the document in protest to the Liberal’s refusal to recall Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify at the House Justice Committee looking into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

At a press conference earlier in the day, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer raised the possibility that his party planned to disrupt Morneau’s attempt to table the budget by slowing down a vote (on an unrelated matter) in the House of Commons.

“Justin Trudeau shut down the justice committee investigation into his corruption scandal. If he expects us to quietly accept a cover-up, he will get a rude awakening this afternoon,” Scheer said.","Federal Budget 2019: Morneau Offers Lots of Goodies For Middle-Age, Senior Canadians",Everything Zoomer,http://www.everythingzoomer.com/general/2019/03/19/budget-2019-gis-training-pharamcare/

The voice of the first people is not only in print, media or communications that are discernible by mainstream measurements. The voice of the first people is the land. The voice of the first people is the water. The voice of the first people stretches centuries back to our creation stories. It is a voice that resounds with power and strength on this land.

When Jody Wilson Raybould evoked the words of the true Indigenous laws of this land, these words resonated into the cosmos. Initial reactions from Mainstream media were the incredulity at what Wilson Raybould shared with the justice committee. Very quickly, global media sources were quoting this event.

An Indigenous woman, originally from the west coastal people was delivering in the Canadian House of Commons a lesson on what the “rule of law” actually meant. She did not get this understanding from her undergrad or degree from mainstream institutions. Jody Wilson Raybould reminded the world and herself that the original laws and teachings of her own people are instilled within her own blood memory and DNA.

Global media focused on the past corruption of a global corporate actor, the placement of deferred prosecution agreement, or remediation agreement in an omnibus bill, and the unwillingness of a Liberal cabinet to lose footing or seats in the province of Quebec.

The corruption of a Liberal or Conservative government is not something new to the First Nations or people like Jody Wilson Raybould have had to encounter. In 2012, the Conservative sitting federal government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper put forth an omnibus bill where they attacked the protection of waters and also, hidden in this legislation was also an amendment to land surrenders or designations on reserve. But Harper’s Bill C-38 had one positive outcome. It united the indigenous people in Canada and launched the IdleNoMore movement.

Similarly, with Jody Wilson Raybould, there is an “indigenous take” on her testimony. The most important factor was not the fact that the Liberals were guilty of some serious corporate cronyism. The most important factor was that after 152 years, a sitting member of the white Canadian parliament had not followed the rule of whiteman made law. Jody Wilson Raybould quoted her own experiential learning, the laws of the Big House and her position as a matriarch and truth-teller.

This action by Jody Wilson Raybould was heard, not only by the Indigenous people throughout this land called Canada; the land, itself, heard her words. Our ancestors are in this land. The relationship between the Indigenous and the land is absolute. Repeated attempts to explain the spiritual significance and cosmic connection that the original people have in this territory falls deafly on mainstream ears.

The Indigenous “anthropomorphize” tangible objects. Mainstream sees a tree and a specific land area in monetary terms. The Indigenous sees the same tree, but they see the places where our people took shade or sheltered. The Indigenous know the place name and the stories of this place and the power that still lives. The difference in our memories and the difference in our history, means the application of law will be different for the Indigenous and the non-native who are guests in this land.

This is the conflict between Mainstream and the Indigenous. This is why there can be no reconciliation. For the Indigenous to reconcile, they have the option of assimilating into the larger society and becoming “equal” to the non-native so that they can finally take up their roles as “Canadians”. The indigenous must come to see the tree as just a tree with a price tag or a value attached.

If the Indigenous cannot see this tree like a commodity, they have a second option. This option is to maintain their Indigenous teachings and understanding and to go forward until the larger society begins to reconcile their view with our understanding.

Jody Wilson Raybould has opened this doorway. Only after the initial fray, mainstream media began to write that Jody’s words returned her to her teachings as a Kwakwaka’wakw person.

Therefore the heart of democracy and the noble action Jody Wilson Raybould took in not acquiescing to party pressure came from who she is as a person. Integrity cannot be taught. Integrity must come from within and must be supported by the systems that exist around a person.

In the Indigenous systems, there is respect for all life, because the Indigenous understand the Creator, the Great Mystery has made all things. There is no hierarchy of animals, rocks or water, there is only existence and co-existence. In this system, if you value or respect the land, the waters, the animals, the plants and all things, you have innate respect before any other measurable.

Where is the integrity in the non-native system? With technology, humans separate themselves from each other and from the natural world. With this separation, there is no connection, no reminder and no awe for the wonders of this world. Within the mainstream system, there are false examples of integrity like returning a lost wallet. If there is money involved, and money is measured, then there is integrity in this action.

When the newcomers to this land begin to operate in a system of interconnected understanding, they too will begin to understand what integrity means. It is standing at the edge of headwaters, looking at the mountains and seeing a line of shadowed ancestors, praying and resting in the foothills. It is in seeing a grizzly bear show its young how to push over trees in an area that has always been where the grizzlies go to dance. It is returning to the places where salmon swim against the current to reach their destination with determination and glory. It is in the comforting winds that gently rock babies to sleep in their swings. All these things do not cost and have no “apparent” monetary value. The value is in the eternal song of life that continues because of the respect, the integrity and the love each part shares for the other.

Some 57,000 asylum seekers from Nigeria, El Salvador, Honduras, and other nations crossed the U.S. border into Canada last year, in some cases citing a fear of persecution by the government of U.S. Donald Trump.

They are allowed to stay until their cases have been heard. Given Canada’s clogged judicial system, that could take years.

Canada said on Tuesday it planned to spend an additional C$1.2 billion ($902 million) over five years to stem the flow of irregular migrants from the United States, which has become a political threat to the Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Canada began prioritising the deportation of asylum seekers who walked across the border last year, in a bid to tackle the politically sensitive issue.

In the annual budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Ottawa would implement a comprehensive border enforcement strategy “to detect and intercept individuals who cross Canadian borders irregularly and who try to exploit Canada’s immigration system.”

Most arrive in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars taking care of the newcomers. Critics complain that Ottawa is not doing enough to deter the migrants and Liberals concede the issue is hitting the party’s popularity.

According to the budget, the government will start spending the C$1.2 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year to strengthen the border and speed up the asylum process. Ottawa will also try to “better manage, discourage and prevent irregular migration,” the budget text said.

Canadian officials have over the past two years visited Nigeria, as well as various ethnic communities in the United States, to try to persuade would-be migrants to stay put.

The officials have said that although the people driving the migrant surge claim that everyone who crosses the border is allowed to stay, most are sent back once their cases have been handled.

Derek Fildebrandt said that policy is part of the FCP plan to fundamentally change Alberta's relationship with the federal government.

""Only the Freedom Conservative Party is dedicated to breaking the grip of Ottawa and putting Alberta first,"" he said as he unveiled the first plank of his party's platform at the Bridgeland Community Association in northeast Calgary.

Fildebrandt also promised the FCP would demand that Alberta be allowed to collect its own taxes, control policing in the province and control immigration.

""I am tired of Alberta being treated as a second-class colony,"" he said, promising that if major changes don't happen soon, his party would also hold a referendum independence for Alberta.

He summed up his first policy announcement as, ""More Alberta, less Ottawa.""

The FCP bills itself as ""a coalition of grassroots conservatives, libertarians and Alberta patriots.""

Fildebrandt, the sitting MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, said Wednesday that he expects to field roughly 30 candidates in the election, which is set for April 16.

Alberta's rights to self-govern are top of mind, Fildebrandt said, alluding to Quebec's separation movement.

Freedom Conservatives would, he said, offer voters the chance to decide ""if they want to continue the relationship with Ottawa,"" should the federal government not ""accept reasonable demands for equality for Alberta within Canada.""

""We want to be treated the same as… Quebec, to have control of our own immigration, our own tax collection, our own police force, our own pension and EI — and the complete end of equalization,"" Fildebrandt said.

The provincial election was announced Monday, and the other main contenders — the NDP, United Conservative Party, Alberta Party and Alberta Liberals — all held events to discuss their messages for the race.

The Freedom Conservatives were missing from the first day of announcements. Instead, the party has an event scheduled for Thursday in Calgary to discuss platform points.

""We're not running paper candidates everywhere just to have a number of candidates,"" Fildebrandt said Wednesday. ""We want to have people running where we believe they can actually win.""

The party has strategically placed candidates in ridings where it believes the NDP are less likely to win a seat, he said.

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

READ MORE: Oil producers want to see policies that will double industry’s growth in Alberta election

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

WATCH: UCP leads NDP ahead of 2019 Alberta election

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 per cent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 per cent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

READ MORE: Notley kicks off election Day 2 with vow to double Alberta’s oil and gas incentives

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

Scandal brewing

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jeff Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

READ MORE: Pipeline politics to affect economy, two elections in 2019, economists say

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University.

Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

WATCH: Jason Kenney responds to Caylan Ford’s resignation from UCP race

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”",Canada’s battered oil industry cheering for Alberta’s opposition party in upcoming election,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5079770/oil-industry-alberta-2019-election/

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

On the season two finale of Political Blind Date, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant and Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus debate the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement. ( TVO )

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

Article Continued Below

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive. Conservatives want to change the agreement with the U.S. to allow Canada to send those claiming refugee status after crossing at irregular locations back to the U.S.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, while standing at the north side of Roxham Road, the Quebec location where the majority of border crossings have happened over the last two years for irregular asylum claimants.

We only need to look at countries where press freedom is absent or political dissent is illegal to know how important the responsibility of the media and opposition is to holding governments accountable.

That said, opposition parties who want to form government by claiming revulsion at alleged government improprieties are often disappointed at election time. While it is frequently suggested that governments defeat themselves, opposition parties seeking to take over need a positive message about intent and priorities to make the transition into government. The unusual policy-free “For the People” victory of the Doug Ford Conservatives in Ontario in 2018 – and the rapidly collapsing approval levels for that administration – bodes ill for any party hoping to inherit the keys to the store without earning the privilege. Both Justin Trudeau in 2015 and Stephen Harper in 2006, 2008 and 2011 had policy proposals and clear priorities for which to seek public support.

Canadian Conservatives, and those Canadians of other or no affiliation searching for alternatives this October, have the right to expect a substantive platform and set of priorities from the Conservatives.

Canadian Conservatives … have the right to expect a substantive platform and set of priorities from (their party).

There are different paths Conservatives can take. One is the path seeking to mine as much dissatisfaction and animus as possible by blindly opposing every Liberal policy from immigration to pipelines, carbon taxes and rebates, or defence and foreign policy.

The other is to offer Canadians a robust and positive conservatism, replete with fresh ideas, nation and economy-building proposals and clear and compelling priorities – none of which would weaken Conservative principles of “smarter as opposed to larger” government; fair as opposed to excessive taxation; and equality of opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.

The Century Initiative Foundation in Canada, a distinguished mix of business, academic, volunteer sector and representative individuals, has a series of proposals for how Canada can achieve a population of 100 million people by 2100. It is nation-building at its best. If we want more clout at trade and environmental negotiations, in international forums and with enhanced strategic and defence capacity that facilitates a more pronounced independence for Canada, these are ideas Conservatives should consider and find a way to offer.

Fresh concepts on how to reduce poverty without growing the bureaucracies that manage existing, poverty-preserving welfare programs, would also be welcome. There is no contradiction within mainstream Conservative or Canadian mindsets between humane and effective government and reducing inefficiencies and burgeoning administrative overheads. Replacing the bureaucracy of the Indian Act (unbecoming to Canada and disrespectful to First Nations), is a classic Conservative project based on building trust, shared revenues and genuine respect for First Nations. And it could be incorporated into an economic growth plan for Canada.

Nor is there any reason Canadian Conservatives need to avoid frank discussion on foreign and defence policy. While much of both policies are, for good reason, non-partisan in substance, there is room for Conservative innovation on procurement, an Arctic strategy, relations with China and other authoritarian partners, and doubling the size of our Navy and Air Force over a reasonable period of time. And, if carbon taxes, deemed by some Conservatives as the devil’s spawn, are not the answer, neither is not having a policy that does not curb consumption of fossil fuels. It is not in the country’s or party’s interest.

The lure of dog whistle politics (decrying asylum seekers arriving through non-official border entries and knowing this will attract the anti-immigration and anti-diversity vote; or declining to support statutory reform of the Senate, while hoping not to get caught campaigning for the “all partisan all the time” Senate of yore) may work for a moment in time. But the conservatism of anger, resentment, turning back the clock, ignoring legitimate constitutional and self-government rights of First Nations, have rarely, in Canadian politics, won elections.

The negative approach not only underestimates the Canadian voter but affords the incumbent government and other parties strategic and tactical options that a more positive and constructive Conservative approach might supercede.

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 percent in an Ipsos/Global News ...","CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s battered oil industry is rooting for the opposition in next month’s election in energy heartland Alberta, investors said on Wednesday, but a brewing scandal involving the party’s leader could derail its hopes of an easy victory.

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 percent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 percent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

SCANDAL BREWING

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jason Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”","Ahead of Alberta vote, Canada's oil industry roots for the opposition",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/idCAKCN1R12T0-OCADN

FILE PHOTO: A tanker truck used to haul oil products operates at an oil facility near Brooks, Alberta, Canada April 18, 2018. Picture taken April 18, 2018. REUTERS/Todd Korol

Premier Rachel Notley has not yet set a date for the election, but Alberta law states it must be held between March 1 and May 31.

Voters will be asked to cast their ballots at a time of controversial government intervention in Alberta’s oil market that has drawn support from some major producers and fierce criticism from others.

The NDP stunned many political commentators when it swept to power in Alberta in 2015 in the midst of the global oil price crash, ending 44 years of conservative rule in the province.

Since then Notley’s government has grappled with shrinking capital investment in the province’s energy sector and persistent budget deficits, and is focused on convincing voters an economic recovery is underway.

“We remain on track to balance the budget by 2023, with the best balance sheet in the country. We are doing this without making reckless cuts to the services all Albertans rely on,” the government said in a speech to the legislature delivered by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Lois Mitchell.

Effective Jan. 1, the Alberta government mandated oil production cuts to help relieve congestion on export pipelines that last year led to a glut of crude building up in storage and the price of Canadian barrels plummeting to record lows.

The move threw a lifeline to oil producers selling their barrels at a loss but has been harshly criticized by integrated companies with refining operations like Suncor Energy and Husky Energy that were benefiting from cheap crude.

On Friday Imperial Oil delayed a C$2.6 billion oil sands project in northern Alberta and laid the blame squarely on the uncertainty generated by government intervention in the market.

The provincial government also plans to lease 4,400 rail cars to transport crude while waiting for long-delayed export pipelines to be built, even though stronger oil prices as a result of curtailments mean rail transportation is no longer economic.

Opposition leader Jason Kenney has promised to rip up those rail contracts if the UCP wins the election, adding to uncertainty in the oil industry.

Notley said her government will continue to manage curtailments and the differential between Canadian and U.S. crude slowly and carefully.

“This is not the long-term solution...Long-term we need more pipelines and more value added in Alberta,” she told a news conference.",Canada's Alberta kicks off final legislature session before election,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1QZ2KG-OCABS

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The western Canadian province of Alberta will hold an election on April 16, kick-starting a contest that many polls suggest will result in a change of government in the country's oil-producing heartland as it struggles with a sluggish economy.

Premier Rachel Notley's left-leaning New Democratic Party won a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015, ending 44 years of conservative rule, but inherited a provincial economy rocked by the collapse of global oil prices.

Notley was initially an ally of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and backed his attempts to please the oil industry and environmentalists by championing export pipelines while also introducing carbon pricing.

The relationship soured last year over efforts to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, prompting Notley to pull her support for Trudeau's carbon plan. Ottawa bought the pipeline, whose expansion remains delayed.

The opposition has criticized Notley for her alliance with Trudeau, who is viewed by some Albertans as out of touch with the oil industry's woes.

Alberta's government has grappled with weak oil prices, persistent budget deficits and a dearth of new export pipelines that left the landlocked province's crude building up in storage, resulting in the discount on Canadian heavy crude blowing out to record levels last year.

As a last resort, Alberta took the controversial step of curtailing oil production to help prop up prices and investing in railcars to move more crude to market, a move that earned approval from some cash-strapped producers in the province's dominant oil industry, and outrage from critics.

Announcing the date of the election in the oil industry's corporate hub Calgary on Tuesday, Notley emphasized her government's commitment to health and education and its efforts to revitalize Alberta's economy.

""Since the oil price collapsed I know these last few years have been scary for a lot of families and I have worked day and night with my team to fight this recession and bring our economy back,"" she told supporters.

Opinion polls suggest Notley could be the first one-term premier in Alberta's history, and cede power to opposition leader Jason Kenney of the United Conservative Party, a former top federal cabinet minister.

The UCP have been consistently ahead in the polls since last year. An Ipsos/Global News poll on Tuesday said 53 percent of Albertans would vote for the UCP if an election were held today, versus 35 percent for the NDP.

Notley criticized Kenney for recent allegations that he was involved in an ethically dubious campaign to discredit a rival in the UCP leadership contest in 2017.

Kenney has denied any wrongdoing, but some political analysts say the scandal will dog his party's election bid.

""If you add up the number of actual (UCP) party members to come out and publicly speak against Jason Kenney, this is significant,"" said Lori Williams, a political science professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University. ""But is it going to be enough to shift undecided voters? That remains to be seen.""

In light of the allegations, Notley and the NDP are likely to make issues of integrity, equality and trust a central part of their campaign, Williams said.

Kenney brushed off the scandal, saying his party would be focused on jobs, the economy and getting pipelines built.

""Are you better off than you were four years ago? That's the question Albertans will be asking when they choose their new government,"" he told reporters in Edmonton. ""The NDP has to resort to the politics of personal destruction because they cannot defend the worst economic record in modern Alberta history.""

94,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"The Conservative Party of Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dogwood, a B.C. environmental organization, is calling for a deeper examination of SNC-Lavalin's activities in British Columbia and a full inquiry to examine possible ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

While much of the province and the country was flabbergasted when Notley’s NDP won a commanding majority government from the PCs in 2015, Cournoyer said in hindsight there were political undercurrents that made sense given the outcome, notably a powerful mood for change. “We’d just seen incredible wealth in this province over the previous 10 years just disappear overnight, almost,” said Cournoyer, referring to the downturn in the oil industry. Albertans were in a state of shock, he said, wondering “where did all this lost opportunity go?” Economic unrest still figures in this year’s election, posing a danger for the NDP in that the mood for change could work against them this time. Alberta’s oil continues to be sold at a deep discount amid a glut of production and a lack of pipeline capacity.

The energy industry is always front and centre for Alberta voters, but anger over the economy has been sizzling. Talk of separating from Canada even reared its head this year, while equalization payments from the federal government drove a wedge between Alberta and Quebec, and a convoy of trucks drove across the country to Ottawa, in part, to protest the federal government’s perceived neglect of oilpatch workers. Lori Williams, a political science professor at Mount Royal University, said health care and education were top of mind four years ago. This time, the economy will dominate the conversation, particularly around building pipelines to take Alberta oil to tidewater in B.C. If 2019’s priorities could look more like they did four years ago, “I think that would be better for Rachel Notley,” Williams said. Leading up to the 2015 election, Cournoyer said voters perceived political leaders as arrogant and mischievous. The famous floor crossings, where nine Wildrose MLAs — including then-leader Danielle Smith — stepped over to the PC side, shook the electorate and stoked negative ideas about backroom deals. At the time, the Wildrose party was the official opposition, and when those MLAs defected to the PCs, it left the government with a whopping 72-seat majority, while the Wildrose and Liberals had just five seats each. Just a few months later, then-premier Jim Prentice called the election a year early, which left Notley “in the right place at the right time,” according to Cournoyer. The United Conservatives are at risk of a similar backlash this year, though. An investigation into financial contributions made during the party’s 2017 leadership race by Alberta’s election commissioner has been passed off to the RCMP, and Kenney’s leadership campaign has been plagued by allegations of illicit donations made to a rival, Jeff Callaway, in order to attack Kenney’s main opponent, former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean. The scandal came to a boiling point last weekend. The Star and several media outlets obtained leaked documents that allege Kenney was aware of Callaway’s kamikaze campaign from the beginning, and cast doubt on Kenney’s denials that he was involved. Then, on Monday, a report in Maclean’s magazine revealed allegations from a former Callaway staffer that the campaign was funded in part by a $60,000 payment from a corporate entity, which was redistributed to appear as if it came from several donors.

Kenney has denied any financial wrongdoing on his part and maintained that communication between campaign teams is normal. In 2015, voter sentiment was turning against the PC government, which was seen as entitled. Before the writ dropped, Prentice infamously said in a CBC interview that Albertans should “look in the mirror” to see who was responsible for the province’s financial issues, creating a sense that he was more aligned with corporate interests than everyday Albertans. While Albertans’ conservative roots run deep, the main right-leaning choice is very different than the past, Cournoyer says. The new UCP isn’t the same old Alberta PC party by another name. Its leader, Jason Kenney is a former MP who has brought some of his Ottawa team to the campaign, while Harper has backed Kenney’s leadership campaign. Those close ties to the federal conservative party show the UCP “is a different political beast.” The UCP is polling well, but Cournoyer said another lesson Albertans can learn from the 2015 election is that polls never tell the full story. “Polls are snapshots of what a certain group of people believe or how they feel at a certain time. It might not be how they feel the next day — it might not be how they feel a couple weeks later,” he said. The 2015 pre-election polls indicated the PCs were primed to sweep the province and win a majority, with the NDP trailing far behind. In the end, the NDP won 54 of 87 seats, while the Wildrose won 21, the PCs took 10, and the Liberal and Alberta parties won one each. With the shocking win by the NDP, Williams said it is important to remember this year that “campaigns count enormously.” The leaders’ election debate was a major turning point four years ago, with commentators roundly declaring Notley the clear winner. It also spurred heated criticism for Prentice as he criticized the NDP’s corporate tax plan by telling Notley, “I know that math is difficult.” Williams said voters often make their decision as the days dwindle in the campaign and election day approaches. She thought the routing of the dynastic PCs in 2015 may stick in voters’ memories, making them comfortable with the idea of ushering in new leadership again. “Those of us who like democracy hope that we don’t have dynastic successions anymore,” Williams said. “That’s been the history of Alberta, but we always wonder, ‘Well, is this going to be the election that breaks that trend?’” Kieran Leavitt is an Edmonton-based reporter.

Aryan Sadat said on Twitter on Monday night that 10 members of the Calgary North East UCP constituency association “are no longer a part of, and we no longer support the UCP party under Jason Kenney leadership.

“We believe in an all-inclusive political party that will act in the best interest of Albertans,” Sadat, who said he was a representative for the association though not a board member, said in a statement.

“I have terminated my membership with the UCP . . . and will no longer support Jason Kenney.”

The UCP issued a statement saying it “has not received individual resignations from any board members on the Calgary North East constituency association at this time, nor has the local constituency association president.”

The UCP says said Sadat “has no standing with the party or constituency association.”

“Mr. Sadat indicated last summer that he was wanting to run for a UCP nomination,” a statement reads. “He was subsequently informed that it was highly unlikely he’d pass UCP candidate screening due to his past, well-publicized issues,” referring to past criminal charges.

Sadat’s claim comes one week after several board members from the Livingstone-Macleod constituency association resigned.

Sadat, who said he was chosen to speak to the media, said discontent over various issues has been brewing for weeks, including the attraction of white supremacists to the UCP and Kenney’s comments on women being less tactical than men.

Revelations Calgary-Mountain View candidate Caylan Ford allegedly made social media comments in 2017 voicing sympathy for white supremacist thought and the dismissal of other board members’ resignations as sour grapes have also rankled, said Sadat.

But the latest scandal over the 2017 leadership race and Kenney’s refusal to admit fault was a major factor, he added.

“We still believe in presumption of innocence, but you’ve got to step up and take responsibility,” adding the board members who quit are immigrants.

“We didn’t come here to follow these kinds of politics . . . we live in Canada, not America.”

He said the board members still wish the party’s candidate in the riding, Rajan Sawnhey, well, but doesn’t know where she stands on the resignations.

Not all members of the board resigned, he added.

Documents published by CBC Saturday night and later obtained by Postmedia show regular communication between Kenney’s deputy chief of staff and a senior member of leadership candidate Jeff Callaway’s campaign manager, Cameron Davies.

Last month, Alberta’s election commissioner handed a $15,000 penalty to Davies for “obstruction of an investigation.”

The RCMP is investigating, though Kenney has denied all knowledge of a so-called Kamakazi campaign to discredit Jean

Kenney and Callaway have denied any political collusion between their campaigns.

You’d hope the Alberta NDP would be a light shining out of this mess, but no, it’s a thinly-disguised Conservative party anyway ...","Based on what we’ve learned in the past 24 hours, it’s hard to dispute Premier Rachel Notley’s blunt assessment at her nomination meeting in the Edmonton-Strathcona riding yesterday that Opposition Leader Jason Kenney has been coolly lying about the role of his 2017 leadership campaign in the so-called “Kamikaze Mission” to sink his rival to lead the opposition United Conservative Party.

Accusing Mr. Kenney of “a profound absence of integrity,” Premier Notley told more than 1,000 cheering supporters in Old Strathcona’s St. Basil’s Cultural Centre that leaked United Conservative Party documents reported by journalists over the weekend showed Mr. Kenney’s “denials were calm, cool, confident lies. Outright lies.”

“Mr. Kenney owes Albertans a full accounting, not just empty denials,” she stated.

Soon after she accepted the nomination by her son Ethan and addressed the packed meeting, Ms. Notley told reporters “the evidence that has come out and the memos that have come out make it pretty clear that on Friday, when Mr. Kenney … responded very calmly and coolly and confidently to those questions, that he was lying. He was absolutely lying.”

And so, inevitably, the ballot question for many Albertans in the election Ms. Notley will call soon will be, “Can Jason Kenney be trusted?”

Or, perhaps, to spin the same question another way,“What else can he not be trusted about.”

If this is so, it is not the question the UCP’s strategists would have wanted Albertans to be asking themselves.

The documents first reported by the CBC and now in the hands of other news organizations show Mr. Kenney’s victorious 2017 UCP leadership campaign and that of Jeff Callaway, the alleged Kamikaze Candidate, were effectively joined at the hip. The CBC reported that the Kenney crew gave the Callaway camp strategic direction, talking points, speech drafts, videos, and advertisements, “all aimed at undermining Kenney’s main political rival, Brian Jean.”

In her spirited remarks – a campaign speech in all but timing – Premier Notley sharply contrasted her NDP Government’s platform with promises made by Mr. Kenney.

“This election is about who is going to be premier,” she said. “It’s about the kind of province that we leave to our kids. And I say to all of you, that the choice could not be more stark.

“Mr. Kenney believes we are in a race to the bottom. The lowest corporate taxes, the worst environmental regulations, underfunded and overstressed public services, low wages, stressed out families desperately trying to make ends meet. Angry and divisive politics. Two Albertas.

“I believe that we are in a race to the top. I believe that good public schools give our kids the best start in life. I believe that good public health care is the foundation of a decent society. I believe that we can do the hard work of diversification to build an economy that works for everyone. And I believe Alberta is stronger when we stick together and take care of each other.

“Alberta is for all of us. One Alberta. Not just for the few, but for all of us. And, friends, I believe that Alberta’s best days are absolutely ahead, and that the politics of love, and hope, and optimism always trump the politics of anger, division and fear.”

On Mr. Kenney’s plan to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, she said: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.”

On his vow to cut minimum wages for young people: “All work has dignity no matter who does it. There are no second class citizens in Alberta.”

She poked fun at Mr. Kenney’s recent suggestion that male candidates “understand tactical politics a little bit better than women.” She has “an unladylike flair for tactical politics,” she observed, to laughter.

And she mocked the UCP’s vociferous recent demands that she call an election as soon as possible. “We’re getting clearer and clearer insight into why it was that the UCP was so hysterically calling for the writ to be dropped,” she told the reporters after her speech.

Either way, she said, the timing of the election will not be based on the strategic needs of the UCP. “If our election timing was driven by the calendar of investigation into Conservative criminal wrongdoing, then we would never have a campaign.”

Ms. Notley got some support yesterday from an unexpected quarter when former Kenney ally Derek Fildebrandt, a man once touted as the conservative most likely to play the role of the Kamikaze Candidate and now leader of the libertarian Freedom Conservative Party, told the CBC, “not everyone that brings forward an allegation is necessarily credible or telling the truth, but these are now backed up by hard evidence.”

“The documents released last night show clearly that it is not the whistle-blowers that have lied, but Jason Kenney,” he stated.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has brushed aside calls from former cabinet minister Jane Philpott to waive all cabinet and solicitor general privileges to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak freely about the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Ms. Philpott told Maclean’s magazine in an interview published on Thursday that Canadians need to know “the whole story” of what she called an “attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial” of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Philpott resigned earlier this month as President of the Treasury Board, citing a lack of confidence in the way the Prime Minister handled the SNC-Lavalin matter.

The political controversy has resulted in the resignations of four high-profile members of the Trudeau government and maneuvers by the opposition to disrupt Parliament in protest of a decision by the Liberal-dominated justice committee to shut down its inquiry into the matter.

Conservative MPs forced marathon votes on spending estimates Wednesday night that are expected to take up most of Thursday and force the cancellation of the Commons Question Period.

In testimony before the Commons justice committee last month, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top aides including the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, to grant a deferred prosecution agreement to the Montreal engineering and construction company.

The B.C. Liberal MP has said she wanted to return for a second round of testimony to explain what transpired between when she was moved out of the justice portfolio in early January and her resignation from cabinet on Feb. 11.

She has asked Prime Minister to give her another waiver from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to talk about conversations with Mr. Trudeau that led to her resignation from cabinet.

“If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories,” Ms. Philpott said. “My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole truth.”

At an event in Mississauga, Mr. Trudeau told reporters he already granted an unprecedented waiver to Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she could provide testimony about the political pressure she said was exerted between September and December 2018 to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

“The issue was pressure around SNC-Lavalin while she was attorney-general and she got to speak fully to do that,” Mr. Trudeau said in dismissing requests he allow her to speak about the period after she was shuffled out of Justice.

This week, the government has tried to shift the political focus from the SNC-Lavalin affair to the budget. The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the former attorney general to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout from The Globe report, Mr. Trudeau has lost the two ministers as well as his principal secretary, Gerald Butts. On Monday, Mr. Wernick retired as Canada’s top bureaucratic saying he has lost the “trust and respect"" of the opposition parties over his role in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

On Tuesday, Liberal MPs on the Justice committee shut down hearings on the SNC-Lavalin matter, preventing Ms. Wilson-Raybould from returning to testify.

Liberal MPs are also expected to use their majority on the House ethics committees on Thursday to block an attempt by Conservative and NDP members to mount an inquiry and have Ms. Wilson-Raybould testify.

In the Maclean’s interview, Ms. Philpott said she is also keen to have cabinet privileges waived so she could talk about a Dec. 6 meeting with the Prime Minister when they discussed his plans to shuffle Ms. Wilson-Raybould out of the post of justice minister and attorney-general.

“I spoke to the Prime Minister on January the 6th about SNC-Lavalin’s desire to have a DPA [deferred prosecution agreement],” she said. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister. … Why would I have felt that there was a reason why the former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled.”

Mr. Trudeau had a different interpretation of that meeting, saying it was about Ms. Philpott’s move from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board President and his plan to have Ms. Wilson-Raybould take over her portfolio.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her, ‘no it was not,’ ” he said. “She then mentioned it may be a challenge for Jody-Wilson Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services.”

Mr. Trudeau said he asked Ms. Philpott “for her help, and she gladly offered"" to help convince Ms. Wilson-Raybould to take the position. A former B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ms. Wilson-Raybould turned down the job because she did not want to oversee the Indian Act.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould was then shuffled to Veteran Affairs on Jan. 14, which she believed was related to her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

Ms. Philpott said Ms. Wilson-Raybould was subjected to “bullying or harassment” from the Prime Minister’s Office to overrule federal prosecutors and negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

“The former AG didn’t want to override that, and she had her finger in the dike and said no repeatedly,"" Ms. Philpott said.

In the aftermath of Ms. Philpott’s interview, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh renewed calls on Thursday for a judicial inquiry.

""Give us the independence of a judge that is not limited by a Liberal-dominated committee, where a judge has the independence to ask all witnesses all the questions necessary so Canadians can learn the truth,” he said. “If the Prime Minister was co-operative, the public inquiry would not take very long.

103,Business,2019-03-19T21:01:00.0000000Z,While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China ... Carbon pricing will be a core election issue and federal Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer is calling 2019 the “year of the carbon tax.” While such punchy messaging has certainly tested ...,"At the historic climate talks in Paris in 2015, countries agreed that large-scale transformation is required to avoid the worst effects of global temperature rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last year added more urgency to this message — countries have little more than a decade to keep global warming below 1.5°C.

Carbon pricing is globally recognized as a vital tool to reduce carbon emissions. While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China, Argentina and South Africa in implementing some form of carbon pricing mechanism in 2019, Canada’s federalist system poses a unique set of challenges.

Last month the Ontario government released the details of its carbon pricing plan for big emitters, which looks quite similar to the federal emissions trading system the province adamantly opposes. This was the most recent development from a provincial coalition — made up of the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick — opposed to the federal carbon pricing plan.

While provincial governments have employed a range of strategies to oppose the federal plan, influential industry players like the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have openly supported the federal carbon pricing system. Canadians are now spectators to a surprising matchup, with the federal government and a growing number of industry players facing off against defecting provinces.

It is difficult to imagine a scenario where Canada can meet its Paris Agreement target of reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 without an ambitious and effective carbon pricing mechanism. So how can we make sense of these two seemingly contradictory developments — provincial opposition yet (conditional) industry support for carbon pricing — and how will they affect the future of Canada’s price on carbon?

The federal carbon pollution pricing system became law last summer. The plan consists of two ‘backstops’: a carbon levy and a trading system for large emitters. The carbon levy (also known as a fuel charge) will apply to fossil fuel producers or distributors, starting at $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (C02e). This comes into effect in April 2019 for Saskatchewan, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick.

The second part of the federal plan — which came into effect on January 1 — is the trading system designed for large industrial emitters (those that emit 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year), known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). In this system, the government sets an emissions threshold for each sector; companies that emit below their annual limit receive credits and those that exceed the limit must either buy credits from other companies or pay the tax (which also starts at $20 per tonne). The OBPS came into effect in January for industry in Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and partially in Saskatchewan.

A price on carbon is not a silver bullet for Canada’s emissions reductions, nor was it intended to be. Although Canada is slipping further behind on its Paris targets, the federal carbon pricing system will still significantly reduce emissions. Last fall the government estimated that — once the planned provincial and territorial systems take effect and the federal backstop is applied — the system could cut carbon pollution across Canada by 50 to 60 million tonnes in 2022. According to the latest federal projections, with the carbon pricing backstop and other proposed measures, Canada will fall short of its 2030 target by 79 millions tonnes. Without these measures the gap increases to 164 million tonnes.

Applying the federal backstop will be no easy feat. The Ontario and Saskatchewan governments have launched legal cases against the federal government. The first legal case against the federal plan is already underway in Saskatchewan, with Ontario and New Brunswick intervening in favour of Saskatchewan (and British Columbia intervening in favour of the federal government). If the newly elected premier of New Brunswick, Blaine Higgs, makes good on his promise, and if Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party wins the Alberta spring provincial election, they could also file court cases. While Manitoba has yet to take legal action, Premier Brian Pallister unexpectedly announced last October that the government would abandon a planned carbon tax. Together these politicians are forming a new alliance against carbon pricing. Despite some variations in their positions — like Kenney’s indication that he would support the price for heavy emitters but reject the fuel charge — they are rallying together and supporting each other’s legal cases.",Redrawing the battle lines in the fight over Canada’s price on carbon,opencanada.org,https://www.opencanada.org/features/redrawing-the-battle-lines-in-the-fight-over-canadas-price-on-carbon/
104,Business,2019-03-20T20:51:00.0000000Z,"Canada’s next budget will look very familiar ... that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they ...","Canada’s next budget will look very familiar, with Justin Trudeau set to spend much of a revenue windfall and continued red ink in his government’s books.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.

Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.

A recent survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian non-profit independent research organization, showed that most Canadians (60 per cent) think the country’s birthright laws, which stipulate that anyone born in Canada is a citizen, must change.

article continues below

Among the respondents, 64 per cent believe children born to parents who are here on tourist visas should not be granted Canadian citizenship and 24 per cent said they should.

Meanwhile, 55 per cent of respondents said the citizenship should be given to a child if both of the parents are in Canada on work visas, and 40 per cent said kids from parents on student visas should be granted the citizenship.

When asked about the policy overall, 40 per cent said birthright is a good policy and 33 per cent said it is a bad one.

Opinions were also split on how serious this problem is, while 55 per cent said it is a very or quite serious issue and 44 per cent said it is not serious.

“Opponents of changing birthright citizenship rules say doing so is unnecessary because 'birth tourism' – while a phenomenon in some Canadian cities – particularly Richmond in B.C. – is not a serious enough problem nationwide to justify changing Canada’s citizenship rules,” stated the report.

The report added that how concerned people are about birth tourism appears to depend ""heavily"" on their age and political affiliation.

“Generationally, it is older Canadians (over 55 years old) who consider the issue more serious, while those under the age of 55 are evenly divided,” it stated.

""Similarly, two-thirds of Liberal- and NDP-inclined Canadians say that this is not a serious issue, while those considering the CPC (Conservative Party) say it is serious by a ratio of three-to-one.""

Half of Canadians are in favour of an overhaul of the whole system, whereas 28 per cent wanted only specific changes made to birth tourism policies.

A petition hosted by Richmond residents calling for the federal government to end birth tourism collected 11,000 across Canada and was presented in Parliament by Richmond MP Joe Peschisolido last October.

Birthright citizenship has also been a contentious issue in some other countries. The French changed their citizenship laws in 1993 to eliminate birthright citizenship, while Ireland followed suit in 2005 and more recently New Zealand and Australia. In these countries at least one parent must be a citizen for their child to automatically be a citizen.",Two thirds of Canadians support a change on birthright citizenship: Survey,Richmond News,https://www.richmond-news.com/news/two-thirds-of-canadians-support-a-change-on-birthright-citizenship-survey-1.23665592

""They're recognizing that the investment levels are down, they're recognizing that prices are down and that unemployment is up, and yet they're not really taking any meaningful action to support our industry,"" the group’s vice-president of oilsands, Ben Brunnen, said as quoted by CBC.

""The reality is, when we see those indicators all facing down, from an oil and gas perspective, and no recognition from the government of a willingness to support our industry, it's a pretty strong message towards our industry that we're not a priority for this government, and that's disappointing,"" Brunnen added.

The budget includes funds for retraining initiatives that could help with Alberta’s high unemployment problem, but according to CAPP, this is not enough.

Alberta’s oil industry may not be a priority for Ottawa, but it certainly is a priority for everyone running in this year’s elections, scheduled for April 16. The Canadian Press reported this week that oil and gas investments and carbon tax were central topics on the campaign trail.

Incumbent Premier Rachel Notley has promised to increase local oil and gas processing capacity while her rival from the United Conservative party, Jason Kenney, focused on the carbon tax approved by the Notley government.

Notley’s plan aims to reduce the amount of crude oil Alberta exports, therefore reducing the need for transportation capacity including pipelines—nowhere in sight—and oil trains. It should bring in tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments.

Kenney, on the other hand, promised his first order of business would be to repeal the carbon tax that is “punishing” Albertans. This, he said, would save the province more than US$1billion (C$1.4 billion) every year “in one fell swoop.”

Saskatchewan had the ...","Education, poverty and the environment are high on the list of budget priorities for Canadian high school students.

That’s according to the 2019 Student Budget Consultation, an annual survey of Canadian students conducted by CIVIX, a non-partisan charity dedicated to building political engagement among young adults. More than 8,000 high school students took part in this year’s survey, including 45 from the Prince Albert area.

Crime and fiscal responsibility rounded out the list of top five major concerns, but education was by far the one item students wanted to see supported in the federal budget, especially post-secondary education.

CIVIX content director Dan Allan said most students remain confident they’ll be able to find a job when they graduate. However, not all think they’ll be able to pay for the training and education needed to get one.

“Education is one of the results that we see really strongly this year, as an area that students think the government can really help them,” Allan explained. “Whether it’s lowering the cost of school or making debt a more manageable thing, (education) is a top thing which, for the group that’s taking the survey, makes a lot of sense.”

A total of 93 per cent of all students surveyed want the government to either increase spending on post-secondary education, or spend at least the same amount. Almost half of students, 48 per cent, say making student debt more manageable is the best thing the federal government could do to help young Canadians enter the workforce.

Post-secondary costs also topped the list of concerns when CIVIX asked about what steps the federal government should take to assist families. Roughly 35 per cent of students surveyed said the government should make post-secondary education more affordable and accessible. Lowering personal income taxes was the second highest response, with 27 per cent of students picking that option.

Although students are concerned about the need for more accessible education, most don’t want the government to break the bank to do it. Allan said students are very conscious of the Canadian debt, and are worried it‘s getting out of control. In fact, 72 per cent of students surveyed wanted the government to prioritize lowering the federal debt as much as possible.

“One of the things that students have told us is that they’re worried about is the amount of debt the government is taking on, that will have to be paid back when their older,” Allan said. “There is very much a mixture of concerns. They’re hoping the government spends now to help them, as well as wanting the government to be mindful of what they spend.”

While 92 per cent of students said they wanted the federal government to either spend the same or increase spending when it came to the environment, they remain fairly neutral on one of Canada’s most controversial issues: the federal carbon tax. Roughly 47 per cent of students surveyed said they are neutral about the federal government’s plan to implement the tax, with 35 per cent supporting it and 18 per cent opposing.

Students were also uncommitted about federal government support for struggling private media companies, with 49 per cent saying they’re neutral. Another Roughly 28 per cent say they oppose the federal government giving support to media organizations, while 22 per cent agree.

Roughly 400 Saskatchewan students responded to the survey, representing 43 of the province’s schools.

Saskatchewan and Alberta students were the most likely to support Canada’s oil and gas industry, however Saskatchewan students were also the most likely to agree with the statement “wealthy people have a greater financial obligation than everyone else to help those who are in need.”

The federal Conservatives and NDP were the parties Canadian students were most likely to support, with each party getting 31 per cent of the vote. The Liberals were next with 24 per cent of the vote, followed by eight per cent supporting the Green Party and five per cent supporting the People’s Party of Canada.

Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta were bastions of Conservative support, with students in all three provinces favouring them. Saskatchewan had the highest rate, with just under 50 per cent of students agreeing with the Conservatives. Students in B.C. gave by the strongest vote of confidence to the NDP, while students in Ontario and Atlantic Canada were more evenly divided across party lines.

Allan said there’s an assumption that most young people are less conservative than their parents, however this survey shows that’s not true on the prairies.

“It’s not really a surprise,” he said. “We never want to have any preconceived notions about where students are going to fall, but … what we find over the years is that nine times out of 10, students in a given area will vote along the same lines as adults do. We’ve done votes in Saskatchewan, both for the 2016 provincial election and the 2015 federal vote, and the results of students who took part pretty much lined up exactly (with the actual vote) in those cases, so it doesn’t surprise us that the results in these cases pretty much line up.”",Post-secondary costs highlight list of concerns in 2019 CIVIX Student Budget Consultation,Prince Albert Daily Herald,http://paherald.sk.ca/2019/03/18/post-secondary-costs-highlight-list-of-concerns-in-2019-civix-student-budget-consultation/

Opposition parties have been calling for the clerk of the Privy Council’s resignation since he first vehemently rejected allegations that he and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Wernick’s combative testimony to the House of Commons justice committee was denounced as partisan and unbecoming of a senior bureaucrat.

Also on Monday, the Liberals who make up a majority on that committee said publicly that they believe it has done all it can, or should, to investigate the affair.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, Wernick said he will retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off. He noted that the clerk is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign, as part of a new federal watchdog panel, and is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government — two roles he no longer believes he can fulfil.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” Wernick wrote. “I wish to relinquish these roles before the election. It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world-leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

Wernick, who has served in senior public service roles for nearly 38 years, has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould has accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t cave in to pressure last fall from Trudeau and his senior staff to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya. She has said they pushed her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would have forced the company to pay stiff penalties but let it avoid the risk of a criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about undue pressure only surfaced publicly after she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She resigned from cabinet a month later. Her exit was followed by the departure of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and then the resignation from cabinet of Jane Philpott, who cited loss of confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Wernick’s decision to quit as well proves “this SNC-Lavalin scandal is even bigger than we thought,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.

Trudeau said he intends to name Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace Wernick.

On his way into the House of Commons, Trudeau thanked the clerk for his “extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades” and credited his government’s accomplishments “definitely in large part” to Wernick’s leadership of the public service. Trudeau did not respond when asked if he’d sought Wernick’s resignation but his office later said he had not.

Wernick’s letter was released minutes before MPs reconvened for their first question period after a two-week March break, an exchange that proved explosive almost from the get-go.

Opposition members erupted in protest when Trudeau announced he’d appointed former Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan as a special adviser to explore what he called “important questions” about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice, who plays a dual role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

McLellan “will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation, of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,” the prime minister said in a statement. “She will consider whether machinery-of-government or legislative changes may or may not be recommended.”

“Her work will be another important step towards maintaining Canadians’ confidence in their institutions,” he told the Commons.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer mocked the announcement as nothing more than saying “Liberals will investigate Liberals.”

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus ridiculed the idea of a Liberal minister from the era of the sponsorship scandal looking into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which he dubbed “a five-alarm dumpster fire.”

As for Wernick, Angus professed no surprise at his decision to retire.

“I think once we saw how much of an active political player Mr. Wernick was in the SNC scandal, it became impossible for him to carry on his job, which is to have the trust of all parliamentarians on key matters of policy,” he said outside the Commons.

Angus also said Wernick should have “known better” in the way he presented himself before the justice committee, suggesting he was combative, evasive and partisan.

MPs on the committee were taken aback when he prefaced his initial testimony with a diatribe about the deteriorating tenor of political discourse, with incitements to violence that he said made him fear someone will be assassinated during the coming election campaign. He cited the example of a Conservative senator who’d urged truckers in a pipeline protest on Parliament Hill to “roll over every Liberal” in the country.

Wernick engaged in a number of testy exchanges with opposition MPs. In a second appearance, he suggested profane messages he received through the social media “vomitorium” after his first appearance amounted to witness intimidation.

The Liberal-dominated committee is to meet Tuesday to consider opposition demands to recall Wilson-Raybould. She has already testified for nearly four hours but has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation a month later.

But the five Liberals on the justice committee — Edmonton’s Randy Boissonault, Toronto-area MPs Iqra Khalid and Ali Ehassi, B.C.’s Ron McKinnon and Nova Scotia’s Colin Fraser — tipped their hand in an open letter to their fellow Liberal who chairs it, Anthony Housefather.

“The committee has heard from principal witnesses in this matter,” their joint letter says, including Wernick, Wilson-Raybould, and Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts. They’ve met for 13 hours of testimony over 11 meetings, it says, and “Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, perspectives and relevant legal principles … As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

McLellan’s work and a separate investigation by the federal ethics commissioner will complete the picture, the letter says.

In the Commons, Trudeau himself likewise argued that the committee has been meeting for five weeks and has heard “all perspectives.” He suggested further inquiry should be left to the federal ethics commissioner.",Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick to quit before election in wake of SNC-Lavalin scandal,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/privy-council-clerk-michael-wernick-retires-in-wake-of-snc-lavalin-scandal

Yes, we are all aware that Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was lobbying Trudeau’s inner circle hard in order to secure a deferred prosecution agreement, rather than face a possible criminal conviction for bribery charges.

In turn, Wilson-Raybould has testified before the Commons justice committee that Trudeau’s top aide, Gerald Butts, and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick pressured her on this file. Their argument was that a criminal conviction would preclude SNC-Lavalin from bidding on future federal government tenders. Should that occur, SNC-Lavalin executives had suggested they would fold up their headquarters tent in Montreal, and 9,000 skilled jobs would vanish from the Canadian landscape. This would, of course, not sit well with voters in an election year.

The allegations of political interference in this case have made this a decidedly Liberal Party scandal, with the Conservative opposition circulating petitions urging Trudeau to resign.

Upon closer examination, however, the actual accusations of SNC-Lavalin having bribed their way into lucrative Libyan construction contracts spans the period of 2001 to 2011. During that decade it is alleged that SNC-Lavalin representatives paid an estimated $48 million in bribes to members of the Gadhafi family.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect Saadi Gadhafi, the former Libyan president’s third-eldest son. That protection by Garda is alleged to have included some $30,000 worth of prostitutes and tickets to a Spice Girls concert.

The timeframe also puts this sordid affair back onto the Harper Conservatives. Fast forward to the spring of 2011 and the start of the Libyan uprising. At that juncture, no doubt thanks in part to the $48 million in palm grease paid to the Gadhafi family, SNC-Lavalin had secured billions of dollars’ worth of construction in Libya. Heck, they were even in the process of building a big new jail for the very president we were now labelling as a bloodthirsty despot.

Foreign affairs minister John Baird was among the loudest and most bellicose of western voices demanding that Gadhafi must go.

To help make that happen, Canada was among the first countries to participate in the NATO air campaign aimed at destroying the Gadhafi loyalist forces.

It took a hell of a lot longer than anyone would have imagined for the world’s most sophisticated air armada to defeat a fourth-rate African army, but by early October 2011, the end was clearly nigh. The last of the Gadhafi loyalists were contained alongside their embattled leader in the town of Sirte.

On Oct. 11, 2011, a full nine days before Libyan rebels would capture and murder Gadhafi, Baird made a secret visit into the rebel held Libyan capital of Tripoli. During that whirlwind trip, Baird met with and praised several of the Libyan rebel leaders and he announced Canada’s commitment of $10 million to secure Libyan weapons once the war was finally won.

Travelling with Baird were a number of Canadian business executives, including representatives from SNC-Lavalin, eager to start a new round of lucrative Libyan projects under the new post-Gadhafi leaders. Keep in mind that at this point Gadhafi was still alive and fighting.

So, if we are to believe that paying bribes to corrupt Third World leaders in order to obtain contracts is criminal nature, how do we define using military force to effect regime change, and then bringing in the carpet-baggers to profit from the puppet regime which we installed next?

The only problem with the Libyan caper was that Baird and company failed to listen to ambassador Sandra McCardell. She was with Baird in Tripoli as he used that same visit to reopen our embassy.

Her prophetic statement to the Canadian Press at that time was that getting the guns out of the hands of young, heavily armed rebels would be the best way for Canada to contribute to Libya’s post-Gadhafi reconstruction. That’s right, the best way to help Libya would be for us to disarm the rebels we had armed.

Baird never did say just how his $10 million in pledged funding would actually secure the Libyan arsenals, but suffice it to say whatever he had planned failed miserably.

Once Gadhafi was dead, the various rebel groups, Islamic extremists, human traffickers and tribal thugs began fighting among themselves. Libya quickly plunged into a failed state of violent anarchy, where it remains to this date.

The Trudeau Liberals tried to avert a possible criminal conviction for SNC-Lavalin’s alleged bribery. That’s bad.

Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers ...,"Seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be doing regularly inside caucus.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson. Singh's first words as an elected ...","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made history Monday as he asked his first questions to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered an emotional clarion call Monday as he urged people of all political stripes to turn the page on hateful ideology and condemn the sort of intolerance that fuelled the brutal killing of 50 Muslims in New Zealand.

A visibly angry Trudeau denounced the “small, toxic segments” of society that peddle the belief diversity is a weakness, spewing hatred and inciting brutality.

“We see it here in Canada — in online harassment, anonymous letters, defaced places of worship, acts of violence and even murder,” he told the House of Commons as party leaders expressed solidarity with the victims in Christchurch and their families.

“When we fail to denounce hatred with total conviction, we empower those people and legitimize their violence.”

Trudeau expressed sorrow at the many attacks in recent years that have taken the lives of defenceless people at mosques, temples, churches, synagogues, concerts, schools and malls.

“I’m sick and tired of extending our thoughts and our prayers. People around the world are exhausted by the carnage,” he said.

“We have to chase out this hatred from our parties, fight it online, denounce it at town halls, push back when it reaches our front door.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined Trudeau in stressing the need to condemn all racist ideologies and doctrines of prejudice.

Canada has, from its inception, been a country built on values that transcend religious, ethnic and linguistic divides, Scheer said. “This is who we are, and this is who we will always be. Those who think otherwise have no place in our democracy.”

In his maiden speech to the Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the use of dehumanizing language and making immigration out to be a threat can breed fear and fuel hatred.

“Let’s open our hearts and replace the ignorance, the lack of knowledge with understanding, which will create the climate for compassion, so we care for one another,” he said.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested Friday’s deadly mass shooting, which killed 50 people and wounded 50 more as they gathered at a pair of Christchurch mosques, will spur parliamentarians to take a careful look at Canada’s gun laws.

The massacre has sparked a global sense of concern that will prompt Canadian politicians to make some timely decisions, Goodale said Monday after appearing before a Senate committee.

Goodale said cabinet colleague Bill Blair will deliver recommendations soon, having been asked last August by Trudeau to study the possibility of a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada.

A visibly galvanized Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, said her government plans to announce gun-law reforms within days.

A bill already before Canada’s Senate would, among other things, expand the scope of background checks on those who want to acquire guns here.

The bill would also require gun retailers keep records of firearms inventory and sales, and ensure the purchaser of a hunting rifle or shotgun presents a firearms licence, while the seller would have to verify it.

Not Michael Wernick in particular, though it’s his Monday resignation and the events that led up to it that make the subject particularly timely, according to one expert.

What ought to happen now, said leading public administration scholar Donald Savoie, is a debate about what the role of the clerk should look like. Not only is the clerk the head of the federal public service. He or she is also secretary to the cabinet, and deputy minister to the prime minister.

“I think what we’ve seen since 1992 is clerks walking around with three hats,” said Savoie. “And I think the role of the clerk has been tilted in more recent years to that of deputy minister to the prime minister. Not in a politically partisan way, but in a partisan way of favouring the position of prime minister, and I think that’s the issue.”

Thus, Savoie explained, you get a situation such as the SNC-Lavalin Affair.

The director of public prosecutions, “a career public servant,” decides against pursuing a deferred prosecution agreement for embattled Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Rather than supporting the director’s decision, as Savoie believes Wernick should have done, the clerk and officials from the prime minister’s office repeatedly raised the potentially negative consequences of this course of action with then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

“The head of the public service represents the values and the views of the public service and I think it’s incumbent upon the clerk to tell the prime minister what he ought to do for the good of the country, what he ought to do for the good of criminal justice, the rule of law, for the economy,” said Savoie. As he sees it, Wernick did not fulfil this responsibility, though he notes his belief that the clerk was not driven by political partisanship to his self-described “lawful advocacy” in support of a DPA.

“If Trudeau had been a Conservative, I suspect Michael Wernick would have done the same thing.”

What the clerk appeared to influenced by, according to Savoie, was the third hat — “the hat that says you’re deputy minster to the prime minister, and … go around and fix things for the prime minister.”

This, then, appears a particularly appropriate time to have a conversation about the clerk’s tripartite roles, he said.

Karl Salgo, executive director of public governance and institutions at the Institute on Governance, also noted that Wernick’s decision to resign underscores the significance of his position’s retaining political neutrality.

“When the clerk becomes the subject of partisan controversy, it makes it very challenging for him to serve in his role,” Salgo explained. Rather than an admission of wrongdoing or partisanship, the resignation was the logical consequence of a breakdown in trust between the leader of the non-partisan public service and the opposition parties who may end up having to work with the clerk during a transition to government following the fall election, said Salgo.

“The idea of a politically-neutral public service is that you have to be able to serve successive governments of whatever political stripe … An opposition party has to feel like, ‘If we took over tomorrow, we could be credibly served by the public service because it doesn’t have partisan sentiments.’ Once there’s that kind of accusatory environment where mutual trust and respect is lost, those circumstances … have been compromised.”

Chris Aylward, the Public Service Alliance of Canada’s national president, said it’s up to Canadians to decide whether Wernick’s role in the SNC-Lavalin affair has tarnished the reputation of the federal public service as professional and non-partisan.

“I watched it, and I don’t think so,” said Aylward. Wernick has had a long public service career, he noted, “and I think if he feels it’s time to retire, then I wish him all the best.”

What Aylward did mention, however, was a past clash between the union and the clerk over then-auditor general Michael Ferguson’s characterization last summer that the public service was suffering from a broken culture, laid bare by the Phoenix pay system disaster. The clerk vehemently rejected the AG’s position, and PSAC, “totally disagreed with the clerk on that issue,” said Aylward.

“I’m hopeful that the replacement, the new clerk will understand that his role as the top public servant in the country is to make sure that the public service is served well by the government.”

Savoie, for his part, was enthusiastic about the prime minster’s replacement for Wernick — deputy minister of foreign affairs Ian Shugart. “He’s a career public servant. Stays away from politics. I’ve only heard good things about him,” Savoie said.

His appointment will serve as a signal to bureaucrats “that the government values the professional, non-partisan public service — because Ian represents precisely those values.”

(The Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick)

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled his fourth budget in Ottawa today, an election-year measure that not only plays up the positive effect Liberal policy has had on the economy — especially the historically low unemployment numbers — but, perhaps more importantly, primes voters who will head to the polls this year.

One thing this budget — which announces $23 billion in new spending — does not do is eliminate the deficit, which the Liberals promised they would do away with by their fourth budget. The fact that they missed this target by $23 billion sends a clear signal that they’re comfortable with running deficits going forward.

Goodies for Middle Age and Older Canadians

Though the big news was a scheme to help millennials buy their first home, there were several measures that were clearly aimed at older Canadians:

The government will create the Canadian Drug Agency whose role will be the creation of a national drug plan somewhere down the road, likely before the election. (Trudeau first hinted at the possibility of a national pharmacare plan during an August 2018 interview with Zoomer magazine in which he unequivocally promised “It’s coming.”)

in which he unequivocally promised “It’s coming.”) Changes to the Guaranteed Income Supplement program will allow older low-income Canadians to earn $1,500 more (raised from $3,500 to $5,000) before their benefit is clawed back

$50 billion for a National Dementia Strategy.

A $1.7 billion initiative that will offer money to middle-age Canadians to retrain for new job skills. They will also be able to hang on to their current jobs even if they leave for re-training

Introduction of new measures, possibly changing federal law, to protect pensioners of companies that go bankrupt

CARP’s initial reaction to the budgetary measures aimed at older Canadians was very positive — it seemed many were drawn directly from it’s national advocacy platform The Faces of Canada’s Seniors. “We’ve been calling for significant changes to safeguard Canadians as we age,” said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CARP’s Chief Public Policy Officer. “The government has listened.”

There was plenty of pre-budget drama today. Before Morneau had finished lacing up his new budget-day shoes, the Conservatives threatened to delay the release of the document in protest to the Liberal’s refusal to recall Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify at the House Justice Committee looking into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

At a press conference earlier in the day, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer raised the possibility that his party planned to disrupt Morneau’s attempt to table the budget by slowing down a vote (on an unrelated matter) in the House of Commons.

“Justin Trudeau shut down the justice committee investigation into his corruption scandal. If he expects us to quietly accept a cover-up, he will get a rude awakening this afternoon,” Scheer said.","Federal Budget 2019: Morneau Offers Lots of Goodies For Middle-Age, Senior Canadians",Everything Zoomer,http://www.everythingzoomer.com/general/2019/03/19/budget-2019-gis-training-pharamcare/

Members of his party tried not to laugh as he addressed the situation and you can’t blame them for wanting to. It’s kind of hilarious to think of our country’s leader sneaking chocolate into the House of Commons.

Unfortunately for Trudeau, the House of Commons doesn’t permit food or eating. In fact, the Decorum states that members are permitted to “refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.”

The voice of the first people is not only in print, media or communications that are discernible by mainstream measurements. The voice of the first people is the land. The voice of the first people is the water. The voice of the first people stretches centuries back to our creation stories. It is a voice that resounds with power and strength on this land.

When Jody Wilson Raybould evoked the words of the true Indigenous laws of this land, these words resonated into the cosmos. Initial reactions from Mainstream media were the incredulity at what Wilson Raybould shared with the justice committee. Very quickly, global media sources were quoting this event.

An Indigenous woman, originally from the west coastal people was delivering in the Canadian House of Commons a lesson on what the “rule of law” actually meant. She did not get this understanding from her undergrad or degree from mainstream institutions. Jody Wilson Raybould reminded the world and herself that the original laws and teachings of her own people are instilled within her own blood memory and DNA.

Global media focused on the past corruption of a global corporate actor, the placement of deferred prosecution agreement, or remediation agreement in an omnibus bill, and the unwillingness of a Liberal cabinet to lose footing or seats in the province of Quebec.

The corruption of a Liberal or Conservative government is not something new to the First Nations or people like Jody Wilson Raybould have had to encounter. In 2012, the Conservative sitting federal government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper put forth an omnibus bill where they attacked the protection of waters and also, hidden in this legislation was also an amendment to land surrenders or designations on reserve. But Harper’s Bill C-38 had one positive outcome. It united the indigenous people in Canada and launched the IdleNoMore movement.

Similarly, with Jody Wilson Raybould, there is an “indigenous take” on her testimony. The most important factor was not the fact that the Liberals were guilty of some serious corporate cronyism. The most important factor was that after 152 years, a sitting member of the white Canadian parliament had not followed the rule of whiteman made law. Jody Wilson Raybould quoted her own experiential learning, the laws of the Big House and her position as a matriarch and truth-teller.

This action by Jody Wilson Raybould was heard, not only by the Indigenous people throughout this land called Canada; the land, itself, heard her words. Our ancestors are in this land. The relationship between the Indigenous and the land is absolute. Repeated attempts to explain the spiritual significance and cosmic connection that the original people have in this territory falls deafly on mainstream ears.

The Indigenous “anthropomorphize” tangible objects. Mainstream sees a tree and a specific land area in monetary terms. The Indigenous sees the same tree, but they see the places where our people took shade or sheltered. The Indigenous know the place name and the stories of this place and the power that still lives. The difference in our memories and the difference in our history, means the application of law will be different for the Indigenous and the non-native who are guests in this land.

This is the conflict between Mainstream and the Indigenous. This is why there can be no reconciliation. For the Indigenous to reconcile, they have the option of assimilating into the larger society and becoming “equal” to the non-native so that they can finally take up their roles as “Canadians”. The indigenous must come to see the tree as just a tree with a price tag or a value attached.

If the Indigenous cannot see this tree like a commodity, they have a second option. This option is to maintain their Indigenous teachings and understanding and to go forward until the larger society begins to reconcile their view with our understanding.

Jody Wilson Raybould has opened this doorway. Only after the initial fray, mainstream media began to write that Jody’s words returned her to her teachings as a Kwakwaka’wakw person.

Therefore the heart of democracy and the noble action Jody Wilson Raybould took in not acquiescing to party pressure came from who she is as a person. Integrity cannot be taught. Integrity must come from within and must be supported by the systems that exist around a person.

In the Indigenous systems, there is respect for all life, because the Indigenous understand the Creator, the Great Mystery has made all things. There is no hierarchy of animals, rocks or water, there is only existence and co-existence. In this system, if you value or respect the land, the waters, the animals, the plants and all things, you have innate respect before any other measurable.

Where is the integrity in the non-native system? With technology, humans separate themselves from each other and from the natural world. With this separation, there is no connection, no reminder and no awe for the wonders of this world. Within the mainstream system, there are false examples of integrity like returning a lost wallet. If there is money involved, and money is measured, then there is integrity in this action.

When the newcomers to this land begin to operate in a system of interconnected understanding, they too will begin to understand what integrity means. It is standing at the edge of headwaters, looking at the mountains and seeing a line of shadowed ancestors, praying and resting in the foothills. It is in seeing a grizzly bear show its young how to push over trees in an area that has always been where the grizzlies go to dance. It is returning to the places where salmon swim against the current to reach their destination with determination and glory. It is in the comforting winds that gently rock babies to sleep in their swings. All these things do not cost and have no “apparent” monetary value. The value is in the eternal song of life that continues because of the respect, the integrity and the love each part shares for the other.

In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

It is fascinating to me that my beautiful little boy came out wanting and enjoying things that were traditionally associated with girls. His favorite colors are pink and red; he loves ballet; adores Wonder Woman and loves when his nails are painted. He also loves Batman, leaping off of tall furniture, and taking apart anything mechanical or electrical to find out how it works. When he told me he wanted to take ballet lessons at 2 1/2 years old (he refused the hip hop and jazz rock classes that were offered to the boys) my heart gushed at him being another Baryshnikov.

So at 3 years old when he wanted to wear bright pink to daycare and dress up as Wonder Woman for Halloween, my pride was overwhelming, but so was my fear. How would he be received? Could I protect him from sideways glances, mean whispered comments, or outright rude stares?

His daycare at the time had a narrow dressing area, so in the winter time, kids would undress from snow pants and boots practically shoulder to shoulder on a narrow bench. I almost cried in dismay at the father who moved his little boy away, glaring at me and sliding him off the bench when he saw the pink baby girl doll my son went everywhere with. I undressed my son less quietly that day, laughing and singing songs with him to make sure he didn’t notice anything was amiss.

Now, three years later, he has had three more birthdays and two Halloweens, all of them as Wonder Woman — from the long, flowing black wig to the red boot covers and sparkle-filled dress. He takes apart remote control cars and trucks to see how they work, and emphatically insists The Sound of Music is THE BEST MOVIE EVER. He asked me if boys wear dresses or skirts, having heard from some girls at school that they don’t. I replied, “Yes, they do!” and proceeded to show him pictures online of kilts and dashikis worn by big, brawny men.

Out of curiosity, I asked him one day if he felt he was a boy or a girl. He looked at me askance and said, “Of course I’m a boy!” He seemed so disgusted with the question, as if it was so obvious. It made me proud thinking that to him, it didn’t matter what he liked or what he wore, that his masculinity was perfect the way it was.

I worry. Every parent does. I worry about the bullies and the parents and the comments and the older more conservative members of the family and women who said that my husband and I were “so brave” to put him in ballet, and I wonder if he will be as hurt by all of it as I am for him. But when he asks to put on a dress, or paint his nails to go to school, or wear his Wonder Woman costume to a friends’ party, I comfort myself with the thought that he must (hopefully) be OK. He is still his own person and makes those choices. So I guess that’s good enough for me.

And he is still in ballet, but last year asked to change to a real ballet school. He dances and follows so attentively, and hugs me so tightly after each class, his face bursting with joy. It seems that maybe, just maybe, I might get my Baryshnikov after all.

123,Politics,2019-03-21T18:00:00.0000000Z,"The Democratic Party of the past half-century has been defined ... So it’s no wonder that, given all the talk of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, some Democrats are once again pleading ...","All of this leads many to conclude that a simple calculus governs political power in America: When Democrats move to the center, they win; when they move to the left, Republicans do. So it’s no wonder that, given all the talk of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, some Democrats are once again pleading for moderation.



Perhaps thinking of his own battle with Ted Kennedy, Carter has counseled Democrats to focus on independents rather than progressives. “Independents need to know they can invest their vote in the Democratic Party,” Carter told an audience at his presidential library in September, going on to caution that consequences would follow were they to “move to a very liberal program, like universal health care.” Although the party picked up 40 seats in a landslide midterm election, the amount of attention given to new progressive policies, like Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, Sanders’s Medicare for All, and Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax and anti-trust plans, continues to make Democrats apprehensive.



“We’re caught in a lose-lose because the activists are completely paying attention to Alexandria. And so if we aren’t supporting it, then we’re seen as bad Democrats,” Hill, the Democratic congresswoman from California, told Politico. “But if we do support it, then that’s going to be damaging to our campaigns.”



What’s the solution to this bind? Delaware Senator Chris Coons told The New York Times it was to be “hopeful, optimistic, positive.” Third-term Pennsylvania Congressman Brendan Boyle said “there’s still lots of folks on our side who are O.K. with compromise,” pointing to the many center-left Democrats who won seats in the midterm elections. Above all, the answer appears to be to keep quiet about specifics, as Beto O’Rourke has done, distancing oneself from universalist programs like Medicare for All and instead speaking in vague generalities about access and affordability. A fear of appearing too liberal has led these and other Democrats to be wary of standing for anything.



But the Democratic Party is moving left, whether they like it or not. Forty-six percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters now identify as “liberal,” up from just 28 percent a decade ago. At the same time, the percentage of people identifying as “moderates” has fallen from 44 to 37. When Obama was elected, one could accurately describe the Democratic base as being moderate, but that’s no longer true anymore. As The Atlantic’s David Graham wrote last year, registered Democrats have become more liberal on immigration, economics, and race over the same period. Increasing taxes on the rich, Medicare for All, and a jobs guarantee all poll well today.



Democrats did not gain their current momentum by being timid, but by relentlessly criticizing the president and advancing bold new ideas. Trump is the most consistently unpopular president in recent American history, and is underwater in the polls in key primary states. His approval rating may worsen yet after special counsel Robert Mueller releases his report and House Democrats’ investigations begin to bear fruit.

Sanders recently refused to label Venezuela’s current president, Nicolas Maduro ...","U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday said he is hiring a well-known liberal journalist with a history of sharply criticizing other Democratic presidential candidates, including Beto O’Rourke.

Sanders’ campaign said it is bringing in David Sirota, whose work has appeared in The Guardian and Newsweek, among other outlets, as a senior adviser and speechwriter.

The move could stoke tensions within the Democratic field since Sirota has previously targeted O’Rourke, a former U.S. congressman from Texas who entered the presidential race last week, and other rivals.

Sirota on Twitter and in published articles has accused O’Rourke of siding with President Donald Trump and Republicans while a member of the House of Representatives, as well as being overly friendly with the oil and gas industry.

Sirota’s criticism of O’Rourke in December drew a warning from Neera Tanden, a top ally of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and president of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank.

“A supporter of Bernie Sanders attacking a Democrat,” Tanden tweeted. “This is seriously dangerous. We know Trump is in the White House and attacking Dems is doing Trump’s bidding.”

The conflict was a reminder of the bad blood between the Clinton and Sanders camps when they battled for the Democratic nomination ahead of the 2016 presidential race and the mistrust between the party’s moderate and progressive wings.

Sirota also has slammed presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, as well as former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, for being overly cozy with corporate interests.

Sanders’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Sirota’s hiring.

Sirota worked for Sanders as a press secretary when Sanders was a member of the House of Representatives in the early 2000s.

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

READ MORE: Oil producers want to see policies that will double industry’s growth in Alberta election

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

WATCH: UCP leads NDP ahead of 2019 Alberta election

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 per cent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 per cent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

READ MORE: Notley kicks off election Day 2 with vow to double Alberta’s oil and gas incentives

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

Scandal brewing

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jeff Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

READ MORE: Pipeline politics to affect economy, two elections in 2019, economists say

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University.

Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

WATCH: Jason Kenney responds to Caylan Ford’s resignation from UCP race

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”",Canada’s battered oil industry cheering for Alberta’s opposition party in upcoming election,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5079770/oil-industry-alberta-2019-election/

128,World,2019-03-17T20:57:00.0000000Z,A new Gallup poll found “liberal Democrats ... of Turning Point USA urge blacks to divorce themselves from the Democratic Party. She calls this movement “Blexit.” Can we expect a similar ...,"Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., denies that anti-Semitism is “on the rise” within the Democratic Party.

He’s right.

This is not a recent phenomenon. Anti-Semitism within the Democratic Party has been on the rise for some time.

Democrats failed to pass a resolution specifically condemning freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a Muslim and naturalized citizen from Somalia, who recently made several comments considered anti-Semitic. She tweeted that American politicians support Israel because “it’s all about the Benjamins,” meaning Jews essentially offer bribes for political support.

She accused politicians who support Israel of dual loyalty. In 2012, she tweeted, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”

Following the “Benjamins” tweet, the Anti-Defamation League’s national director and CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, issued the following statement: “As Americans and Jews, we expect our politicians to condemn bigotry, not to fuel it. Words matter. At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in the U.S. and abroad, Rep. Omar is promoting the ugly, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics. The notion that wealthy Jews are controlling the government is a longstanding anti-Semitic trope and one of the pillars of modern anti-Semitism, a retread of ideas spread by bigots from David Duke to Louis Farrakhan.”

Omar, fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., are the only members of Congress to publicly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which “works to end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law.”

Criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism are, of course, not necessarily the same thing. But Omar pushes a stereotype that Jews have a dark, even sinister effect on the political process.

Jewish bigotry from black liberals — and Omar is black — has long been an unspoken problem among Democrats.

According to an annual survey commissioned by the ADL, their latest 2017 report found that blacks, who vote 90% for Democrats, were 2.3 times more likely than whites to be anti-Semitic. By contrast, polls show that Jews, among various demographic groups, are the least likely to be racist against blacks.

Consider: Rev. Jesse Jackson, when running for president in 1984, referred to Jews as “Hymie” and New York City as “Hymietown.”

Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, who once posed with then-Sen. Barack Obama in a photograph (helpfully not released until after President Obama left office), called Judaism a “gutter religion,” praised Hitler as “a great man” and recently said: “When they call me an anti-Semite — stop it. I’m anti-termite.”

Rev. Al Sharpton, whose endorsement is being sought by 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, referred to Jews as “diamond merchants” and helped fuel a 1991 riot between blacks and Jews in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn.

Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., a critic of American support of Israel, served two stints in Congress, from 1997 to 2003 and then from 2005 to 2007. Her father, a state representative for Atlanta, was asked on television, days before his daughter was defeated in a 2002 primary, why she faced such intense opposition. He said: “That ain’t nothing. Jews have bought everybody. Jews. J. E. W. S.”

Even Jews who do not support many Israeli policies nevertheless support the state of Israel.

A recent poll by the Jewish Electorate Institute found 92% of American Jews are “generally pro-Israel,” even as 59% say they are comfortable supporting Israel and also criticizing its government. But support for Israel is down among Democrats, particularly young Democrats.

A new Gallup poll found “liberal Democrats are only party/ideology group not partial to Israel” in the Mideast conflict. Young liberal Democrats are about as likely to support the Palestinians as they are Israel, with black support for Israel even lower.

A recent Economist/YouGov poll that asked whether Israel is an American “ally” found that only 19% of blacks and 22% of Hispanics agreed.

Young blacks like Candace Owens of Turning Point USA urge blacks to divorce themselves from the Democratic Party. She calls this movement “Blexit.”

Can we expect a similar movement in which Jewish voters reconsider their traditional 70% support for the Democratic Party?

Some call it Jexodus.

130,Politics,2019-03-21T17:56:00.0000000Z,"Leaders of the new left have a tricky 2020 objective: taking down Joe Biden. The former vice president insists he’s one of them. “I have the most progressive record of anybody running,” he said last week at a Democratic Party dinner in Delaware ...","Leaders of the new left have a tricky 2020 objective: taking down Joe Biden.

The former vice president insists he’s one of them. “I have the most progressive record of anybody running,” he said last week at a Democratic Party dinner in Delaware, his home state, before quickly clarifying that he hadn’t yet decided to run for president.

But to the progressives driving the party toward a younger and ideologically purer end, that wasn’t what screamed out for a correction. Biden, 76, has a long history of Senate votes and public statements and bipartisan friendships at odds with their movement — a movement that is expected to play a significant role in the Democratic primaries.

“A lot of people have a fondness toward Joe Biden because of his time in the Obama White House,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party. “That’s quaint and nice. People owe him a fondness. Now this is primetime, and he wants to put his hat in the ring to be the person who has the nuclear codes, the person who is going to transform our country after Trump has brought all this disarray. So there’s going to be a great deal of new scrutiny placed on his record, and there should be.”

Already in the months-long run-up to his anticipated campaign, Biden has expressed regret for supporting anti-crime legislation that disproportionately punished minorities and for his dismissiveness toward Anita Hill’s sexual harassment accusations against Clarence Thomas during Thomas’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. There also have been reminders of how he opposed school integration 45 years ago and of his eulogy for Strom Thurmond, who rose to political prominence as a segregationist. More recently he found himself on the defensive after calling Vice President Mike Pence, who’s known for pushing anti-gay policies, a “decent guy.”

Biden often tops polls of the Democratic field and would enter the race as the early frontrunner. Mitchell and other liberal activists who spoke to BuzzFeed News are preparing to make sure he peaks on announcement day by emphasizing the parts of Biden’s record they find insufficiently progressive. At the moment, their plans are vague promises and warnings that they will raise objections publicly. It’s less clear how coordinated these efforts might be, or if they’ll have enough money to make much of a dent. And there’s some disagreement over how big of a threat Biden really is.

“I think there’s going to be a lot less air in the room than it looks like for Biden,” said Charles Chamberlain, who chairs Democracy for America, the group that grew out of Howard Dean’s presidential campaign 15 years ago. “The reality is that Biden’s time is passed.”

That kind of confidence worries Sean McElwee, cofounder of the Data for Progress think tank and purveyor of the ""Abolish ICE"" rallying cry that has electrified many Democrats.

“The problem is that progressives are overestimating how much this will hurt him,” he said. “I see Biden as the Democratic Trump. He has a pretty strong lead in the polls. He’s not really someone who anyone in the party elite is most excited for. Everyone just sort of believes that all this baggage he has will ‘hashtag’ cancel him from the race. Maybe. Possibly. But the governor of Virginia also had a blackface scandal, and no one talks about that anymore.”

McElwee is emerging as one of Biden’s most strident critics on the left: “does joe biden have a long track record of progressive policy? no,” he tweeted this week. “does joe biden spend every day working to atone for decades of enabling racist, sexist and pro-corporate policies? also no.”

A Biden spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally who holds his old Senate seat in Delaware, emphasized Biden’s past efforts on climate change and his support for LGBTQ rights in an interview with BuzzFeed News. (Biden and many other Democrats in the 1990s voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. As vice president, Biden famously got out ahead of Obama and to announce his support for marriage equality.)

“If folks want to get into fights over votes he cast 30 and 40 years ago and ignore things that President Trump literally said or did yesterday, and the ways in which Joe Biden is the right person to look forward and pull us into a better future as a country, that’s their prerogative,” said Coons, who plans to endorse Biden if he runs. ""But I don’t think that’ll work in the end.”

Even as he asserts that he’s the most progressive 2020 hopeful, Biden does not shy away from his more centrist tendencies. He wasn’t happy about having to walk back the Pence compliment and has at times sounded incredulous over the notion that his relationships with Republicans could be seen as anything other than assets. His allies cite this crossover appeal when arguing that he is the most electable Democrat, the best positioned to beat Trump.

Through his think tank, McElwee plans to conduct a poll that examines whether a Biden-versus-Trump election will turn off “the next generation of voters.” The data, which McElwee said he will share regardless of whether it validates his opinion of Biden, could provide some direction for the progressive groups eager to prevent him from winning the party’s nomination.

Officials at Justice Democrats, a progressive group that played a significant role in 2018’s elections and is closely tied to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are contemplating 2020 messaging that would shame Democrats seen as too cozy with big business — Biden’s support for and from the financial industry is a likely topic for scrutiny — and with Republicans.

“We’re also going to name the people that are responsible for the mess that we’re in,” said Alexandra Rojas, the group’s executive director. “We definitely want to spread the message that [Biden] represents the centrist wing of the Democratic Party that is radically out of touch.”

Mitchell, whose Working Families Party endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries, said WFP will evaluate all candidates and their records before backing anyone for 2020. He listed several issues he sees as working against Biden, from his opposition to busing as a means of integrating schools in the 1970s to the crime bill and Anita Hill.

“During one of these primary debates, he will be the only candidate who was on the wrong side of school segregation,” Mitchell said. “When he could have intervened for working people, when he could have intervened for women, for people of color, in these cases he chose not to.”

Asked how the WFP would raise these concerns — Paid advertising? Social media? Pushing for coverage from news outlets? In private with the candidates and their staff? — Mitchell replied: “All of the above. We’re going to engage on the staff levels with the candidates, in person, and in public. We believe these issues and this debate needs to be aired publicly.”

Democracy for America’s Chamberlain is similarly harsh on Biden but also suggested that DFA’s messaging would not be explicitly hostile. “I don’t think we’re going to need to do it quite like that,” he said. “We’re going to be running a positive campaign, but one that includes tough questions.”

Chamberlain believes Biden would do well to follow the lead of Sen. Sherrod Brown, who this month decided against a presidential run after visiting the first four caucus and primary states. Brown, otherwise a well-established liberal from Ohio, declined to embrace new left causes like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal — positions that sometimes disappointed the early-state activists he met.

“Sherrod Brown is a very smart, talented person,” Chamberlain said. “He gets it. When he heard a pin drop when he said something like that, he said, ‘This isn’t the year for me.’”

That’s not exactly how Brown framed his decision not to run; he said he’d find more joy fighting for his causes in the Senate. (A popular theory is that Biden scared off Brown by informing him of his imminent candidacy, but Brown and his allies have denied this.) If anything, Brown’s flirtations with a White House bid foreshadowed a way to compete against Biden while subtly emphasizing his problematic votes.

Brown, in an interview days before passing on the 2020 race, reminded BuzzFeed News how he voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, against DOMA, and against the Iraq War. Biden voted for all three, though Brown said he had no plans to draw such contrasts directly.

“I don’t need to make them,” he said. “I think people will see a long-term progressive commitment from me.”",The New Left Wants To Stop Joe Biden. There Just Isn't A Clear Plan To Do It.,buzzfeednews.com,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/joe-biden-progressives-2020-election-primary

Kirsten Gillibrand is less popular than most of her top competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new poll.

The Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday found that Democratic voters in New York have a more favorable view of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former-Vice President Joe Biden than their junior senator.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is flirting with a presidential bid, is less popular than all of those candidates, with Democrats split on their view of him.

Gillibrand kicked off her presidential campaign in January on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and relaunched her bid this week after failing to gain any national traction in the polls after two months.

Only 29 percent of New Yorkers view Gillibrand favorably, despite receiving about two-thirds of the vote in her November re-election bid. Among Democrats, who control her fate in the state’s primary, 42 percent say they like her, 36 percent feel they don’t know enough about her and 20 percent view her negatively.

Biden, who hasn’t officially jumped into the 2020 campaign, is the most popular among his party’s potential nominees, with 82 percent of Democrats in New York viewing him positively. Sanders is at 69 percent and Booker is at 50 percent.

Warren’s number are comparable to Gillibrand’s standing among New York Democrats, and California Sen. Kamala Harris is in the same popularity ballpark, although she is less well known and has lower unfavorable ratings.

Texas Sen. Beto O’Rourke, who is the most recent addition to the campaign, has a net favorability of 21 percentage points, but more than half of voters don’t have an opinion about him yet.

A number of contenders in the crowded Democratic field running for the White House have spoken out against Netanyahu over the Otzma Yehudit deal, including Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.

On Sunday, the High Court disqualified the party’s top candidate from running for Knesset over his overtly racist views. The party is seen as the ideological successor of late anti-Arab rabbi Meir Kahane and his banned Kach party.

The merger with Otzma Yehudit and Netanyahu’s role in engineering it were widely condemned in Israel and abroad, including by many staunch allies of Israel’s government, such as the America Israel Public Affairs Committee.

O’Rourke’s comments underlined growing openness among Democrats to express unease with the Netanyahu government’s policies. Analysts have pointed to a shift within the party away from its formerly traditional unflinching support of Israel, especially among the party’s more progressive flank, which has grown in stature and size in recent months.

On Wednesday, MoveOn, the progressive advocacy movement, asked Democratic presidential candidates not to attend next week’s AIPAC conference in Washington.

No declared presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at the conference, and AIPAC’s policy is that presidential candidates are invited to speak only in election years. However, candidates have in past years circulated at the conference and have held private parlors to meet with activists.

On Monday, candidate Bernie Sanders posted a campaign video showing a supporter praising him for condemning “apartheid-like” conditions among Palestinians.

In 2014, O’Rourke drew fire from pro-Israel groups and others when he was one of eight House members to vote against funding for Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system. He later said he opposed the fact that there was no debate over the aid, and took a J Street-sponsored trip to Israel a year later as he sought to re-burnish his pro-Israel bona fides.

His campaign literature touted him as pro-Israel during a failed bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz in 2018.

As a presidential candidate, O’Rourke has tried to position himself as a consensus-maker, shifting between liberal and moderate positions depending on the topic.

The former congressman had called for impeaching US President Donald Trump but has since backtracked. He also once endorsed Sanders’ “Medicare for All,” but now backs a more moderate House plan known as “Medicare for America.”

“If there’s an issue he might be more centrist on, he’s honest about that,” said New York Rep. Kathleen Rice. “He doesn’t try to pander to a certain base.”

However, Democrats have since entered the race, making the 2020 Presidential Election seem closer than ever. Sixteen significant Democrats are now vying for the opportunity to challenge Trump for the presidency come Tuesday, November 3 next year.

It may seem frivolous to begin analyzing candidates now with Election Day a year and a half away, but now is the most important time for prospective voters to look into candidates and make independent decisions about who could be president.

Candidates need early support in the election cycle to propel them into the Iowa caucus on February 3, 2020. Otherwise, elite Democrats will determine who is even considered for the nomination, as opposed to the people. With that in mind, the public’s knowledge of early candidates is as important as it is in the weeks leading up to Election Day.

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren to former Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke, there are now 15 Democrats and one Independent seeking the Democratic nomination. Despite the pool numbers being so high, only six candidates appear to stand a fighting chance.

Sitting senators Warren (D – MA), Cory Booker (D – NJ), Bernie Sanders (I – VT), Kamala Harris (D – CA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D – NY) are among the top five candidates, but O’Rourke’s success in his 2018 senatorial run makes him popular among young voters. Additionally, other top democrats are hoping former Vice President Joe Biden announces his candidacy in the coming months.

When looking closer into the top six, and potentially seven, early candidates, it is key to examine not only their running platform, but also their likeliness of being an overall good candidate for the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

President Trump ran an unprecedented campaign in 2016, and will almost certainly lean into the same tactics come 2020. That means it’s in the DNC’s best interest to nominate a candidate who can successfully run against Trump by debating eloquently and regaining the support of America’s middle class.

Former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton seemed to be the perfect candidate for the DNC, as she is easily one of the most qualified Democrats of the century and a respected leader internationally. Fault lied, though, in her electability. Consequently, moderate Republicans and Democrats alike were left with a “lesser of two evils” complex. For the Democratic party to see any success in 2020, a nominee without this complex is essential.

Therefore, candidates such as Warren and Sanders can objectively be removed from contention solely on the grounds of electability. Though both top progressives with strong anti-Trump platforms that would appease far-left-leaning Democrats, they leave the larger portion of the party isolated. Both candidates have made numerous enemies in the party during the Trump administration, forcing them into the “lesser of two evils” role that Clinton occupied in 2016. That won’t breed Democratic success.

In terms of electability, O’Rourke and Booker seem to be at an advantage. O’Rourke, a young politician who served in the U.S. House for six years, may not be as experienced as other top Democratic candidates, but his more moderate platform makes him more desirable to both moderate Republicans and Democrats who were unable to vote for Clinton.

On the other hand, Booker’s Senate career and more left-leaning platform make him an ideal Democratic candidate, especially because he lacks major enemies in either party.

Looking ahead a year and a half ahead to the 2020 Presidential Election is no simple task. Politics evolve faster than voters can keep up. With the help of the media, candidates’ platforms change and past scandals can reemerge with a vengeance.

For better or worse, the only feasible way the Democratic party will succeed in 2020 is through the nomination of an electable candidate.",Spurlock: An early analysis of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls,The Sunflower,https://thesunflower.com/38580/opinion/spurlock-an-early-analysis-of-2020-democratic-presidential-hopefuls/

March 21, 2019, 8:30 AM GMT By Alex Seitz-Wald

WASHINGTON — One of the largest Democratic super PACs, American Bridge, is embarking on a $50 million effort designed to soften President Donald Trump's support among the group that cost Democrats the White House in 2016 — white working-class voters in the Upper Midwest.

""We understand that we may not win these voters back entirely, but if we don't make inroads into these areas, we will win the popular vote, lose the Electoral College, and the Senate could be lost for a decade,"" the group wrote in a memo to prospective donors obtained by NBC News.

Officials with the super PAC and its affiliated non-profit, founded by longtime operative David Brock, are on a nationwide fundraising tour to expand the group's budget nearly three-fold, from less than $30 million per two-year election cycle to $80 million for the 2020 campaign.

That $50 million expansion will go toward a massive paid advertising campaign on TV, digital, and radio, officials said, as well as other efforts to persuade rural and exurban voters in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — with the possible addition of Florida — that Trump has been harmful for their economic interests.

""We're going to focus on real-life testimonials and putting them in front of voters,"" Brock said.

Trump has already spent tens of millions of dollars on his reelection campaign and held dozens of rallies while Democrats are just beginning the year-and-half-long process of selecting their nominee.

""While the strongest Democratic field in history brings their messages to primary voters and the American people, we are going to take the fight to Donald Trump, who has sold out hard-working Americans,"" said Andrew Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor who ran for Florida governor last year.

Gillum is joining the board of American Bridge’s 501(c)4 non-profit arm, which is chaired by former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm. New additions also include former DNC Chair Ed Rendell and operative Jessica Mackler, who ran the independent expenditure arm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in last year's midterm elections.

Since Hillary Clinton lost the formerly solidly blue Midwest states, Democrats have debated whether to focus on winning back those voters or doubling down on their more diverse base.

James Carville, the veteran Democratic strategist who works with American Bridge, said most in the party agree the answer has to be some combination of both strategies, but that too few resources have been invested in the Midwest.

""If you want to win the election, you cannot afford to get beat 85-15 in northern Wisconsin, in western Pennsylvania, in north Florida,"" he said. ""I don't dislike rural whites, I'm one, too. Why are we writing them off? That's not only politically stupid, I also think it's immoral.""

American Bridge has been a key player in Senate, House and gubernatorial races, digging up dirt on Republican opponents and deploying ""trackers"" to film GOP candidates' public appearances — some 11,000 events over the past two years. It backed Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary, but is staying neutral in the party's 2020 primary contest.

But playing in presidential politics at scale and running ads is new for the group. After the last election, it looked for ways it could add value to Democratic efforts in the next one and decided on this plan to try soften up Trump's support by leveraging its research prowess.

The group has an existing 75-person operation focused on researching the Trump administration's policies and players, and it has amassed 176 gigabytes of data and more than 24,000 videos and audio clips.

American Bridge regularly shares what it finds with other independent Democratic groups and, in the past, has let others take the lead on running ads. For instance, Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, this week launched the first in what it says will be $100 million worth of ads targeting Trump in a similar set of states.

Less spoken, it also means offering a different message than what national Democrats are talking about — especially in the heat of a primary campaign that will focus largely on what is happening in the most progressive wing of the party.

""We intend to rely on local voices to serve as our messengers in many of these key counties,"" the donor memo reads. ""We know that national voices are not always the most effective with the set of voters we intend to target and persuade, and we will operate accordingly.""",Democratic super PAC launches $50 million effort to weaken Trump with core supporters,NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-super-pac-launches-50-million-effort-weaken-trump-core-n985571

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang Within a ...","Seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be doing regularly inside caucus.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Fantastic turnout at our #ScarbTO North Federal Liberal AGM – looking forward to working closely with the newly elected executive, enthusiastic team of dedicated @liberal_party members, supporters & volunteers as we seek re-election in 2019! #TeamTrudeau pic.twitter.com/bZ1Mj82zI9 — Shaun Chen (@Shaun_Chen) March 17, 2019

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur running for the party’s presidential nomination, tweeted: “The problem with deciding ...","The Green New Deal and “Medicare for All” are old news. The hottest position in the Democratic presidential field this week is abolishing the Electoral College.

Elizabeth Warren kicked things off at a CNN town hall Monday night when the Massachusetts senator drew enthusiastic applause by saying: “Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.”

The next day, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said there was “a lot of wisdom” in abolishing the Electoral College. California Sen. Kamala Harris told late night host Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night that she’s “open to the discussion.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, tweeted a clip of him saying the Electoral College “has got to go.”

It’s the latest push by White House hopefuls to embrace a procedural tactic to rally the Democratic base, following similar calls to scrap the filibuster and increase the size of the Supreme Court. The 2020 candidates are tapping into Democratic anger after Donald Trump became the second Republican in five presidential elections to win the presidency through the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.

The Electoral College, a group that comes together every four years to technically elect the president, is enshrined in the Constitution and won’t be easy to eliminate. O’Rourke suggested a constitutional amendment to award the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.

Several Democratic-controlled states are pushing for a national popular vote. But rather than pass a constitutional amendment, these legislatures are joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a group of states that pledge to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote.

The compact only goes into effect when it includes states representing 270 electoral votes, the majority needed to win the White House. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis brought the current total to 181 when he signed a bill last week to join the compact, and the Democratic governors of Delaware and New Mexico also have bills on their desk.

Still, with legislative sessions winding down, there are no other states expected to join this year.

Warren endorsed the compact after her town hall. Patrick Rosentiel of the group pushing the idea said in an interview that converting to a national popular vote is not a partisan issue.

“The way to do it is through state action and we would welcome Sen. Warren, President Trump, anyone who believes” in the popular vote, said Rosentiel, a self-described “lifelong conservative Republican” who grew tired of his vote not factoring into presidential elections in reliably Democratic Minnesota.

Though the Electoral College favoured Trump in 2016, and some analysts predict it could give him an edge in 2020, it is not necessarily a pro-GOP institution. During Barack Obama’s presidency, many predicted he may benefit from an Electoral College advantage.

That led to criticism of the institution at the time from some Republicans, notably, Trump himself. “The electoral college is a disaster for democracy,” Trump tweeted on the evening of the 2012 election, before it was apparent Obama had also won the national popular vote.

Now that the institution made him president, Trump takes a warmer view. “The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play,” he tweeted Tuesday.

Critics say the Electoral College focuses attention on a handful of swing states at the expense of candidates campaigning throughout the country.

But defenders say the current system almost always lines up with the popular vote and is part of the way the country’s founders wanted to check popular passions and encourages attention to small states that may otherwise get passed over.

Some Democrats agree.

Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur running for the party’s presidential nomination, tweeted: “The problem with deciding Presidential elections via popular vote is that candidates would naturally campaign in urban areas with big media markets and their policies would follow suit. Better to have proportional electoral college votes in each state so you campaign everywhere.”

Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, another longshot Democratic candidate, dismissed the idea as a waste of time.

“It requires a constitutional amendment,” Delaney told CNN Wednesday. “I’d much rather focus on things that can get done.”

Also on Wednesday, the Florida Democratic Party announced its ...","Andrew Gillum, the Democrat who narrowly lost his bid for Florida governor last year, said Wednesday he’s getting back in the political arena for 2020.

His mission: Lead an effort to register and engage 1 million new Florida voters. His objective: Help the eventual Democratic nominee evict President Donald Trump from the White House.

“It is so consequential that we get this thing right,” Gillum said at a kickoff rally for the effort at Florida Memorial University in Miami Gardens. “It is consequential not only for the state of Florida, but for the United States of America that Florida deliver like we never have delivered before.”

Gillum acknowledged that the effort might not be as fun as running for president — which he isn’t doing — or getting involved as a campaign volunteer. He sought to motivate interest in the effort by repeatedly invoking Trump.

“What is happening in Washington, D.C., is not normal. There is nothing normal about what we see happening in the White House. He ain’t normal. There’s a lot about him that ain’t normal,” he said.

If Democrats can complete their mission, Gillum said “we can deny Donald Trump a second term right here in the state of Florida.” Florida awards 29 electoral votes, more than 10 percent of the total needed to win the presidency. The message Gillum wants Florida to send is, “Sir, your eviction notice is served and you are out of the White House.”

Gillum’s effort involves a new organization, Bring It Forward, which was his 2018 slogan. It will also involve Gillum’s political committee, Forward Florida, which has about $3.9 million.

Also on Wednesday, the Florida Democratic Party announced its own $2 million effort to register 200,000 voters before the 2020 presidential. There is some overlap between the two efforts, said Terrie Rizzo, chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party.

“This investment is monumental for the party and is about creating the electorate we want, not the one we have been told we have,” Rizzo said in a written statement. “The Florida Democratic Party has not dedicated enough resources to voter registration in recent years, and we are making it a top priority ahead of 2020.”

The party said the effort would involve technology and data, hiring “dozens” of full-time field organizers across the state, and investing in county Democratic Party organizations.

Gillum said some of the new registrations would come from felons who have finished serving their sentences, who now can register to vote because of an amendment voters added to the state Constitution last year.

He criticized Republican efforts to scale back the impact of the amendment. “I want us to be able to send an unapologetic message to the Legislature to get their hands off Amendment 4,” he said. “It is the law of the land. It is enshrined in the Florida Constitution.”

Gillum

The kickoff for Gillum’s event, heavily promoted by his 2018 campaign team, attracted a few hundred people to Florida Memorial University. Many came to see Gillum.

He said the 2018 loss was painful. “I gotta be honest. It hurt,” he said.

To many Democrats, Gillum, 39, emerged from the 2018 loss as a superstar. He’s no longer mayor of Tallahassee, but has a gig as a CNN political analyst, helping him stay in the public eye.

His advance publicity on social media for Wednesday’s event ignited a flurry of hope among fans — and scorn among some critics — that the former Tallahassee mayor might announce his own presidential candidacy, something that didn’t happen.

Several Broward activists who attended the event said they’d like to see Gillum run for president — someday.

“He’ll make it one day,” said Myrna Nemzoff of Tamarac. “He’s the greatest.”

Gloria Pierce of Pembroke Pines is a big fan. “I love — love — Andrew Gillum,” she said, adding she’s glad he’s waiting because she doesn’t think the time is right in 2020.

And Mitchell Stollberg of Margate, who leads the Broward chapter of Progressive Democrats of America and is legislative chairman of the state Democratic Party’s Progressive Caucus, said he’d like to see Gillum run for governor in 2022, win that job, “then he can run for president.”

Losing a high-profile election isn’t necessarily career ending. Beto O’Rourke, who lost the U.S. Senate race in Texas last year, is running and Stacey Abrams, who lost a race for governor of Georgia, is contemplating a candidacy.

Appearing Friday on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher,” Gillum noted a precedent set by the nation’s 16th president. Abraham Lincoln “lost, went on to become president.”

To understand Beto O’Rourke as a candidate, it’s vital to go beneath the surface of his political backstory. News watchers are already well aware of the former Texas congressman’s good looks, charisma, youthful energy and fundraising prowess. But most remain unaware of an inconvenient truth that could undermine the O’Rourke campaign among the people who matter most — the ones who’ll be voting to choose the Democratic presidential nominee next year.

O’Rourke is hardly eager for those upcoming voters to realize that the growth of his political career is rooted in an alliance with powerful Republicans that began 15 years ago. Or that he supported raising the minimum age for Social Security in 2012. Or that — during six years in Congress, through the end of 2018 — he often aligned himself with Republican positions.

If facts matter, such weighty facts could sink the “Beto for America” presidential campaign. Since his announcement, information gaining traction nationwide runs directly counter to the Beto brand.

“Before becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party,” the Wall Street Journal reported a week ago, “Beto O’Rourke relied on a core group of business-minded Republicans in his Texas hometown to launch and sustain his political career. To win their backing, Mr. O’Rourke opposed Obamacare, voted against Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the Social Security eligibility age.”

Meanwhile, a Washington Post news article — under the headline “Beto O’Rourke’s Political Career Drew on Donations From the Pro-Republican Business Establishment” — also foreshadowed a bumpy ride on the campaign trail. In the eyes of most people who don’t like the GOP, key points in the Post’s reporting are apt to be concerning. For instance:

** “Several of El Paso’s richest business moguls donated to and raised money for O’Rourke’s city council campaigns, drawn to his support for a plan to redevelop El Paso’s poorer neighborhoods. Some later backed a super PAC that would play a key role in helping him defeat an incumbent Democratic congressman.”

** “O’Rourke worked on issues that had the potential to make money for some of his benefactors. His support as a council member for the redevelopment plan, which sparked controversy at the time because it involved relocating low-income residents, many of them Hispanic, coincided with property investments by some of his benefactors.”

** “As a congressman, he supported a $2 billion military funding increase that benefited a company controlled by another major donor. That donor, real estate developer Woody Hunt, was friends with O’Rourke’s late father. Hunt also co-founded and funds an El Paso nonprofit organization that has employed O’Rourke’s wife since 2016.”

Central features of Trumpism are budgets that add billions to already-bloated Pentagon spending while cutting essential programs. In Beto’s last year in Congress, when nearly one-third of House Democrats opposed the record-breaking 2019 National Defense Authorization Act of $717 billion, Beto voted with Trump. (Four senators who are running against O’Rourke voted no: Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.)

Overall, the Post reports, “in contrast to the aspirational image he has fostered in recent years,” O’Rourke’s political career has gone along a path of “winning support from a typically pro-GOP business establishment interested in swaying public policy. Born into one politically potent family and married into another, he benefited repeatedly from his relationships with El Paso’s most powerful residents, including several nationally known Republican moneymen.”

To put his more conservative actions in context, O’Rourke cannot plausibly claim that he was striving to be in sync with the voters who elected him. El Paso and the House district that O’Rourke represented are heavily Democratic. The Wall Street Journal summed up this way: “In a one-party town — the Democrats have held El Paso’s congressional seat for all but one term since 1902 — local Republicans viewed Mr. O’Rourke as one of their own.”

Naturally, O’Rourke would much rather talk in upbeat generalities than answer pointed questions about why anti-Republican voters should cast ballots for him — when he has a long record of going along with many GOP positions they find abhorrent. It may be better for him if unflattering coverage fixates instead on matters like youthful stints as a punk rocker and early computer hacker.

It was just seven years ago when — during his first run for Congress — O’Rourke did a campaign video to tell people in the blue West Texas district that “we’ll have to look at future generations . . . retiring at a later age, paying a greater percentage of their income into Social Security and making other necessary adjustments.” And, the Wall Street Journal reports, “in a candidate questionnaire published two days before the May 2012 primary, Mr. O’Rourke called for raising the Social Security eligibility age and means-testing federal entitlements.” According to exit polling, O’Rourke won that election with major help from Republicans who opted to vote in the Democratic primary and cast their ballots for him by a ratio of more than 7 to 1.

After becoming a congressman, O’Rourke backtracked and, as Politico reports, “co-sponsored legislation that would increase Social Security benefits — without raising the retirement age.” Yet his wobbly stance on Social Security in this decade is a warning flag.

O’Rourke affinity with Republican sensibilities related to corporate power has continued. So has largesse from interests that are the antithesis of progressive values. Notably, for his final term, Beto retired from the House as the member of Congress who was the second-highest recipient of campaign cash from the oil and gas industry.

In June 2015, O’Rourke was one of only 28 Democrats — out of 188 members of the party in the House — who voted to give President Obama the power to negotiate the corporate-oriented Trans-Pacific Partnership. The measure squeaked through the House, propelled by support from 190 Republicans.

A year later, the TPP was a highly visible and contentious issue at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates held anti-TPP signs. (I was one of those delegates and still support Sanders.) These days, O’Rourke is typically aiming to have it both ways, as Vanity Fair reported in a campaign kickoff cover story last week: “O’Rourke now says he would have voted ‘no’ on the ultimate agreement. But in 2015, he traveled with Obama on a trip to Asia to help build support for the deal.”

At the end of last year, the Guardian published an exhaustively researched article under the headline “Beto O’Rourke Frequently Voted for Republican Legislation, Analysis Reveals.” The piece reported that “even as O’Rourke represented one of the most solidly Democratic congressional districts in the United States, he has frequently voted against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills and Trump administration priorities.”

Written by investigative journalist David Sirota (who days ago joined the Sanders presidential campaign as a speechwriter), the Dec. 20 article reviewed “the 167 votes O’Rourke has cast in the House in opposition to the majority of his own party during his six-year tenure in Congress. Many of those votes were not progressive dissents alongside other left-leaning lawmakers, but instead votes to help pass Republican-sponsored legislation.”

A cautionary tale comes from David Romo, an activist and historian in El Paso who describes Beto O’Rourke as a “masterful politician. . . It’s all fluff, it’s all style, it’s all looks.” Romo clashed with City Councilman O’Rourke when he went all-out for redevelopment that would enrich some of his wealthy backers. Romo said recently: “O’Rourke, because of his charisma, can kind of pull off some of this behind-the-scenes power peddling. He was the pretty face in the really ugly gentrification plan that negatively affected the most vulnerable people in El Paso.”

To the casual listener, however, O’Rourke might sound lovely. Consider this verbiage from the presidential campaign trail: “We want to be for everybody, work with everybody. Could care less about your party affiliation or any other difference that might otherwise divide us at this moment of truth, where I really feel we will either make or break this great country and our democracy.”

From O’Rourke, that kind of talk has sometimes overlapped with disinterest in defeating Republicans. Last year, while running for the Senate, O’Rourke helped a friend in need — Texas GOP Congressman Will Hurd — by notably refusing to endorse his Democratic opponent. Gina Ortiz Jones, a gay Filipina-American, had momentum in a district with a majority of Hispanics. But O’Rourke’s solidarity with his Republican colleague may well have saved Hurd’s seat.

Hurd won re-election by under one-half of a percentage point, while O’Rourke won in the district by a five-point margin. As the New York Times reported, O’Rourke “had elevated” his Republican colleague Hurd “with frequent praise and, most memorably, a live-streamed bipartisan road trip that helped jump-start their midterm campaigns.” During the campaign, O’Rourke tried to justify his refusal to endorse Hurd’s Democratic opponent by declaring: “This is a place where my politics and my job and my commitment to this country come into conflict. I’m going to put country over party.”

When Politico asked O’Rourke late last year whether he considered himself to be a progressive Democrat, O’Rourke replied: “I don’t know. I’m just, as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign, I’m not big on labels. I don’t get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. I’m for everyone.”

Everyone?

After O’Rourke campaigned in the Detroit area a few days ago, the Detroit Metro Times published information that would concern anyone with minimally progressive leanings: “He supported Republican efforts to limit the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established by Obama and Democrats to protect Americans from Wall Street following the recession. O’Rourke also broke with the party to support Trump and GOP attempts to loosen requirements in hiring border patrol agents; chip away at the Affordable Care Act; kill a ban on oil drilling in parts of the Gulf of Mexico; and lift the 40-year-old oil export ban. He also supported Republican legislation that protected utility companies that start wildfires.”

It’s understandable that many progressives came out of 2018 with a favorable view of O’Rourke. He ran a strong campaign that got remarkably close to unseating the odious Sen. Ted Cruz. Along the way, O’Rourke showed himself to be eloquent and tireless. Some of his stances are both enlightened and longstanding, as with his advocacy for legalizing marijuana. And O’Rourke provided some stunning moments of oratory, as in a viral video that showed his response to a question about NFL players kneeling in protest during the national anthem; his support for dissent in the context of civil rights history was exemplary.

Yet, overall, there’s a good reason why O’Rourke declines to call himself “progressive.” He isn’t. His alliances and sensibilities, when you strip away some cultural affinities and limited social-justice positions, are bedrock corporate.

In his quest for a Democratic nomination that will require support from a primary electorate that leans progressive, Beto O’Rourke will be running to elude his actual record. If it catches up with him, he’s going to lose.

Progressive pundits think he’s unwoke; primary voters might not care

Believe it or not, there are still a few Democrats left in the United States Senate who are not running for president. And among those sitting on the sidelines, they see a lot to like in a politician who hasn’t joined the field: Joe Biden.

“If he were in the race, he would I think have a lot of support, and he’s someone I’d think very seriously about supporting,” Pennsylvania Democratic senator Bob Casey tells National Review. “I don’t know a vice president who was more effective, who had greater responsibility.”

Wisconsin Democratic senator Tammy Baldwin, who won reelection by eleven points in her crucial swing state last November, also has praise for him: “The last few times [Biden has] been in Wisconsin, just focusing on respecting the dignity of hard work and economic opportunity, he’s really knocked it out of the park.”

“As have many other Democratic candidates,” she quickly adds.

“Joe Biden’s been a wonderful public servant,” says Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was Hillary Clinton’s 2016 running mate.

But for every elected Democratic official who likes Biden, you can find scores of pundits who will tell you that he is overrated as a potential primary candidate. “If he declares for the presidency, Biden will face a Democratic electorate that has moved on from his brand of politics,” according to one Huffington Post writer.

Is Biden too old, too corporatist, too conservative for today’s Democratic party? Trying predict the future is a fool’s errand, but it’s safe to say that he has had a very good 2019 so far, and that his path to the nomination remains very realistic.

During the first week of March, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg announced he wouldn’t seek the Democratic nomination. His absence would help Biden consolidate self-described moderate Democrats. Around the same time, Ohio senator Sherrod Brown announced he wouldn’t run, and that could help Biden add more union members to his coalition. Brown’s absence would also bolster the claim that Biden has the best shot of winning back Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, the three Rust Belt states that narrowly decided the 2016 election. Brown publicly warned MSNBC viewers during a March 13 appearance that 2020 hopefuls who are lurching leftward aren’t thinking about the general election.

The candidate Biden would be running against in the “moderate” lane is Amy Klobuchar, who launched her campaign on February 10. The Minnesota senator is thought by some to have underappreciated strength in the neighboring state of Iowa, but she was sitting at 3 percent in an Iowa poll conducted March 3–6 for the Des Moines Register and CNN. The good news for Klobuchar is that people are still talking about her: She was the subject of the best article published so far about the 2020 Democratic primary. The bad news? That article, by Caitlin Flanagan in The Atlantic, was a devastating piece on the senator’s alleged abusive behavior toward her staff, which ranged from berating her employees to throwing objects at them.

And what about the crowded “progressive” lane? All of those candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, but they have fought over whether private health insurance should be abolished and whether existing border fencing should be torn down. Kamala Harris, who could be the most formidable opponent in a head-to-head race against Biden, had a particularly bad stumble on “Medicare for all.” Elizabeth Warren is still trying to recover from her DNA test. The leading candidate in this group is socialist Bernie Sanders, who has drawn impressive crowds and put up impressive fundraising numbers — and would be Biden’s ideal foil in 2020.

The Des Moines Register poll mentioned above found Biden leading Sanders 27 percent to 25 percent in Iowa, with all other candidates in the single digits. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight observes that the Iowa poll, when adjusted for name recognition, “doesn’t really change much at all.” It’s early, but CNN’s Harry Enten points out that the “leader in the Iowa caucuses polls at this point have won the nomination 7 of 14 times.”

Perhaps the best sign for Biden’s prospects could be seen in a March 15 article by Politico’s Gabby Orr, who reported that “behind closed doors, [President Trump] has fixated on Biden, while top aides have tried to assure their boss that the former vice president is doomed” in an increasingly left-wing party. As he proved in 2016, Trump has a better intuitive grasp of electoral politics than most political aides and pundits.

Talk of Biden’s being out of step with today’s Democratic party on this or that issue ignores what Democratic voters are actually saying. The Iowa poll found that 70 percent of likely caucus-goers say Joe Biden’s political views are “about right,” while 14 percent say Biden is “too conservative.” Only 48 percent say Bernie Sanders’s views are “about right,” while 44 percent say Sanders is “too liberal.” The same poll found that 49 percent of voters fully back “Medicare for all,” while 35 percent only support taking steps toward it — the kind of half measure Biden will likely favor — and 11 percent oppose it outright.

Advertisement

There are a lot of Democratic voters who don’t see some impassable divide between Biden and Sanders. “The Joe Biden–Bernie Sanders duopoly was interesting to me in that their supporters’ second choice was each other, primarily,” J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who conducted the Iowa survey, tells National Review. Biden’s campaign to move America’s health-care system to the left of Obamacare and more than double the federal minimum wage — from $7.25 to $15 — would have been seen as quite liberal the day before yesterday.

Advertisement

Those who argue that Biden is too out of touch with today’s Democratic party also fail to take into account that the Democratic nominee doesn’t really need a majority of the party to win the nomination — not at the beginning, at least. He or she likely needs to win two out of the first three marquee contests — Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. In a large field, winning those early states might require only one-third of the electorate, as Trump proved in 2016. With two early wins, voters would very likely fall in line, just as they did for Trump and Clinton in 2016, Obama and McCain in 2008, Kerry in 2004, Bush in 2000, and Dole in 1996.

Mitt Romney is the only candidate in nearly three decades who (kind of) broke this rule: He was declared the winner of Iowa on Caucus Night (and the headlines are what counts when it comes to building momentum) but later fell behind Santorum by 34 votes in the final tally; several precincts were never counted. The last major-party nominee who didn’t win either Iowa or New Hampshire was Bill Clinton in 1992, when Iowa senator Tom Harkin took his home state off the map and Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won New Hampshire.

Can Biden win two of the three early states? He’s a couple of points ahead of Sanders in early Iowa polling and a few points behind Sanders in New Hampshire polling. In South Carolina, Biden led Sanders by 16 points in a recent Emerson poll — 37 percent to 21 percent — with all other candidates in single digits. In 2016, shortly after Sanders scored a 22-point win over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, the Vermont socialist was crushed by Clinton in South Carolina by 47 points. The 77-year-old Sanders takes the age issue off the table for 76-year-old Biden, but Sanders’s weakness among African-American voters is the real reason he would be Biden’s ideal foil.

Some have suggested that Biden’s record on busing in the 1970s would badly damage him among African-American voters. But there is perhaps no better example of the disconnect between some progressive pundits and actual Democratic voters than the discussion of this issue.

New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote in a March column that Biden’s rhetoric in the 1970s about busing “was on the same wavelength” as the vicious segregationist George Wallace’s had been. “The real problem with busing,” Biden said at the time, was that “you take people who aren’t racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children’s intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school . . . and you’re going to fill them with hatred.”

The same day as that column appeared, McClatchy reporter Katie Glueck published an article titled: “In a shifting party, Biden maintains strength with SC’s black Democrats.” The piece was filled with comments from African-American voters optimistic about a Biden candidacy, along with pastors and politicians testifying to his strength as a candidate. “If Biden gets in the race, everybody else would be running for second place,” South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, told Jonathan Martin and Astead Herndon of the New York Times in January.

Can any candidate attack Biden’s position on busing in the 1970s without taking the position today that some children currently attending safe and successful suburban schools should be bused to dangerous and failing urban schools? It’s hard to believe that any Democratic candidate who could win the presidency in 2020 will run on that platform. It would be good, of course, if Democratic candidates supported policies to allow children attending dangerous and failing schools to attend safe and successful schools. But then those candidates would be conservative Republicans who back school-choice programs, not liberal Democrats beholden to teachers’ unions.

Is it easy to see a different Democratic candidate, such as Kamala Harris, carrying Iowa and South Carolina and capturing the nomination? Of course. Bernie Sanders is an equally serious candidate, and no one should count out the rest of the field, either.

Navigating an energized progressive base will be no simple task for Biden. For example, Biden is a longtime supporter of the Hyde amendment, a ban on federal funding of elective abortions, unlike recent Democratic presidential nominees. Tim Kaine was tripped up in 2016 trying to reconcile his support for the ban with Hillary Clinton’s opposition, but today he says: “I don’t think it’s a litmus [test]. I think it’s a very important issue to people of all different stripes. . . . That one is going to be hashed out, along with so many others, during the primary process and then during the general.”

Will Biden flip-flop on the issue? Or will he continue to oppose the progressive Democratic base? Both options, on this matter and others, carry political risks. Biden will face plenty of obstacles once he enters the race, but none appear so large right now that he could not make it to the general election.

Local leaders fear funding for a new college campus and dialysis in High Prairie could be in jeopardy in the upcoming provincial election.



Town of High Prairie Mayor Brian Panasiuk is concerned that funding could be lost for a new Northern Lakes College campus and renal dialysis at High Prairie Health Complex.



“Given these projects are not started I am concerned that the election could put these projects at risk,” Panasiuk says.



“Those two projects represent an investment of around $26 million in our community.”



An election must be held before June.



Premier Rachel Notley is expected to call the election after the throne speech March 18.



Ground was broken Sept. 24, 2018 for the new consolidated campus scheduled to open in fall 2020.



Funding of $21.6 million was announced March 27, 2017 by the New Democratic Party government.



Construction is set to start in the spring.



Funding of $5.2 million for a new dialysis clinic in the hospital was announced Feb. 6 and scheduled to open in 2020.



Another important issue for Panasiuk is to secure provincial funding for broadband in the region.



“Without provincial support, getting the town connected will be economically difficult,” Panasiuk says.



“During the election I would like to see us get a commitment to fund those projects from all political parties.”



College board chair Daniel Vandermeulen is more optimistic about the new campus.



“We hope funding won’t be jeopardized and we’d be surprised if it did,” he says.



He says construction is set to start in April and the college has awarded tenders.



Funding for broadband and potable water are the main priorities for Big Lakes County.



“The county would like the government to fund broadband and rural water distribution,” Reeve Richard Simard says.



“The county plans to move forward with broadband and we would like the government to come out with a provincial broadband strategy and subsequent funding for communities.”

Subscribe today to receive it !

On the morning of November 13, 2018, the Twitter account of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-based organization demanding a Green New Deal (GND), posted the following message: BREAKING: we’ve begun a sit in inside @NancyPelosi’s office because @HouseDemocrats have failed our generation time and time again. They offer us a death sentence. We demand a #GreenNewDeal. Joined by the Congresswoman-elect from New York’s 14th District, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the crowd of young activists occupying Pelosi’s office catapulted the idea of a Green New Deal into mainstream discussion. Unfortunately, just before Christmas, Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi brushed aside the proposal for a GND select committee and replaced it with a hollowed-out and toothless substitute. Not to be deterred Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey introduced in February a new resolution outlining more specific principles and goals for a GND. It has already gained seventy-six co-signers in Congress and has spurred another round of international media attention. Once again, the resolution was brushed off by Pelosi as a “green dream or whatever they call it.” As four climate writers in Jacobin argued on the day it was unveiled, the resolution is quite good. While a few business-friendly elements of the plan don’t square with a socialist climate politics, it does commit to confronting the overwhelming challenge of climate change with massive federal programs that tackle head-on the country’s horrific economic and racial injustices in access to clean air, water, housing, transit, and many other basic needs. The confrontational strategy used by both Sunrise and Ocasio-Cortez to promote the GND is a major step forward for climate politics. During the Obama administration, most environmental groups focused on cozying up to the Democratic political establishment, only to watch an ill-conceived “cap and trade” bill go down in flames amidst a lack of popular mobilization. In contrast, the recent GND campaign began in earnest with corporate-free electoral campaigns that challenged neoliberal politicians, and won startling victories. After the election, these forces chose a public showdown with Democratic elites and their fossil fuel industry donors. As the campaign sharply targeted these establishment obstacles to climate action, it popularized the vital demand for a GND across a mass audience. This wave of confrontational activism has now catapulted the GND into mainstream attention. Unfortunately, a policy’s popular support is anything but a guarantee of its passage. Medicare for All, for example, enjoys 70 percent popular approval but elite opposition to it remains formidable. And while confrontations with elected elites are certainly a step in the right direction, they won’t be sufficient to win a GND on the scale — and at the pace — we so desperately need. In the likely case we don’t completely end capitalism in the next decade, we need a plan for effectively dealing with climate change anyway. Winning a transformative GND will require massive leverage over the political and economic system. We need the ability to force these changes over the objection of broad sections of the capitalist class, who are fiercely unwilling to lose their profits. The confrontational tactics and electoral challenges of the growing GND movement are essential parts of the leverage we need, but we think history shows they won’t be enough. We will also need direct leverage against the capitalist class, right in the places where they make their money. Who has that leverage? In short, working people, united and organized. The working class not only has the numbers as the majority of society, but it also stands in direct antagonism to the capitalists causing the climate crisis. Most importantly, the working class has a “lever” at the core of the operation of the capitalist system. If workers stop working, or go on strike, business as usual grinds to a halt. As we’ve seen recently, this ability to shut down the system at its core is the greatest source of power for the working class as a whole. When workers strike, or organize other mass disruptive actions, those in power are forced to pay attention. Why would the working class unite for a GND? For one thing, working people are set up to suffer the worst effects of climate devastation — especially where poverty or oppression make it far harder to survive, move, or adapt. Stopping climate change will take massive amounts of work to transform the economy, and a GND can be a vehicle to build the power, unity, and material conditions of all working people. Working-class people therefore have a common interest to stop climate change through a GND. A strategy of building working-class power and waging class struggle from below is the only thing that can save the planet. The history of the original New Deal shows that major progressive reforms can only be won under capitalism by massive working-class organization and disruption. And the GND proposed by Ocasio-Cortez is far more ambitious even than that. To figure out our strategy, we need to look for guidance from how the New Deal was won.

Winning the Old New Deal To put it briefly, the New Deal was won through mass working-class revolt. The original New Deal was not won because Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Democratic Party leaders were kind. These elites supported labor and welfare reforms only in the face of a mass revolt of the working class; what Mike Davis calls “the highwater mark of the class struggle in modern American history [between 1933–1937].” Strikes shut down auto factories in Toledo and across the Midwest. Longshoremen and teamsters organized a four-day general strike in San Francisco, effectively shutting down the city. After the 1935 Wagner Act protected certain rights to unionize, a 1936–1937 wave of sit-down factory strikes proved labor militancy would not stop with these legal reforms alone. This uprising was not just among the formally employed, industrial working class. As Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward recall, communist-organized “unemployed councils” engaged in “mob looting” and mass demonstrations demanding jobs and relief. It was mass, militant action by rank-and-file workers that pushed the state to raise taxes on the rich, finance unprecedented welfare programs, and increase the legal rights and bargaining power of many laborers. Of course, these reforms were hated by business interests. FDR alienated much of the capitalist class — claiming to “welcome their hatred” in his famous 1936 campaign speech — while counting on what Davis describes as the “powerful electoral bulwark that the surge of four million workers into the CIO during 1935–1937 offered.” Ultimately, the New Deal coalition succeeded by splitting certain sectors of the capitalist class into a temporary surrender. Bosses from labor-intensive sectors, including manufacturing, garment making, and the racialized system of agriculture in the South, were those most bitterly opposed to the New Deal. But facing mass labor actions and social disruptions by the unemployed and working classes as a whole, the capital-intensive factions of the capitalist class decided to turn tail. Their low labor costs overall made them more willing to swallow reforms that increased labor’s bargaining power over critical issues of wages and the conditions of work. Among these capital-intensive interests were the Rockefeller oil trusts, General Electric, and the investment banks. These turncoat capitalists deemed a liberal, technocratic, segregationist New Deal to be a satisfactory price to pay to regain stability in the midst of the depression. Working-class action made them fear not only immediate economic losses, but the mass delegitimation of capitalism and private property. This resigned support from one sector of capital helped FDR pass reforms that were very costly to the more labor-intensive industries, such as garments and the formerly labor-intensive automobile industry. Agriculture and domestic labor were exempted from much of FDR’s labor reforms in order to hold together his coalition with the “Dixiecrat” South whose capitalists (and capitalist Democratic Party) relied on these labor-intensive industries. Since these industries depended heavily on black workers, this enshrined the Democrats’ segregationism in the New Deal. The gains of the New Deal were limited, segregated by gender and race, and largely short-lived. In addition to these failures of policy, there were also strategic failures that undermined and cut short the partial gains of the New Deal. Growing union bureaucracies were emboldened by their new leverage over the national Democratic Party, and traded away independent working-class political organization for partnership with FDR’s still capitalist-dominated and, in the South, segregationist Democrats. By WWII, unions agreed to devastating “no strike” pledges. When workers struck anyway in 1941, FDR turned on the rank and file, sending the army to break a major aviation strike in Inglewood, California — what Davis calls the “Pullman of the New Deal.” Despite the renewal of mass strike activity in 1945–46, the eight prior years of accommodation left the labor movement weak enough to suffer a catastrophic defeat with the passage of the 1947 Taft-Hartley restrictions on union organizing. Still, the concessions that the working class was able to win in this short period are in many ways unprecedented: Social Security, legal protections for unionization and collective bargaining, and vast new public infrastructure, to name a few. One wonders what might have been possible if working people’s high level of organization had been sustained or expanded. In short, the New Deal was won by dividing the capitalist class against itself, not through well-intentioned interest group lobbying and political activism focused only on making demands inside the halls of state power, but rather through leverage from outside those halls, with working-class upheaval from below. Socialists know that we cannot entrust the ruling class with the ambitious working-class transformations we seek. However, as Engels wrote, “we can wring concessions from it [the capitalist-dominated state], but never look to it to carry out our job.”

How to Avoid the New Deal’s Limitations As we learn from the strategy that won the old New Deal, we need to heed its lessons and limits. First, the segregationist nature of the New Deal coalition served to divide the working class. For seventy years since, conservatives and neoliberals have leveraged these divisions in their offensive against taxes, unions, and wealth redistribution. The GND commitment to a job guarantee and economic, gender, and racial justice must ensure the benefits of the program do not accrue disproportionately to certain segments of the working class. The current resolution makes a strong commitment to this inclusive goal, but the work to achieve that pledge lies ahead. Second, the absorption of working-class militancy into elite Democratic Party brokerage politics was fatal. FDR and key segments of the trade union bureaucracy suppressed rank-and-file radicalism with political sabotage, legal persecution, and force. The dangers of being cajoled and absorbed into an even more business-friendly Democratic Party are even greater today. Bernie Sanders is fortunately not the kind of liberal “save capitalism” politician that FDR was. But, as he himself keeps saying, we need not one president, but a persistent mass movement of millions to overcome corporate control of our government. We hope today’s renewed workers’ militancy paves the way for a truly independent, mass working-class party that can secure and advance our gains in the state. We have to make sure militancy keeps building after we win a GND — otherwise we won’t get to keep it. Finally, to that end, we need a GND that will build working-class militancy and power through public ownership and a unionized jobs guarantee. We need a GND free of “public-private partnerships” or subcontracting to private industry, as was central to the New Deal and, especially, the federal World War II mobilization. These massive public investments in private industry only built the power of capitalists to break strikes and divide workers after the war. Instead, we need public or worker ownership of all GND programs, in a way that builds the popular and institutional base for such profit-free, social ownership of all key infrastructure in energy, water, and transit. Unionizing all jobs in socially run GND programs will support workers themselves to direct and contest the very nature of our economy. Beyond the excellent start of the GND resolution, socialists and working people should fight for a unionized job guarantee and public or worker ownership of all GND programs, to keep working-class power growing for good.

Splitting Capital With those lessons in mind, how do we apply the strategy that won the New Deal to winning a GND today? Capitalists keep a firm grip on the state in at least two ways. First, they place their people into state positions, and influence other state officials through social ties, donations, and the lure of lucrative work after leaving office. Second, they threaten and carry out “capital strikes.” Whenever state managers adopt policies that slow or impede the flow of private profit, capitalists threaten to stop investing. When they do stop the flow of capital, the investors’ aim is to “make the economy scream” to tank popular support for progressive governments. The fight for a GND will have to overcome these powers over the state, wielded by some of the most dangerously mighty corporations in history. For a measure of the Goliaths we’re up against, consider that ExxonMobil, the largest fossil fuel company in the US, had $237 billion in revenue in 2017. This wealth means power over our economy, and an enormous influence over our political system. These companies won’t ever give up on selling the vast reserves they’re sitting on — US reserves alone were worth an estimated $28 trillion in 2014 — but many other sectors of capital are not as closely tied to fossil fuels. Though no industry is fully disconnected from oil, gas, and coal, it is easy to imagine how capitalists heavily invested in telecom or pharmaceutical companies might allow a GND far sooner than the board members at Exxon. The cleavage in the old New Deal was between capital- and labor-intensive sectors of capital. The potential cleavage for a GND will likely be between carbon-intensive and low-carbon sectors. Large industries that currently rely heavily on fossil fuels, like logistics, agriculture, or construction would be seriously disrupted by the transition to a clean energy economy. Non-fossil fuel capitalists would also be hurt by a GND: a jobs guarantee would cost them much of their power to manipulate workers with the threat of unemployment, most would pay higher taxes, and all would lose some of their control over the economy. But the transition for these sectors would be made possible by the enormous public investment and innovation unleashed by the GND, and in the medium term they would gain huge savings through publicly provided energy, transit, housing, and more. And in the long term, of course, these firms and their investors would benefit enormously by averting the most catastrophic climate disasters, which will otherwise increasingly threaten massive investments in fixed capital such as logistics infrastructure and real estate. Nevertheless, all firms are oriented to short-term profits, and the climate obstruction of the billionaire-funded Democratic Party leadership proves that all sectors of the corporate class are willing to accept catastrophic climate change if it means protecting their power over the economy. If powerful capitalists will not push the government to adopt the GND, that leaves only one force that has both the interest in a socially just green transformation and the social power to see it through: an organized and militant working-class movement. Without a change of course, the working class will continue to bear the brunt of the twin crises of economic deprivation and increasing climate devastation. However, a new working-class movement has two means — mass economic disruption and independent political organization — that can turn our crisis into an economic and political crisis for the ruling class. Workplace organization and militancy can threaten the profits of major corporations. These firms would then be forced to choose between, on the one hand, the costs of climate inaction — increasing social and climatic disruption and the delegitimization of the capitalist system in general — and the costs of climate action, described above. In other words, the goal of the climate movement should be to raise the costs of inaction so high that political obstruction becomes cost prohibitive. Rising levels of class struggle from below can thus wrest power over the state away from capitalist control. This is what record high levels of worker militancy partly achieved in the 1930s and 1940s, and what the working class will have to accomplish further in the 2020s and 2030s if we are to save the planet from climate apocalypse. In short, it has to become clear to a large section of capitalists that the system as they’ve known it is done, and their least painful choice is to accept the demands of workers for a livable climate and an end to poverty through a GND.",A Real Green New Deal Means Class Struggle,Jacobin,https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/03/green-new-deal-class-struggle-organizing

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban sought to put on a brave face after his party’s suspension from the European People’s Party grouping, arguing that at least EPP remained united ahead of May 23-26 European Parliament elections.

“The EPP made a good decision because it maintained unity,” said Orban, who attended the meeting where the action took place. “We made a good decision, as no roads were closed. After the elections, Fidesz and the EPP can both decide freely about our relationship.” EPP leader Manfred Weber said Fidesz “can no longer propose candidates for posts” in the group and said they cannot vote on issues or join major group meetings as long as the suspension lasts. “The EPP was very clear and united ... that the suspension is needed,” Weber said. “It was a very hard decision.”

Orban said Fidesz had itself proposed the measures approved Wednesday by the EPP and repeated his claim that his party would have abandoned the alliance if it would have made any “disrespectful” decisions about the Hungarian party. “In my right hand during the meeting, I had the letter where it was already stated that we would leave,” Orban said. “So, if we would have not had this compromise proposal, I would have left the EPP today.” An evaluation commission led by former EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy will now follow developments within Hungary, where the Fidesz party controls the government, to see when and if the suspension can be lifted. “We will now campaign for the victory of the EPP,” said Orban, but added that “after the elections, we will have to see how we will position ourselves.” Orban’s authoritarian style and anti-European Union, anti-migration policies have long put him at odds with many members of the alliance, and he made it clear after the meeting that he did was not planning major changes.

“We are committed to a strong European Union ... and we can’t imagine any change in issue of migration,” Orban said. “Neither can we imagine a compromise in the protection of European Christianity, of Christian values and culture.” EPP member parties from 12 countries called for Fidesz’s suspension or ouster, deeming Orban’s views and policies incompatible with Christian Democratic values.

Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said that freezing Fidesz’s membership would be “a feasible route” and it was confirmed by Weber hours later “As long as Fidesz has not fully restored confidence, normal full membership can’t remain in place,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said, according to German news agency dpa. The Fidesz-led Hungarian government last week ended a campaign targeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is also part of the EPP, and Orban sent letters apologizing for describing as “useful idiots” those in the EPP advocating for his party’s expulsion. Orban also showed a greater willingness to compromise on a third condition set by EPP parliamentary leader Manfred Weber for Fidesz to stay in the alliance — letting the Central European University, founded by Hungarian-American financier George Soros, keep all of its activities in Budapest. CEU says it soon will be moving its U.S.-accredited programs to Vienna because the Hungarian government has refused to sign agreements needed for them to stay in the Hungarian capital. The state of Bavaria, home to Weber, has offered to finance two professorships at the CEU via Munich’s Technical University at Weber’s encouragement. After the EPP meeting, CEU reiterated its position that it still needs “legal guarantees” from the Hungarian government about its activities in Budapest. “These developments do not change CEU’s plans in relation to Vienna,” CEU Rector Michael Ignatieff said. “The university will establish a campus in Vienna to begin operations in September 2019.” ___ Gorondi reported from Budapest.

The government panel that was holding negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines-Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (NDFP-CPP-NPA), led by Labor Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III, was dissolved effective March 18.

“The discontinuance of the services of the members of the GRP (Government of the Republic of the Philippines) panel is in line with the termination of peace talks with the NDFP. But we will reconstitute the panel at a national scope in accordance with the whole-of-nation approach we are advocating to achieve inclusive and sustainable peace,” Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito G. Galvez, Jr. said in a statement released late Wednesday.

The former members of the negotiating panel were also directed to “turn over all official documents, papers and properties” in their possession to the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity, according to Presidential Spokesperson Salvador S. Panelo.









Mr. Panelo, at a Palace press briefing, said the new panel will be composed of “sectoral representatives, local government units and military.”

Mr. Galvez said the shift in the peace strategy will pave the way for the creation of a more inclusive group that will supervise localized engagements.

“For 32 years, we didn’t gain anything from the talks, and it is being used by the CPP-NPA as a leverage for them to strengthen their forces and take advantage of the sincerity of the government,” Mr. Galvez said.

Exiled CPP founder Jose Maria C. Sison, on the other hand, said he already expected the cancellation of the appointment of the government peace negotiators after Mr. Duterte cancelled peace talks in late 2017.

Mr. Sison said the President “has completely ignored the consistent NDFP policy of openness to peace negotiations.”

ARRESTS

Meanwhile, joint forces of the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines arrested Renante Gamara, an NDFP consultant and former secretary of the Metro Manila Regional Party Committee of the CPP-NPA, for possession of firearms, explosive and subversive documents.

Also nabbed during the operation in Imus, Cavite was Arturo Jose Balagat, a retired priest and currently the provincial chairperson of the Cooperative Development Council of Cavite and vice chairperson of the Regional Cooperative Development Council of Region 4-A.

Mr. Gamara was first arrested in 2012 in Las Piñas City for charges on kidnapping and the murder of soldier Eriberto Eclavea in Quezon Province.

Police said Mr. Gamara will now face charges on illegal possession of firearms and explosives while Mr. Balagat will remain under the custody of the National Capital Region Police Office for further investigation. — Arjay L.

It’s not clear yet which 2020 Democratic candidates — if any — were planning to attend this year. But in the past three presidential cycles, the eventual nominees for both parties spoke at the conference the year of the election.

Iram Ali, MoveOn’s campaign director, told NBC News that the boycott only applies to this year’s conference. That could leave the door open for candidates to attend next year, when the Democratic presidential primary will be in full swing. But she described alignment with AIPAC as anti-progressive.

“It’s important that the next Democratic nominee has progressive values, not only in their domestic policies, but also in their foreign policies,” Ali said. “You cannot be a progressive and support AIPAC because of the policies that they’ve supported.”

Josh Orton, the policy director for Vermont Inepdendent Sen. Bernie Sanders, told NBC News that “Sen. Sanders has no plans to attend the AIPAC conference. He’s concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution.”

Sanders didn't attend the 2016 conference while he was running in the Democratic primary, but addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at length during a speech around the conference.

Four announced 2020 Democratic candidates have spoken at AIPAC before: Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have all spoken at the policy conference. Former Vice President Joe Biden has also addressed AIPAC before.

While there’s no confirmation that any candidates will attend this year’s conference, Rep. John Delaney’s communication’s director Will McDonald said he plans to attend in the future.

“John is very disappointed that he can't attend this year, he has attended every year since he has been in Congress and he very much looks forward to being back next year,” McDonald said.

No other 2020 Democratic campaigns have committed to attending or avoiding the conference in the future.

Ali said MoveOn won’t use speaking at AIPAC as a litmus test, but that it will be one of several benchmarks used to endorse a 2020 candidate.

“We will be setting various benchmarks over the next year and a half. This is not the only benchmark that we’re measuring candidates against,” Ali said. “We will be looking holistically at candidates going into the primaries.”",No Democratic presidential candidates committed to AIPAC conference as liberal group calls for boycott,NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/card/no-democratic-presidential-candidates-committed-aipac-conference-liberal-group-calls-n985851?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_mtp

Much of the Democratic Party, including almost the entire pack of contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, has embraced the concept of a Green New Deal (GND). This is an ambitious plan for slashing greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time creating good-paying jobs, improving education, and reducing inequality.

At this point, the specific policies entailed by these ambitious goals are largely up for grabs, as is the question of how to pay for this agenda. One way of paying for it, borrowing from the economic doctrine know as Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), is that we don’t have to.

Modern Monetary Theory argues that a government that prints its own currency is not constrained in its spending by its tax revenue. Some on the left have argued that we can just print whatever money we need to finance a GND. This claim does not make sense.

The logic of MMT’s claim is that, since the US government prints its own currency, it is not constrained by revenue from taxes, or what it borrows in credit markets. It can always just print the money it needs to cover its spending.

If the government wants to spend another billion dollars paying workers to build roads or paying contractors for steel, who is going to turn down its money? They will just be happy to get the money, end of story.

The limiting factor is that, at some point, this process can lead to inflation. If an economy has a substantial amount of excess capacity, meaning that there are a large number of unemployed workers and idle factories and other facilities, the additional spending due to printing money will just put some workers and factories to use. There should still be plenty of competitive pressure to limit wage and price increases.

This was quite effectively demonstrated in the recovery from the Great Recession, in which the United States, the eurozone, and Japan have all struggled to increase their rates of inflation. In all three cases, the large-scale printing of money had a modest impact, at best, in raising the rate of inflation. The predictions of runaway inflation made by conservative economists were shown to be completely wrong.

While it’s true that countries could print money to boost their economies to recover from the Great Recession, that doesn’t mean that the United States could now spend a large amount of money on GND projects, without tax increases and/or offsetting spending cuts. The reason is that we have largely recovered from the Great Recession.

The unemployment rate is now under 4.0 percent, lower than it was before the Great Recession started. While there is some evidence of slack in the labor market by various measures, it has tightened to the point that workers are now seeing pay increases that exceed the rate of inflation.

The average hourly wage increased by 3.2 percent over the last year. That compares to a 2.8 percent rate of increase in the prior year, and a 2.4 percent increase from 2016 to 2017. This tightening of the labor market is great news because it means that millions more workers have jobs and that most workers are now sharing in the gains from growth.

However, it means that we are pretty much at the end of the “just print money” option. If we were to spend an additional $200 billion a year (1.0 percent of GDP) on installing solar panels and windmills, retrofitting buildings, and building electric cars and buses, it would further increase demand in the labor market and almost certainly lead to considerably more rapid wage growth.

While slightly faster wage growth would be fine, this sort of boost to demand is likely to quickly push the rate of wage growth to well over 4.0 percent or even 5.0 percent. Higher wages could come partly out of profits (there was an enormous shift from wages to profits in the Great Recession, which could be reversed), but pretty soon, substantially more rapid wage growth would be passed on in prices.

We would then be getting the story that the conservative economists had always warned about, with printing money leading to inflation. How high inflation goes would depend on how far we go down the just print money route.

All of our models show that inflation is a gradual process, with more rapid price increases leading workers to demand higher wages, which are then passed on in another round of price increases.

It’s hard to say with any certainty how fast this inflation would accelerate since we haven’t really had much of a problem with inflation since the 1970s, almost 40 years ago. The world is a very different place today, with the US having a much more open economy and unions being far less powerful.

Still, there is little reason to question that the standard economic logic will still apply. If we have a very tight labor market where employers are competing for workers by bidding up wages, this will lead to upward pressure on prices, which will cause workers to demand higher wages to maintain their standard of living.

MMT does not give us a way around this picture. While it was important to point out that we didn’t have to worry about deficits in the downturn, telling us that we can just print money as the economy nears full employment does not make sense. If we want to have a big GND, we will have to find some ways to pay for it.

We should perhaps not blame politicians who advocate a GND without telling us how they plan to pay for it. After all, Republican politicians have been getting elected for 40 years by promising big tax cuts without saying how they would pay for them. It is understandable that Democrats might think that they should also be able to promise now and pay later.

But, if they tell us that we don’t have to pay for it, they are wrong. The printing press will not do the trick.",Paying for a Green New Deal with Modern Monetary Theory,The Real News,https://therealnews.com/paying-for-a-green-new-deal-with-modern-monetary-theory

Warren already had a toddler when she entered law school before becoming pregnant with her second child, and going on to innovate the field of bankruptcy law that led to an entirely new federal agency, and eventually her bid for Senate. Instead of talking about that astounding feat and how it inspired her policies, Bernie hurled a bomb into the news cycle and my eyeballs are still bleeding.

“ She literally said nothing while he babbled on and on as only a man convinced of his own manifest destiny can. ”

But I completely lost it when Beto O’Rourke launched a video about why he’s also running for president featuring his smiling, voiceless, Stepford-esque—at least in that video—wife.

The video didn’t caption Amy O’Rourke by name, and Beto never even made reference to her. She literally said nothing while he babbled on for three-and-a-half minutes straight as only a man convinced of his own manifest destiny can. Hours later, he had the nerve to joke that, “she is raising, sometimes with my help,” their three kids. Hilarious! I love when women get to serve as accessories to their absentee husbands as they take road trips to discover America, and themselves (he later apologized for the remark, but the reality of their arrangement stands).

I have another idea for Bernie, Beto, and Joe Biden, who recently called the gay-hating, anti-abortion Mike Pence “a decent guy:” Don’t.

There are four highly qualified women running in the Democratic primary—across a range of ideologies and experience—but an influx of men have entered the mix without offering a clear rationale for themselves beyond that they can and want to run. That’s not to mention several pathetic hints that they’d make things right by adding one of those woman to the bottom of their ticket, sort of like Geraldine Ferraro, who made history as the first Democratic female nominee for vice president 35 years ago.

“ ‘Not Us, But Me’: There’s no reason for Sanders to run this time around with Warren in the field, but instead of helping her become the first female President he’s centering himself. ”

I voted proudly for Bernie in the 2016 Democratic primary, and defended him against charges of sexism. Now I can’t stand the sight of his name in my inbox proclaiming “not me, us,” if I’ll just chip in $3. This isn’t the improbable populist who stepped off the sidelines to wrest control of the Democratic Party from its centrist drift into corporate dependence. That man started a movement that produced shockwaves across the country, and in Congress with the election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others.

There’s no substantive reason to run this time around with Warren in the field, but instead of helping his ideological twin become the first female president, he’s centering himself. “Not us, but me,” seems more accurate.

Beto, too, seems to think that one more white man would be the best way to address the shameful lack of gender and racial diversity in American politics. In a substance-free Vanity Fair profile announcing his run, he evinced a fleeting sense of self-awareness that his demographic is already over-represented. His solution? To pack his administration with women and people of color, because, “it’s the only way I know to meet that challenge.”

Think harder, bro, and maybe find a way to support a more qualified candidate like Stacy Abrams, who registered a record number of African-American voters, while serving as the first black woman minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives and eventually running for governor herself. Unlike Beto who lost his campaign for Senate against Ted Cruz by over 200,000 votes, the self- made Abrams actually held a lead until the election was stolen out from under her. Afterwards, she went back to work building democracy and he went on what Danielle Tcholakian called a “vision quest.” All of this amidst an avalanche of media attention furiously devoted to his future presidential prospects. I guess it’s not that surprising that a guy who coasted into El Paso politics thanks to his well-connected family can’t figure out a better way to advance others except to run for office himself.

As to Biden, who hasn’t even officially announced, can you not?

That’s the question a bunch of straight, white guys asked in 2016 when they created an eponymous PAC as a joke, challenging, “brogressives and others to reject any notion that they are uniquely qualified or positioned to seek political office.” Contrary to Beto’s claim that he was “born for this,” the PAC’s founders argue instead that, “as well-represented White dudes, we feel it is our obligation to know when to shut up and Not.” Apparently #notallwhiteguys though. On Monday, NPR’s Rachel Martin noted that the Democratic field is now full of candidates who sound an awful lot like Bernie Sanders. Putting the question to the 77-year-old senator straight, she asked: “So why do you need to run?” His response? “Well, maybe the more appropriate question is, 'Why do they need to run?’” Um, no dude that is not an answer. As if on cue, the campaign yesterday released a list of new hires, most of them women, which only made me more angry to see them tokenized as the power behind the throne.

This isn’t just about what some people dismiss as “identity politics.” It’s that these particular white men are benefiting from an unspoken, but implicit bias that a woman can’t win against Trump. Every time Governor Andrew Cuomo ambiguously refers to Biden “as the most credible” candidate, it’s just a stand in for “a guy that angry white men will relate to who’s not a shrill harpy obsessed with lady stuff.”

Make no mistake: Credibility is a scam and these guys think they can sell Democrats on themselves as the last indispensable man.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going.

A new Israel political advocacy organization called Pro-Israel America has been launched in the US to help voters identify pro-Israel Congressional candidates to vote for and donate to their political campaigns.



The organization formally launched on Tuesday and announced its endorsement of 27 candidates for races for 2020 Congressional races, including 13 Republicans and 14 Democrats who have been strong advocates for the US-Israel alliance.

Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, Executive Director of Pro-Israel America Jeff Mendelsohn said that there were “growing challenges” to the US-Israel relationship and that there is a need to get more pro-Israel members of the public involved in efforts to bolster it.Concern has been voiced of late regarding support in the Democratic Party for Israel and a new poll by the Pew Research Center published last week found that support for Israel among Democrats is at a two-decade low.Pro-Palestinian freshmen members of Congress, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, have shaken the Jewish establishment by strongly challenging US and Democratic support for Israel, although antisemitic statements made by the pair have generated considerable push-back.Mendelsohn, who has previously worked as the national outreach director for AIPAC, remains positive, however, that support for Israel and America’s relationship with the Jewish state within the Democratic Party is still high.“Democrats in Congress remain strong in their support for Israel, and while there are always people who disagree, there is still tremendous support for the relationship,” he said.Mendelsohn argued that there is an untapped wellspring of support for Israel among the general US public, and that Pro-Israel America was coming to “galvanize” that support and provide a mechanism for such people to express that support.The organization’s website will serve as a resource to help people identify which candidates in their districts are pro-Israel and which have been endorsed by the organization. It will also provide the means to donate to such candidates’ political campaigns directly or through the Pro-Israel America PAC itself.“We see a need and an opportunity to get more people involved in the process on both sides of the aisle, and to create a one-stop shop to get them information about candidates and congressional races, and provide voters with online resource to show the opinions of the candidates,” said Mendelsohn.The organization will not, however, be targeting candidates it believes are unsupportive of the US-Israel relationship. The organization was endorsed by former congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and former senator Joe Lieberman.

Addressing a press conference here, Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam (SASS) General Secretary Erode Rajan said that they have been meeting various parties in the national capital with their 18-point charter of demands and whoever agrees to it will get its full support.

“There are about 4.5-5 crore devotees of Ayyappa from southern states and elsewhere. Every devotee has at least four voters in his/her family, that makes it 20 crore voters in all… We have decided that whoever supports our demands, will get our backing. We will issue instructions to the devotees to that effect,” he said.

The SASS gave its charter to the Communist Party of India-Marxist, which leads the Left Democratic Front government in the state, on Tuesday, and will give the same to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress on Wednesday. It said it expected to get a reply from them within two to three days.

The decision was taken at a National Executive meeting held by the SASS during February 23-24 in Bengaluru.

A controversy erupted in Kerala after the Supreme Court’s September 28, 2018 verdict allowing women of all ages entry to Sabarimala, the ancient temple of deity Ayyappa, who is considered a celibate according to legends.

The temple has become a hotbed for clashes between the Ayyappa devotees who are against the decision and those who support it.

The other demands of the Samajam include, taking Sabarimala and other temples connected with it taken out of government control and handed over to an autonomous body made up of devotees and temple authorities.

The resolution is seen to benefit the BJP, which has been opposing the entry of women to Sabarimala and is now very likely to accept the demands also.

Moldovan president urges new parliament to seek compromise in putting together govt (Part 2) CHISINAU. March 21 (Interfax) - Moldovan President Igor Dodon has called on the members of the newly-elected parliament to seek a compromise in forming a government. ""The people expect you to make sure that the new parliament starts working as soon as possible. I urge you to seek a compromise and a dialogue,"" Dodon said at the first session of the new parliament on Thursday. ""I urge you to sit down at the negotiating table, discuss all matters so as to set up a legitimate parliamentary majority and endorse a government composition. I urge you not to fall victim to political arrogance, to sit at the negotiating table and start a constructive dialogue,"" he said. Dodon also said he intended to invite the leaders of all parliamentary parties to hold consultations on the matter. ""I will sign a decree on nominating a candidacy for prime minister representing a ruling coalition. But only provided that this majority is set up on a legitimate basis, in accordance with the election's outcomes. I won't agree to a candidacy for prime minister if it is nominated by a coalition including defecting parliamentarians or in some other way. In this case, I believe it would be better if our people make a decision in new early elections,"" Dodon said. An Interfax correspondent reported that the first session of the new Moldovan parliament lasted for less than one hour. The session was chaired by the oldest parliamentarian, a 79-year-old Eduard Smirnov of the Party of Socialists. Representatives of three factions; the Party of Socialists, the Democratic Party, and the Shor Party, said at the session that they put together parliamentary factions numbering 35, 30, and seven lawmakers respectively. The rightwing ACUM bloc said it needed more time to decide on forming one or more factions. The law allots ten days for this. Smirnov, who chaired the session, acknowledged that no parliamentary majority had been established at the parliament and therefore the session could not be continued. Following this, a recess was called. The date and time of a new session will be announced later. Four parties won parliamentary seats in the recent parliamentary elections in Moldova. The pro-Russian Party of Socialists (PSRM) got 35, the Democratic Party (PDM) 30, the rightwing ACUM bloc 26, and the Shor Party seven mandates. Three unaffiliated candidates who won in their single-mandate constituencies will also be represented in parliament. The Constitutional Court confirmed the parliamentary mandates last Saturday. The PSRM earlier invited ACUM to start talks to build a parliamentary majority, but the latter categorically refused to collaborate with either the Socialists or the Democrats. The establishment of a coalition now seems unlikely, as there are fundamental disagreements between all the parliamentary parties. Most analysts view early elections as a more likely outcome. va rm kl (Our editorial staff can be reached at eng.editors@interfax.ru) /Interfax/ Subscription You can access a demo version of, receive more information about or subscribe to Interfax publications by filling in and returning the form below.

Getty Images Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announces her presidential bid in front of a crowd gathered at Boom Island Park on Feb. 10, 2019, in Minneapolis.

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said President Donald Trump's rhetoric exacerbated tensions and called for him to condemn bigotry against Muslims.

""I don't think you can actually take each of the murderous acts and say what role Donald Trump played, but I can tell you this: his rhetoric doesn't help,"" Klobuchar said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""And many of these people, whether it was the person who tried to bomb Barack Obama or this murderer in New Zealand, have cited Donald Trump along the way.""

Klobuchar spoke with CNN from Iowa as she vies for her party's presidential nomination to challenge Trump next year. She said after the recent attack on Muslims in New Zealand, it was ""on all of us to condemn this hate,"" including Trump.

""He, at the very least, should be giving strong statements, public speeches, defending Muslims in this world,"" Klobuchar said.

Trump said on Friday after the shooting he had called New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but when asked about white nationalism, he said he did not regard it as a growing threat.

Available data suggest white nationalism is a rising, violent threat in the United States, as CNN noted in a fact check on Trump's comments.

In Sunday's interview, Klobuchar also defended the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who Trump attacked on Twitter over the weekend. Klobuchar called the tweets ""outrageous"" and invoked McCain's memory as she called for unity in the wake of the New Zealand massacre.

""John believed, as I believe, that when a tragedy happens like in New Zealand, you do all you can to reach out to that country and you do all you can to stand up for the simple belief that people are different in our country, but we were all part of a greater America,"" Klobuchar said.",Klobuchar after New Zealand attack: Trump's 'rhetoric doesn't help',channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/klobuchar-after-new-zealand-attack-trumps-rhetoric-doesnt-help/1060178778

Speaking to reporters before beginning the third day of her campaign along the river Ganga on Wednesday, she said, “BJP has systematically attacked every democratic institution in the country in the last five years. You all know it better than I do.

“So I think the Prime Minister should stop thinking that people are fools and understand that they see through all his antics.”

On Wednesday, Priyanka, who is also Congress’ in-charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, is in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency, Varanasi.

Starting her day with an interaction with party workers at the Chunar Fort, she paid tributes to Lal Bahadur Shastri at the Shastri Chowk and Shastri Memorial, the house of the former Prime Minister in his ancestral village Ramnagar.

Congress workers followed her around raising slogans like “Gali gali me shor hai, chowkidar’ chor hai” and “Dahan karne Modi ki Lanka, aa gai behen Priyanka”.

Locals seemed motivated by the Congress leader’s arrival in their midst, with many pointing out her resemblance to her grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Sanjay Kumar said, “Her arrival augurs a change. People are looking for a new ideology. Now people want to get away from the politics of temple and mosque.”

“We have felt helpless in the last five years, we feel cheated by the government,” he added.

Shahnawaz, another local told IANS, “The BJP has not lived up to our expecations. We see a hope in Priyanka Gandhi and the Congress.”

Priyanka took the boat ride from the Ramnagar Ghat to Assi Ghat, where she will interact with the locals — mainly fishermen, people of the Jain community and women.

Later in the day, the Congress leader will offer prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple on the Dashashwamedh Ghat.

This will be Priyanka’s fourth temple visit since March 18, when she kicked off her river ride from Prayagraj on Monday.

On Monday, she visited the famous Hanuman Mandir in Prayagraj, followed by trips to the Sita Samahit Sthal temple in Bhadohi’s Sitamarhi and the Vindhyavashini temple in Vindhyachal on the second day of her campaign. She also offered a chadar at Kantit Sharif dargah on Tuesday.

The Congress leader will also meet her party workers in Varanasi and visit the homes of three Central Reserve Force Police (CRPF) troopers who died in the February 14 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama.

She will meet the family members of Avadhesh Yadav in Chandauli district. On her way back to Varanasi, she will meet the families of Vishal Pandey and Ramesh Yadav.

The vote on the House bill was partisan, and Sen. Bill Cowsert from the 46th District, Rep. Houston Gaines from House District 117, and Rep. Marcus Wiedower from House District 119, all Republicans, sided with the Republican majority.

All of Oconee County falls into the 46th Senate District, and 10 of Oconee County’s 13 precincts are in the 119th, with the remaining three in the 117th House District.

Clarke County is the dominant part of both the 117th and 119th, by registration, and makes up a significant part of the 46th Senate District.

Rep. Spencer Frye, a Democrat representing House District 118, which falls entirely in Clarke County, voted against the bill.

Sen. Frank Ginn, a Republican whose Senate District 47 includes parts of Clarke County, voted in favor of the bill, which now is on the desk of Gov. Brian Kemp awaiting his expected approval.

The partisan nature of the choice of voting machines surfaced in the February meeting of the Oconee County Democratic Party, where Oconee County Elections and Registration Director Fran Davis spoke on the operation of her office.

Gregory Meeks (D-Queens, Nassau) needed zero time to reflect last Friday when asked about his priorities as the brand-new chairman of the Queens County Democratic Committee.

“Promoting party unity — and getting Melinda Katz elected as district attorney.”

Meeks made the comments at the ribbon cutting for the new JFK Redevelopment Community Information Center [see separate story in some editions or online at qhron.com] four days after being picked to succeed longtime chairman Joe Crowley.

Just which one would be tougher than the other is subject to debate. Borough President Katz is in a seven-way primary race to replace DA Richard Brown, who will step down in June after previously announcing he would not seek re-election this year due to health concerns.

Katz has been endorsed by the party in a contest that includes Tiffany Caban, Councilman Rory Lancman (D-Fresh Meadows), Greg Lasak, Betty Lugo, Mina Malik and Jose Nieves.

As for unity, Meeks doesn’t have to get back on the shuttle to Washington, DC to be faced with fractious politics. The man Meeks succeeded last week was unseated by U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bronx, Queens), who has been both outspoken and a lightning rod since defeating Crowley. She also has inspired a strong positive reaction among progressives in The World’s Borough.

The Center, New York City’s LGBTQ+ community center, has raised the ire of New York’s queer community for scheduling an #LGBTTownHall hosted by #WalkAway, a movement founded by gay man and former liberal Brandon Straka. The aim of the movement is to get LGBTQ+ people to abandon the Democratic party in favor of Republicans. The event is scheduled to take place on Thursday, March 28.

Jason Rosenberg tweeted a screenshot of an ad for the event, which ran in the LGBTQ+ publication Get Out Magazine, on Monday. Rosenberg is a member of ACT UP, the AIDS activist group that has met weekly at the LGBT Center since its inception in 1987.

The ad says that Democrats use “lies, fear mongering, fake news, hate and division” to keep people in the party’s ranks.

“This is incredibly egregious that you’d host an event where panelists have used queer slurs and stood behind policies that put the community at great risk,” Rosenberg wrote in a subsequent tweet. “Stand for something.”

In a phone interview with Out, Rosenberg said his deepest concern is the “betrayal and testing of trust” for those who, like him, use the center for organizing and movement building.

“I think the fear mongering and hate speech that will fill that room encroaches on our ability to do our work properly,” he says.

The event’s advertisement says that the town hall includes #WalkAway founder Brandon Straka, as well as conservative transgender YouTuber Blaire White, political commentator Rob Smith and writer Mike Harlow.

White has made a name for herself as a conservative transgender commentator who echoes the same demeaning points that you can hear from people like Piers Morgan or find elsewhere in the recesses of YouTube’s thriving alt-right culture. She’s published videos to her YouTube with titles like “There Are Only 2 Genders,” “Fat Acceptance is Stupid,” and videos against so-called “social justice warriors” like “Special Snowflake Syndrome.” In one video, she mocked people who identify as nonbinary or genderqueer, calling the identities “largely bullshit.”

""I think they’re super meaningless,"" White says. ""I think the people who take them on are usually extremely boring and have nothing else to their personality other than: 'I’m demi-queer nonbinary gender-fuck special snowflake kin.'""

Smith is a Black gay conservative and veteran who has previously said that coming out as gay has been harder than coming out as a conservative.

CNN called the Walk Away campaign “pure propaganda” and a “psychological operation” in July, ahead of the 2018 midterms. The outlet cited evidence that bots linked to Russia were using the #WalkAway hashtag to influence the election’s outcome. Think Progress knocked the movement, and its October 2018 march in Washington, D.C., as having all the hallmark signs of a “grifting operation,” including $85 brunch tickets, $250 dinner tickets, $300 VIP cocktail hour tickets, and a $10,000 package that included a photo-op. The movement has also come under scrutiny for ads that purported to feature people who had walked away from the Democratic party, but who were actually just stock photo models. Snopes verified that the images were stock photo models, though could not confirm whether #WalkAway had indeed created the images themselves.

The LGBT Center responded to the controversy with a statement, which it tweeted out Wednesday afternoon. In the statement, the Center said that as a non-partisan organization, it does not “support or endorse activities held by groups renting our space.”

“We acknowledge the diversity of our community’s perspectives, and while we may be disgusted by or reject the ideas some groups espouse, we will not stand in the way of their right to say them,” it added. “Our responsibility is to provide space for connecting and organizing across our diverse viewpoints, not to censor.”

We acknowledge the diversity of our community's perspectives, and while we may be disgusted by or reject the ideas some groups espouse, we will not stand in the way of their right to say them. — The Center (@LGBTCenterNYC) March 20, 2019

Rosenberg called the Center’s response “politician-like” and “stilted.”

“It sounded like they were speaking from the government when they're the LGBT community center of New York City and they have full time staff that work on progressive issues and work on community building,” he says.

Get Out Magazine also responded to Rosenberg’s initial tweet.

Everyone gets a voice in my America Sorry guys I live in a country of freedom of speech. how I grew up is to listen and speak .i listen to everyone and make my own choice But I do live in this country with many other ppl #living in a world together with free speech — Get Out! Magazine (@GetOutMag) March 20, 2019

“Everyone gets a voice in my America. Sorry guys,” the response read. “I live in a country of freedom of speech. How I grew up is to listen and speak. I listen to everyone and make my own choice. But I do live in this country with many other people #living in a world together with free speech.”

Journalist Lauren Duca recently wrote an op-ed for Out unpacking “the mind-numbing paradigm of ‘both sidesism,’” and the way it hinders the progressivism of a national conversation. “Engaging with different political viewpoints is not the same thing as sponsoring hate speech,” Duca writes.

Other LGBTQ+ resource centers responded to the statement, as well. In a series of tweets, South Carolina’s Harriet Hancock LGBT Center mentioned the “tolerance paradox,” or the philosophical notion that, when society tolerates intolerance, it leads to the extinction of tolerance.

”When we extend tolerance to those who are openly intolerant, the tolerant ones end up being destroyed. And tolerance with them.” (2/3) — LGBTCenterSC (@LGBTCenterSC) March 21, 2019

Rosenberg says that his hope, and the hope of other community members who use the space, is not just that the event be cancelled, but that this sort of event not happen again.

“We want to confront this in a meaningful way,” he says. “Because this happened, it tested our trust at the Center and so, we need to build a better system where this will never happen again.”

He called the event a “stain” on the Center’s legacy.

“This place is the start of SAGE and ACT UP,” he adds. “It’s such a historic space and to think that this is what we’re dealing with, I found it really hurtful.”

TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan and the U.S. will hold talks later this year as part of upgraded efforts to counter Beijing's growing pressure on the island for political unification.

The talks planned for September in Taipei will include a senior official from Washington, de facto U.S. ambassador to Taipei William Brent Christensen said Tuesday.

Christensen didn't say whether the consultations are meant to provoke China or push it to make changes. The U.S. has formal diplomatic relations with China but maintains strong ties with Taiwan though the American Institute in Taiwan, its de facto embassy in Taipei, which has recently undergone a major upgrade in facilities.

""We believe it's possible to have a good relationship with Taiwan and a good relationship with China at the same time,"" Christensen said at a news conference. ""Things we do with Taiwan should not be regarded as things that we are doing because we are seeking to provoke China or vice versa.""

President Donald Trump has elevated 40 years of informal ties with Taiwan through more open contacts and planned arms deals. Meanwhile, China and the U.S. are enmeshed in a dispute over trade, copyrights and tariffs, raising economic and political frictions to their highest level in a decade.

Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the ""Indo-Pacific Democratic Governance Consultations"" — as the dialogue is termed — would allow the two sides to ""grow closer and more direct in their co-operation ... to protect regional freedom and legal order.""

Taiwan has been democratically ruled for about 30 years. It allows freedom of expression and religion in contrast to China's tight restrictions under authoritarian Communist Party rule, and remains a close U.S. ally in the Asia-Pacific region.

While China insists that Taiwan is its territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary, more than 70 per cent of Taiwanese oppose China's goal of unification, the government's Mainland Affairs Council spokesman said in January. Many fear Beijing would eliminate Taiwan's democratic institutions.

While there was no immediate word from Beijing, China will ""most definitely"" protest the consultations, said Shane Lee, a political scientist at Chang Jung Christian University in Taiwan.

China has used military flybys, aircraft carrier movements and diplomatic pressure as warnings to Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen took office there in 2016. Tsai's party embraces greater Taiwanese independence from China, resulting in a strong backlash from China. Beijing has cut all formal ties with Tsai's government, blockaded the island's participation in international forums and persuaded five countries to cut diplomatic ties with it.

New Zealand imposed a ban on assault weapons Thursday, moving swiftly following the Christchurch massacre and triggering renewed calls from leading American politicians for gun controls in the United States.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons were now banned with immediate effect, making good on a pledge to the country of the military-style weapons used in last week's slaughter of 50 people.

The killings at two Christchurch mosques by an Australian white supremacist have caused national soul-searching over New Zealand's lax gun laws.

But the crackdown promises to have political repercussions beyond the country's shores, including in the United States where gun control is one of the most divisive national political issues.

""In short, every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned in this country,"" Ardern said.

She added that high-capacity magazines and devices similar to bump stocks -- which allow users to fire weapons faster -- will also be banned.

Proponents of gun control in the United States and around the world praised the move and denounced the powerful US pro-gun lobby on social media, while American gun supporters defended their constitutional right to bear arms.

- 'Follow NZ's lead' -

""This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like,"" Democratic US Senator and presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders tweeted.

""We must follow New Zealand's lead, take on the NRA (National Rifle Association) and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in the United States.""

High-profile Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez contrasted Ardern's swift action with US failure to enact even modest controls following recurring horrific shootings such as at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012, in which 20 children and six school staff died.

""Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can't even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

""Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market. This is what leadership looks like.""

US President Donald Trump did not immediately react on his Twitter feed, but NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch responded to Sanders by tweeting that ""the US isn't NZ.""

""While they do not have an inalienable right to bear arms and to self defense, we do,"" she said.

Accused shooter Brenton Tarrant livestreamed the carnage in real-time, sparking worldwide revulsion and concern over access to guns and the use of social media by extremists.

Tarrant had written that he planned to use firearms for his attacks to encourage US gun control advocates to push for curbs, thus tearing open the bitter political debate.

""This attempted abolishment of rights by the left will result in a dramatic polarization of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the US along cultural and racial lines,"" he wrote.

New Zealand's ban includes interim measures to prevent a run on such guns before legislation is enacted, and outlawing weapons already in private possession.

Guns are to be handed in and destroyed via a buyback scheme that will cost between Nz$100 million and $200 million (between US$69 million and $139 million), depending on how many are received and their valuations.

- A changed nation -

NZ Police Commissioner Michael Bush said there were around a quarter of a million firearms users in New Zealand, but he did not give a breakdown on how many possess semi-automatics.

Conservative estimates indicate some 1.5 million weapons are in circulation in New Zealand, equating to three guns for every 10 people, well below the US ratio of more than one weapon per person.

""The vast majority of New Zealanders will support this change. I feel incredibly confident of that,"" Ardern said.

Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, embraced the ban and pledged to work with the government on it.

""The terrorist attack in Christchurch last week has changed us as a nation,"" Bridges said.

""We agree that the public doesn't need access to military-style semi-automatic weapons.""

Initial public reaction was positive in the still-shocked country, where hundreds of people turned out for a second day for sombre funerals in Christchurch.

The Associated Press





And then there was one more. And maybe one more still to come?

The large crop of Democrats who want to be president grew, technically, when New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand changed her status Sunday from exploring a 2020 White House run to becoming a full-fledged candidate. She'd spent more than a month visiting states to gauge support for a campaign, so voters likely considered her already in the race.

Not yet in, but perhaps tantalizingly close is former Vice-President Joe Biden, who told Delaware Democrats in a speech Saturday night that he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.” He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then added, “I didn't mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.

Biden has been known to go off script, so it not clear whether his remark could turn out to be a case of accidentally telling the truth.

But on Sunday, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who was at the Delaware Democrats' dinner, told ABC's “This Week,” ”Well, I'm very optimistic that Joe Biden will soonformally announce his campaign for the presidency.“

One hopeful, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, said he has met a fundraising threshold to participate in this summer's debates. He said he has received donations from more than 65,000 individual donors.

The Democratic National Committee said last month up to 20 candidates can qualify for the debates by collecting donations from at least 65,000 individuals, with at least 200 unique donors in at least 20 states. They also can qualify by reaching 1 per cent support in at least three national or early primary state polls.

In an email to supporters, Buttigieg said “we weren't even close” to 65,000 donors when the party announced the requirement, but that more than 76,000 people have now donated.

The debates will be held in June and July.

Another busy day of weekend campaigning has former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke in Wisconsin, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in Iowa and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in Tennessee.","New York Sen.

This has created some concern, as many credit her with navigating her country, the European Union and even the global community through many stormy waters in recent years.

When we look around the world, however, we see that there is no reason to fear. Numerous politicians of tremendous integrity are stepping forward. What’s striking is how many of these leaders are women.

Though Elizabeth May remains the only Green Party member of Parliament, non-partisan Canadians tend to trust her word above all others with regard to happenings in government.

In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau purposely chose a significant number of women to form his cabinet. Is it a coincidence that among them are the very people who have put their own careers on the line by questioning the ethics of his administration?

The recent mid-term congressional elections in the United States also unleashed the power of women of integrity in politics. The number of women now serving in both houses of Congress is 127, the highest in history.

Of the 116 women recently elected, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been the most visible. However, she is not the only person challenging the status quo. Other new members in the U.S. include the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress, Indigenous women and representatives of other significant minority groups.

The vast majority of American citizens have watched their democratic rights diminish over the last several decades as the result of the influence of corporatist lobbyists, who pay for ‘their guy’ to get elected, as well as by their own increasing political apathy.

These new congressional representatives, however, are stepping forward and saying, “Enough is enough! This is a democracy, of the people, by the people and for the people, and our government is failing us. We need to make changes.”

They’re empowering the common person to take part in the political process.

What’s also incredibly hopeful is the similarity in background of many of the new representatives. A significant number are relatively young women from immigrant backgrounds. They seem to have come from nowhere in the last few years to take their places in one of the most powerful and influential law-making bodies in the world.

The fact is they didn’t come out of nowhere and that’s what’s most encouraging. They have a history of grassroots social activism and community involvement.

Ocasio-Cortez sparked tremendous hope and interest due to the uniqueness of her story. As a young bartender of limited means, she was able to not only win the Democratic nomination for her constituency in New York City, she defeated Joe Crowley, one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives. Her approach required limited financial investment and relied on a message of empowerment to previously disempowered citizens.

Of course, it’s not only women who are capable of leading with integrity, and it’s not only the young who have the courage to stand up to corruption. Every citizen, elected or not, has the responsibility of holding their government accountable.

It is, however, encouraging and inspiring to see women take on these roles in our legislatures.

The Year of the Woman in 2018 was one of significant change. Those who put themselves on the line to be champions of integrity deserve our support, and they call on all of us to be active citizens and do the right thing.

EDMONTON — The staffer at the centre of a spreading scandal over Alberta's United Conservative leadership race says party leader Jason Kenney's team did not direct and prop up a bogus candidate to attack Kenney's main rival.

In a letter obtained by The Canadian Press, Matt Wolf says that when he worked on Kenney's campaign, he shared policy and research ideas with the campaign of Jeff Callaway — but Callaway was his own boss.

""To be clear, this was not a 'puppet'-type operation,"" Wolf wrote in an email to the UCP caucus Sunday morning.

""Mr. Callaway made his own decisions for his own reasons. And while communicating with the Callaway campaign was hardly my preoccupation during the leadership (race), I did, at times push things like research materials to Mr. Callaway's team.""

Wolf also said he is not aware of anyone on Kenney's team illicitly funding Callaway's campaign.

Such funding would violate Alberta's election finance laws. Alberta's elections commissioner has already fined one UCP member for making such an illegal contribution to the Callaway campaign, and the CBC has reported that the RCMP has now taken over the funding aspect of the investigation.

""Our leadership campaign did not in any way funnel donations to the Callaway camp — an act that would clearly be in violation of the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act,"" wrote Wolf, who is currently Kenney's deputy chief of staff for the UCP caucus.

""I am very confident that even a suggestion of doing so would firmly be rejected by our campaign's leadership team at the time, and rightly so.""

Wolf could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.

He wrote the letter just hours after CBC published a story and supporting documents late Saturday night detailing communications between the two campaigns.

In those documents, later obtained by The Canadian Press, Wolf is shown in emails and other exchanges giving Callaway's organizers talking points, speech and policy advice on attacking Kenney's main rival in the race, Brian Jean.

One piece of correspondence discussed when Callaway should drop out of the race — something he eventually did three weeks before voting day on Oct. 28, 2017, throwing his support to Kenney.

Callaway was one of three rivals for the UCP leadership. The party was created after Kenney's Progressive Conservatives and Brian Jean's Wildrose party voted to merge.

Jean was seen as Kenney's main rival in the race. Kenney defeated Jean and candidate Doug Schweitzer handily, with 61 per cent of the vote. Jean garnered 32 per cent.

Callaway, who had worked with Jean in the Wildrose party, repeatedly attacked Jean during the campaign in speeches, events and media scrums, questioning his policy ideas and financial management of the Wildrose.

Callaway could not be reached for comment.

The UCP did not make Kenney available Sunday, but the party's executive director, Janice Harrington released a statement.

It read: ""Communication between leadership campaigns is perfectly normal in a preferential ballot election and was within the rules of the 2017 UCP leadership election.""

Kenney and Callaway have previously denied that their campaigns worked together, and Wolf said in his letter that while his emails may look ""unflattering,"" the correspondence is normal practice among rival camps in politics.

Premier Rachel Notley, in a speech to supporters on Sunday, said Kenney already showed questionable judgment recently when his staff staked out and filmed a political opponent.

""But an alleged conspiracy to torpedo an opponent's leadership campaign takes it to a whole other level,"" Notley told supporters at her Edmonton-Strathcona nomination meeting.

""Mr. Kenney owes Albertans a full accounting, not just empty denials.... Mr. Kenney has demonstrated a profound absence of integrity, and Albertans deserve better.""

She later told reporters that it appeared more was going on than just communication between campaigns.

""It appears to me like people in Mr. Kenney's campaign were essentially running the other campaign,"" Notley said.

Derek Fildebrandt, a former UCP legislature member now running against Kenney as the head of the new Freedom Conservative party, said in a statement the documents show Kenney's ""willingness to do or say anything to obtain power; to corrupt and abuse the grassroots democratic promise to achieve his own ends.""

The allegations come at a super-heated time in Alberta politics.

Politicians return to the legislature Monday for a throne speech to begin a new session. The session could end at any time when Premier Rachel Notley decides to call the election.

By law, the 28-day campaign and vote must be held before June 1.

Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, embraced the ...","Wellington - New Zealand imposed an immediate ban on assault weapons on Thursday, taking swift action in response to the Christchurch massacre and triggering renewed calls from leading American politicians for curbs in the United States.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons would be banned with immediate effect, making good on a pledge to ensure that nothing like last week's slaughter of 50 people ever occurs in the Pacific nation again.

The killings by an Australian white supremacist have caused national soul-searching over New Zealand's lax gun laws.

But the tough crackdown promises to have political repercussions beyond the country's shores, including in the United States where gun control is one of the most divisive political issues.

“In short, every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned in this country,” Ardern said.

She added that high-capacity magazines and devices similar to bump stocks, which allow users to fire weapons faster, will also be banned.

Proponents of gun control in the United States and around the world praised the move and denounced the US pro-gun lobby on social media, while American gun supporters defended their constitutional right to bear arms.

“This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like,” Democratic US Senator and presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders tweeted.

“We must follow New Zealand's lead, take on the NRA (National Rifle Association) and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in the United States.”

High-profile Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez contrasted the swift ban with US failure to enact even modest controls following recurring deadly shootings such as the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012, in which 20 children and six school staff died.

“Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can't even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

“Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market. This is what leadership looks like.”

No reaction was immediately seen on the Twitter feed of US President Donald Trump.

Alleged shooter Brenton Tarrant livestreamed the carnage in real-time, and the horrific scenes have heightened global concern over access to guns and the use of social media by extremists.

New Zealand's steps include interim measures to prevent any rush to purchase guns before legislation is enacted and effectively outlaw all such weapons already in private possession.

“The effect of this will mean that no one will be able to buy these weapons without a permit to procure from the police. I can assure people that there is no point in applying for such a permit,” Ardern said.

For the guns already out there, Ardern announced a buyback scheme that will cost between US$69m and $139m, depending on the number of weapons received and valuations.

“The vast majority of New Zealanders will support this change. I feel incredibly confident of that,” she said.

Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, embraced the ban, pledging to “work constructively” with the government.

Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, embraced ...","New Zealand imposed an immediate ban on assault weapons on Thursday, taking swift action in response to the Christchurch massacre and triggering renewed calls from leading American politicians for curbs in the United States.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons would be banned with immediate effect, making good on a pledge to ensure that nothing like last week's slaughter of 50 people ever occurs in the Pacific nation again.

The killings by an Australian white supremacist have caused national soul-searching over New Zealand's lax gun laws.

But the tough crackdown promises to have political repercussions beyond the country's shores, including in the United States where gun control is one of the most divisive political issues.

""In short, every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned in this country,"" Ardern said.

She added that high-capacity magazines and devices similar to bump stocks – which allow users to fire weapons faster – will also be banned.

Proponents of gun control in the United States and around the world praised the move and denounced the US pro-gun lobby on social media, while American gun supporters defended their constitutional right to bear arms.

'Follow NZ's lead'

""This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like,"" Democratic US Senator and presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders tweeted.

""We must follow New Zealand's lead, take on the NRA (National Rifle Association) and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in the United States.""

High-profile Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez contrasted the swift ban with US failure to enact even modest controls following recurring deadly shootings such as the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012, in which 20 children and six school staff died.

""Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can't even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

""Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market. This is what leadership looks like.""

No reaction was immediately seen on the Twitter feed of US President Donald Trump.

Alleged shooter Brenton Tarrant livestreamed the carnage in real-time, and the horrific scenes have heightened global concern over access to guns and the use of social media by extremists.

New Zealand's steps include interim measures to prevent any rush to purchase guns before legislation is enacted and effectively outlaw all such weapons already in private possession.

""The effect of this will mean that no one will be able to buy these weapons without a permit to procure from the police. I can assure people that there is no point in applying for such a permit,"" Ardern said.

For the guns already out there, Ardern announced a buyback scheme that will cost between Nz$100m and $200m (between $69m and $139m), depending on the number of weapons received and valuations.

'A good thing'

""The vast majority of New Zealanders will support this change. I feel incredibly confident of that,"" she said.

Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, embraced the ban, pledging to ""work constructively"" with the government.

""The terrorist attack in Christchurch last week has changed us as a nation,"" Bridges said in a statement.

The hottest position in the Democratic presidential field this week is abolishing the Electoral College.

White House hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg have either called for the abolition of the Electoral College or said it’s an idea they’re open to. It’s the latest push by White House hopefuls to embrace a procedural tactic to rally the Democratic base, following similar calls to scrap the filibuster and increase the size of the Supreme Court.

The Green New Deal and “Medicare for All” are old news. The hottest position in the Democratic presidential field this week is abolishing the Electoral College.

Elizabeth Warren kicked things off at a CNN town hall Monday night when the Massachusetts senator drew enthusiastic applause by saying: “Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.”

The next day, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said there was “a lot of wisdom” in abolishing the Electoral College. California Sen. Kamala Harris told late night host Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night that she’s “open to the discussion.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, tweeted a clip of him saying the Electoral College “has got to go.”

The 2020 candidates are tapping into Democratic anger after Donald Trump became the second Republican in five presidential elections to win the presidency through the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.

The Electoral College, a group that comes together every four years to technically elect the president, is enshrined in the Constitution and won’t be easy to eliminate. O’Rourke suggested a constitutional amendment to award the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.

Several Democratic-controlled states are pushing for a national popular vote. But rather than pass a constitutional amendment, these legislatures are joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a group of states that pledge to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote.

The compact only goes into effect when it includes states representing 270 electoral votes, the majority needed to win the White House. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis brought the current total to 181 when he signed a bill last week to join the compact, and the Democratic governors of Delaware and New Mexico also have bills on their desk.

Still, with legislative sessions winding down, there are no other states expected to join this year.

Warren endorsed the compact after her town hall. Patrick Rosenstiel of the group pushing the idea said in an interview that converting to a national popular vote is not a partisan issue.

“The way to do it is through state action and we would welcome Sen. Warren, President Trump, anyone who believes” in the popular vote, said Rosenstiel, a self-described “lifelong conservative Republican” who grew tired of his vote not factoring into presidential elections in reliably Democratic Minnesota.

Though the Electoral College favored Trump in 2016, and some analysts predict it could give him an edge in 2020, it is not necessarily a pro-GOP institution. During Barack Obama’s presidency, many predicted he may benefit from an Electoral College advantage.

That led to criticism of the institution at the time from some Republicans, notably, Trump himself. “The electoral college is a disaster for democracy,” Trump tweeted on the evening of the 2012 election, before it was apparent Obama had also won the national popular vote.

Now that the institution made him president, Trump takes a warmer view. “The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play,” he tweeted Tuesday.

Critics say the Electoral College focuses attention on a handful of swing states at the expense of candidates campaigning throughout the country.

But defenders say the current system almost always lines up with the popular vote and is part of the way the country’s founders wanted to check popular passions and encourages attention to small states that may otherwise get passed over.

Some Democrats agree.

Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur running for the party’s presidential nomination, tweeted: “The problem with deciding Presidential elections via popular vote is that candidates would naturally campaign in urban areas with big media markets and their policies would follow suit. Better to have proportional electoral college votes in each state so you campaign everywhere.”",Democratic presidential hopefuls back ending the Electoral College,The Press Democrat,https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/9413523-181/democratic-presidential-hopefuls-back-ending

As New Mexico state Senator Gabriel Ramos stated, this courageous decision wasn’t made lightly.","Just when things looked most grim for innocent unborn babies in New Mexico, a bill to codify Roe v. Wade, and legalize abortion up until the moment of birth was shot down by the State Senate in a bipartisan vote.

Just like we told you happened in New York, where the state’s governor signed a bill into law that made it legal to abort a baby at any stage, even up to the moment of birth, New Mexico’s proposed legislation, HB 51, would have decriminalized late-term abortion and infanticide. Moreover, the original bill would have eliminated conscience protections by repealing New Mexico’s only statutory provision allowing a doctor to refuse to participate in abortion on moral grounds.

The extreme abortion bill passed New Mexico’s House last month by 40 – 29. Not surprisingly, New Mexico’s pro-abortion governor seemed confident the bill would also pass through the Senate without a hitch, especially with her party in the majority.

But in a stunning turn-of-events, eight New Mexico Senate Democrats crossed the aisle to stand with Republicans and voted 24-18 against killing innocent babies up to the moment of birth.

By a 24-18 tally, Democratic state Sens. Pete Campos, Carlos Cisneros, Richard Martinez, George Muñoz, Gabriel Ramos, Clemente “Meme” Sanchez, John Arthur Smith, and Senate President Pro Tem Mary Kay Papen proved what a complicated issue abortion is becoming—even in liberal states.

It’s encouraging to see politicians putting aside party rhetoric and voting with their convictions. As New Mexico state Senator Gabriel Ramos stated, this courageous decision wasn’t made lightly.

During an emotional debate, some Democrats struggled to come up with a reason why New Mexico should leave perfectly healthy babies on a hospital table to die. Ramos of Silver City told his chamber, “This is one of the toughest decisions any of us will ever have to make.” But, he went on, “I stand unified against legislation that weakens the defense of life and threatens the dignity of the human being.” While others sometimes spoke through tears, the tension inside the Democratic caucus was obvious.

The bill would have repealed a 50-year-old law that makes performing abortion a crime except in cases of rape or imminent risk to the mother’s health, which is still on the books, though is unenforceable due to Roe v. Wade. Abortion advocates wanted the law stripped from the books altogether.

This is yet another big win in a series of recent victories for life. We told you how we recently scored a major victory when we defended pro-life pregnancy centers in New York City. The pro-abortion city has been weaponizing its disclaimer regulations in an attempt to fine and litigate pro-life pregnancy centers out of business. After the city brought bogus charges against one of our clients, a pro-life pregnancy center, we argued, in our brief and at the hearing, that the case was completely meritless and the charges unfounded. The New York prosecutor was unable to counter our arguments, and the city withdrew its targeted case against these pro-life centers, in an abortion-friendly Manhattan hearing room. That is unprecedented.

We also told you about a huge legal victory for life and for taxpayers in Ohio when the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, in an 11 to 6 decision, ruled that a state can choose to defund Planned Parenthood and any other abortionists.

We had filed an amicus brief at the 6th circuit supporting states’ rights to defund abortion providers, and choose to direct funds to actual family planning services.

This overturned a lower court’s decision that had blocked the state of Ohio from defunding the abortion giant.

This major decision now provides a roadmap to defunding Planned Parenthood of millions of dollars at the state level.

We can – and are – winning for life.

Despite pervasive pressure from the abortion lobby, states are rejecting repulsive pro-abortion laws like the ones New York recently passed and Virginia proposed. Virginia’s bill, which purportedly could have legalized infanticide and was supported by its controversial governor, has since been tabled – an indication that state representatives are choosing to listen to citizens who don’t want to pay for abortions or live in a world where a baby can be killed until the moment of birth.

We are hopeful that more lawmakers around the country will show the same courage and conviction as those in New Mexico.

But the battle is far from over. Other states, like Illinois, Rhode Island, and Vermont, are also considering extreme late-term abortion legislation. The abortion lobby is pushing pro-abortion Leftist candidates and pro-abortion legislation to expand its reach and strengthen its empire.

We recently told you how over 20 states are actually suing, along with Planned Parenthood, to continue funding abortion providers, after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ruled that Title X money is not supposed to pay for abortion. We filed formal legal comments with HHS supporting this critical rule that would defund nearly $60 million of your taxpayer dollars from Planned Parenthood. The ACLJ legal team is reviewing these pro-abortion lawsuits and preparing to file amicus briefs to defend the HHS rule and keep our tax dollars out of the pockets of the abortion industry.

And we’re investigating the recent New York abortion law to expose who really pushed the legislation. We’ve just filed an administrative appeal in that case and are preparing a possible lawsuit over New York’s refusal to comply with our records demand about the barbaric abortion law. We’re also taking action in Virginia to stop that horrific infanticide bill from ever becoming law.

The ACLJ will not stop fighting until we put a stop to these barbaric new abortion laws, and completely defund and defeat the abortion industry. Countless defenseless unborn babies across the country need us.","Victory for Life in New Mexico After Surprising Turn-of-Events in State Senate, Striking Down Pro-Abortion Bill",Aclj.org,https://aclj.org/pro-life/victory-for-life-in-new-mexico-after-surprising-turn-of-events-in-state-senate-striking-down-pro-abortion-bill

In the short term, these programs will make it easier ...","The Liberal government has given us an election budget, but it’s hedged. Despite a “surprise” boost in government revenue, there aren’t many big ticket items compared to previous Liberal budgets. But there are big promises of big future programs—ideas to be fleshed out only after the next election. The risk here is that if the Liberals are not spending the money now and lose the election, a new government might use the increased fiscal breathing room for other priorities. Just ask the 2015 Martin government, whose pre-budget child care program was cancelled and rolled into the unhelpful Universal Child Care Benefit by the incoming Conservatives.

On the macro front, Budget 2019 announces another surprise revenue boost (since the fall economic update) of $6 billion this fiscal year (ending in 12 days) and $5 billion for each of next two years. Combine that with the $3 billion “risk adjustment” that is just subtracted from revenues and you’ve got some serious money available without changing the deficit figures at all. There was so much extra money that the gas tax transfer to cities got a $2.2 billion kick in the pants with the cheque going out the door before March 31, a short-term boon for city infrastructure. But with a deficit of only 1% of GDP (roughly $20 billion a year), the debt-to-GDP ratio is actually falling: the government could have spent roughly $10 billion more this year (ahem, the cost of a universal pharmacare program) and kept that ratio constant.

Housing affordability is a big issue for many young Canadians who have been on the losing end of 10%-per-year house price increases. The challenge is to balance their interests with those of existing homeowners who are enjoying (and relying on) the appreciating value of their homes. For the past decade, that was achieved by letting new home buyers rack up historically high mortgage debt. That particular approach has largely run its course, so the government is introducing two new types of debt millennials can access to buy a house: their RRSP savings, and a new no-interest loan/equity stake (home mortgage) offered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMCH).

In the short term, these programs will make it easier for people to afford homes, although at the cost of owing CMHC and having to pay back into personal RRSPs. The trouble is that access to these new types of debt, even if they are interest free, will likely further drive up house prices until, say, next year around this time. The affordability benefit is wiped out and we’re back to where we started.

There is no shortcut to housing affordability. But the government should be meeting millennials where they are, which is the rental market. There is plenty of money in previous budgets for affordable housing focused on low income households. These are laudable and important efforts, however, they won’t necessarily have a big impact on middle class renters. That group needs purpose-built rental apartment buildings, in other words—not condos—to reduce high rental costs while they wait out housing prices. Measures on that front were much less a focus in this budget.

Workplace training is another important issue addressed in Budget 2019. Employers often bemoan the “skills mismatch” that they say results in their not being able to find the employees they need. This is supposed to be the workers’ fault, even though recent generations of Canadians are the most educated in the industrialized world (and have the student debt to show for it). Despite historically low unemployment, these workers have also not seen raises anywhere near where they should be. A new Canada Training Credit in the 2019 budget will provide workers with $250 a year from the feds (which workers have to match) to get the training employers want. (Incidentally, average university tuition went up $220 last year.) This is combined with a four additional weeks of EI leave so workers can get training at EI expense and get off the company payroll.

While employers are vocal about the skills mismatch, they are completely missing in action when it comes to funding on-the-job training. These initiatives let them off the hook. Canadian employers spend far less on training than employers elsewhere. Forcing workers with high student debt to spend even more on training is just not fair. The government could have nationalized the Quebec approach of requiring employers who don’t spend enough on training to pay into a training fund.

The Liberal government has been hyping pharmacare since the fall. The Hoskins commission that was struck to investigate the issue released its interim report just a few weeks ago. It made three recommendations, two of which are in this budget: the creation of a national drug agency, and the creation of a national formulary. The budget also included a co-ordinating body for catastrophic drug coverage, something most provinces offer.

It’s hard to tell what this will mean in practice, since the Hoskins commission’s full report isn’t expected until June and the government will not commit to a detailed plan until then. This budget therefore does not take a position on the big issue of whether pharmacare will mean a fill-the-gaps approach within existing coverage or a public, first payer system that targets drug costs. The budget highlights a possible $3 billion in savings through lower drug costs (a federal first payer system would save roughly $6 billion), which recognizes how we pay some of the highest per capita drug costs in the world. The CCPA will comment on the Hoskins recommendations when we see them.

There were some changes to seniors programs. CPP for seniors over 70 will now be auto-enrolled. The government knows your age and whether you’re eligible for CPP; there’s no excuse for not paying it out simply because a person failed to fill out some paperwork. Auto-enrollment is an obvious and important measure to make sure seniors receive the benefits they deserve. Call centres for old age benefits will also be beefed up to acknowledge that seniors are less likely to have a computer and go online.

Finally, there is a change in how much employment earnings one can make before Guaranteed Income Supplement money is clawed back. What’s interesting about this measure is that it doesn’t include CPP income, which is how the 2019 Alternative Federal Budget would structure it. If you’re getting GIS as a senior, you’re by definition in poverty, so this measure supports working poor seniors. The reason why we targeted the CPP exemption was it would give a break to low income seniors who can’t work, not just those who can.

There are some interesting turns on the tax front in Budget 2019. For one, the much loathed (by progressives anyway) stock option deduction has been capped. This was suggested in the fall of 2017, but then apparently abandoned. Under the plan announced today, you can still get $200,000 worth of stock options run through the deduction, which seems an absurdly high cap for rich executives, but as one of the most unequal tax expenditures its closure is a step in the right direction. The trouble is, in the absence of other tax changes CEOs and other top executives will just shift how they are paid (to stock awards, for example), which is the danger of a one-off approach to tax expenditures instead of a comprehensive review.

OTTAWA — There was a teachable moment in the House of Commons Wednesday after Conservative MP Scott Reid accused the prime minister of sneaking a bagel under his desk.

Rules state members ""may refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.""

Reid, a longtime Tory MP, also called out the defence and heritage minister for the same violation.

Montreal Liberal MP Anthony Housefather chimed in on social media to share his disappointment that the snack Trudeau had snuck in was candy bar and not one of the city's wood-fired bagels.

The oddball moment happened in the first hour of a marathon voting session after the government defeated a Conservative motion asking the prime minister to waive any remaining solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality restrictions for former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

The Tories want Wilson-Raybould to return to the justice committee to continue her testimony and provide more details about a ""concerted and sustained effort"" she said she experienced from the Prime Minister's Office and other political staff to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The defeat of the motion gave way to voting on 257 separate motions which the Conservatives gave notice of last week. It's a procedural tactic the Opposition is using to protest the government's response to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Wilson-Raybould did not attend the Commons votes. Neither did former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott. Both former ministers quit Trudeau's cabinet last month, with Philpott citing lost confidence over the government's handling of the controversy.

Every one of the 257 motions oppose the latest supplementary and interim estimates. They're considered confidence votes because each motion deals with government funding for federal programs and initiatives. Losing one vote could trigger an election.

With the most at stake, Liberals set up cots outside the chamber in anticipation of the late-night voting session — which could take up to 40 hours.

Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen told reporters before the vote that the government could avoid the overnight session by siding with the Opposition and agreeing to let Wilson-Raybould return to committee with no restrictions on what she can say.

The Tories are accusing the government of using the annual budget, which was tabled Tuesday, as a distraction from allegations of political interference involving one of their former star ministers.

""We're not going to let them just kind of go about their business here, you know, business as usual, nothing to see with the scandal,"" Bergen said. She and her leader, Andrew Scheer, have promised ""to use every mechanism available"" to stop that from happening.

All of it was ...","The federal Liberals introduced the third budget of their government on Tuesday, with promises of new help for first-time homebuyers, seniors and digital news organizations.

All of it was announced without any plan for a balanced budget in the foreseeable future, even if the Liberals are re-elected.

The budget marked the last one that the Liberals will deliver before Canadians go to the polls on Oct. 21.

So now seems an appropriate time to look at what the Liberals have promised over their time in government — what they pledged when they were campaigning, what they said they would spend in their first budget, and see which ones they kept or didn’t manage to achieve over their time in office.

Here are some commitments that the Liberals made in the 2015 election campaign, their first budget in office, the most recent one, and how they’ve panned out for Canadians:

Deficit

Campaign: In its 2015 campaign platform, the Liberal Party envisioned a fiscal approach with two anchors: balancing the budget by 2019 and reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 27 per cent. They expected a “modest short-term deficit of less than $10 billion in each of the next two fiscal years — less than half the average [Stephen] Harper deficit of over $20 billion per year.”

Budget 2016: The deficit promise was pretty much abandoned out of the gate, with Budget 2016 unveiling a plan to remain in the red for the foreseeable future. Far from balancing the budget, the Liberals expected to run a deficit of $29.4 billion in 2016-17 , which would reduce to $29 billion in 2017-18, finally falling to $14.3 billion by 2020-21 — thoguh it’s not clear whether these figures include a contingency reserve. From 2016 through 2018, projected deficits were eventually expected to run well above the averages seen when Harper was prime minister — a time in which Canada was grappling with a global recession. By the time of this budget, the government had pledged to ensure that the “hard-fought gains attained in the 1990s and 2000s” were preserved. The new numbers — for deficit, too — were based in downward projections in a survey of private sector economists that was conducted in 2016, compared to another one that was conducted two years prior.

Budget 2019: The latest budget betrayed no expectation to put Canada back in the black. It showed a more modest deficit than was expected for 2017-18 — $14.9 billion vs. $29 billion — but estimates are higher for future fiscal years. While the 2016 budget projected that the deficit would hit $17.7 billion in 2019-20, now the Liberals expect it to hit $19.8 billion. There’s a similar story for the years 2020-21 — initially pegged at $14.3 billion, the deficit is now expected to hit $19.7 billion before falling to $9.8 billion in 2023-24. In other words, the Liberals expect to keep Canada in deficit right up to the end of their second term, if they win re-election.

Verdict: Unachieved, citing new economic projections.

Federal debt-to-GDP ratio

Campaign: The Liberals’ election platform cited federal debt-to-GDP ratio as the second of its two fiscal anchors, pledging to reduce it to 27 per cent. “In every year of our plan, federal debt-to-GDP will continue to fall,” it said.

Budget 2016: Like the deficit, this pledge was also essentially abandoned in the government’s first budget. The promise to reduce the ratio to 27 per cent became a projection that it would remain above 30 per cent for six years. The government noted, however, that Canada’s federal debt-to-GDP ratio remains the lowest among G7 countries.

Budget 2019: Like the deficit, the latest budget doesn’t foresee the debt-to-GDP ratio falling to 27 per cent in the foreseeable future. The ratio is expected to remain above 30 per cent up to 2022-23, when it’s projected to fall to 29.3 per cent and then 28.6 per cent the following year.

Verdict: Unachieved, citing new economic projections.

Canada Child Benefit

Campaign: The Liberals pitched a Canada Child Benefit (CCB) as a replacement for Stephen Harper’s Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB). The new benefit, tied to income, would provide a typical family of four with an extra $2,500 in tax-free help each year, and help to lift 315,000 Canadian children out of poverty, the platform said.

Budget 2016: The government’s first budget introduced the CCB, pledging to target it to low- and middle-income families that needed more help, while those with higher incomes would receive fewer benefits. The budget estimated that nine out of 10 families would receive more in child benefits than under the existing system. The CCB would leave about 300,000 fewer children in poverty in 2016-17 compared to 2014-15.

Budget 2019: The government cited the “income-boosting effects” of the CCB for helping to achieve a targeted 20 per cent reduction of poverty “three years ahead of time.” This included pulling 278,000 children out of poverty in 2017, as compared to 2015 — a statistic in line with the projection in the 2016 budget. Bloomberg noted that the CCB helped to drive poverty to “new lows,” with child poverty alone reaching its “lowest level in at least a decade.”

Verdict: Reports indicate that there are, indeed, fewer Canadians under 18 living in poverty following the introduction of the CCB.

Infrastructure

Campaign: The Liberals pledged a 10-year federal investment in infrastructure of $125 billion, up from $65 billion. This pledge included investing $20 billion more in public transit and $20 billion more in Canada’s “social infrastructure,” which refers to projects that help make communities “good places to live.”

2016 budget: The government’s first budget unveiled a plan to invest over $120 billion in infrastructure, in an effort to deliver “sustained economic growth for years to come.” This investment would “modernize and rehabilitate” public transit, as well as water and wastewater systems, help to protect infrastructure against the effects of climate change and provide affordable housing.

2019 budget: The government cited the approvals of over 33,000 infrastructure projects in various communities and said the “vast majority” are already underway. “More than $7 billion of the $19.9 billion committed to projects” within communities had been “fully invested” in infrastructure such as “new highways, bridges, buses, water treatment plants and community centres.” The latest budget now said the government was investing more than $180 billion over 12 years to “build infrastructure in communities across the country,” with additional investment expected to support as many as 42,000 jobs by 2020-21. However, the infrastructure program was criticized in a March 2018 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), which said that half the money set aside for its first phase hadn’t been linked to any project. The PBO found that, out of $14.4 billion that had been budgeted for Phase One, only $7.2 billion had been committed to a project. Further spending had been pushed to future years, the PBO noted. In December, Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said the government was overhauling how it approved funding for projects.

Verdict: A decade has not yet passed, but there are questions about how the infrastructure money is being spent.

Even the prime minister can get a little a peckish from time to time.

During the first hour of Wednesday night’s marathon voting session in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was called out by a member of the Conservatives for surreptitiously eating during the proceedings.

“We all know that the rules of this House do not permit us to eat in this place and I can’t help but observe that during the last vote a number of people were eating in their seats including the minister of defence, the minister of Canadian heritage, and the prime minister who appeared to be hiding a bagel in his desk,” Conservative MP Scott Reid announced.

As per the House’s Rules of Decorum, members are permitted to “refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.”

Reid gave one last parting shot at the prime minister when he stated: “Mr. Speaker, the prime minister has already stained this place with corruption, he does not need to stain it with mustard as well.”

The Conservative politician was referencing the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal that continues to dog the Liberals more than a month after it became public.

The SNC-Lavalin affair is also the reason why Members of Parliament were in the House of Commons on Wednesday night. The Liberal majority shot down a Conservative motion calling on the prime minister to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify again about the scandal.

This led to a Conservative-sponsored filibuster that has continued into Thursday morning.

In response to Reid’s accusation, Trudeau stood up and acknowledged he had eaten during the session.

“Indeed Mr. Speaker, I apologize. It was a chocolate bar and I apologize,” Trudeau stated as members of his party suppressed smiles behind him.",PM Trudeau apologizes for eating chocolate bar during voting marathon,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/pm-trudeau-apologizes-for-eating-chocolate-bar-during-voting-marathon-1.4345501

On Wednesday, Trudeau lost another prominent woman as Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced that she would leave the Liberal caucus and sit as an independent until she leaves Parliament come the election in October.

Caesar-Chavannes had previously announced that she would not run in the next election.

She also revealed that when she told Trudeau of her decision, citing the impact of politics on her family, that he yelled at her and claimed she wasn’t grateful enough for all his help.

“I no longer want to distract from the great work my caucus colleagues are doing,” Caesar-Chavannes said on Twitter.

She told CBC that she had become a distraction after her interview with the Globe and Mail where she revealed Trudeau’s harsh treatment.

“While I support the values and principles the Liberal Party that it might be good, since that message did go out, that I sit as an independent for the rest of the term,” she told CBC.

As Trudeau lost yet another woman — both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have resigned from cabinet and Caesar-Chavannes has resigned from caucus — the PM faced claims of being a fake feminist.

It was a claim Trudeau hit back against while speaking at a media event in Ottawa, saying he supports abortion while the Conservatives do not.

“People need to focus on the actions that we’ve taken as a government,” Trudeau said when asked about the fake feminist claim.

“And the contrast with the Conservatives who still can’t reconcile themselves to unequivocally defending a woman’s right to choose.”

So there you have it ladies, have all the abortions that you want, just don’t speak out or try to raise your voice.

That is Justin Trudeau’s brand of feminism.

“What I believe a feminist is, is somebody who treats women equally, believes that women have an equal voice at the table, should be treated equally in every way shape and form,” Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen told reporters after Question Period.

Bergen said that unlike Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer does treat women equally and fairly.

She also alluded to Trudeau’s oft-cited claim about men and women experiencing events differently.

“That would be Justin Trudeau’s explanation,” Bergen said.

“That seems to be his explanation every time a woman challenges him or every time a woman describes an experience with him that isn’t positive.”

Trudeau used the line that men and women can experience events differently to respond to groping allegations that resurfaced last summer, some 18 years after they were first made.

Both he and former top advisor Gerry Butts also used the same line to claim that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould simply didn’t understand what was happening when Trudeau and Butts pressured her to give a sweetheart deal to SNC-Lavalin to escape bribery and corruption charges.

Caesar-Chavannes wasn’t Trudeau’s only headache on Wednesday.

The PM has maintained that he only pressured the former attorney general to drop criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin to protect jobs yet the CEO of the company said in an interview that the PM is off the mark.

“There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They’ll get a job,” SNC CEO Neil Bruce said in an interview with Canadian Press.

“This thing that somehow they’re going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.”

Trudeau desperately wants this issue to go away but he keeps having his main messages proven false and key people in his party or his office resign.

The question everyone is asking is, who is next?

Philpott, once one of Trudeau’s most trusted and powerful cabinet ministers, resigned her post as president of the Treasury Board on March 4 citing the government’s handling of the SNC scandal.

Now, in an interview with Paul Wells of Macleans Magazine, Philpott says Canadians would like to hear the whole story.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system,” Philpott told Wells.

Philpott said her resignation was directly tied to the government’s handling of the SNC file, saying she could no longer keep cabinet solidarity with the PM and how he was portraying the issue.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history,” Philpott said.

The interview was published early Thursday as MPs continued voting in an all-night session.

The Conservatives had asked for former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear before the justice committee again and vowed to keep Parliament voting on more than 200 amendments if the Liberals continued to block her appearance.

Rather than allow Wilson-Raybould to speak, the Liberals opted for the all-night session, potentially costing millions of dollars.

When the story broke shortly after 6 a.m., MPs were still in the chamber voting and reading the article on their cellphones.

New Democrat MP Alistair MacGregor tweeted that he listened to Liberal MPs across the aisle attack Philpott, still a Liberal MP, as they read the story.

“Really sad to see them use words like ‘pathetic’ and ‘betrayal’ to describe her. It’s like the Liberals have total blinders on to principled actions,” MacGregor tweeted.

The bombshell from Philpott comes a day after Trudeau’s government was rocked with another resignation, this one not from cabinet but from caucus.

Whitby MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced on Wednesday that she was leaving the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent. Caesar-Chavannes had previously said she would not run in the next election but recently let slip how Trudeau reacted when she informed him of her decision.

She says yelling, hostility and guilt where all tactics used by Trudeau, who claimed Caesar-Chavannes didn’t appreciate all that he had done for her. After Trudeau’s office denied any yelling, Caesar-Chavannes’s husband came forward to say that he was in the room during the phone call and could hear Trudeau yelling through the phone.

None of this helps Trudeau with his self-styled feminist image, he’s silencing women and firing or yelling at them when they don’t do his bidding.

The Conservatives have started calling Trudeau a fake feminist, a charge the PM has responded to by saying he supports abortions.

That may be true but he doesn’t support women speaking their mind or acting independently or on principle.

After Philpott’s interview and her revelations, the call has to be made again to let these women speak and speak freely.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada’s 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau’s embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government’s chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau’s Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday’s budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

“It’s just too broad,” said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. “They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.”

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was “a political rather than an economic decision,” he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied “that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.”

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau’s resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould’s statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals’ best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau’s budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.","Canada's Trudeau under pressure as MP quits, budget criticized",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R12Z6-OCATP

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans’ magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to “share completely” her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott’s remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau’s closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

“Until we are able to put this behind us, it’s pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,” Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: “No, we never gave a number.”

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company’s share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

Trudeau responded to Reid’s claim and acknowledged he had, in fact, been eating during the session.

Members of his party tried not to laugh as he addressed the situation and you can’t blame them for wanting to. It’s kind of hilarious to think of our country’s leader sneaking chocolate into the House of Commons.

Unfortunately for Trudeau, the House of Commons doesn’t permit food or eating. In fact, the Decorum states that members are permitted to “refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.”

The session - which had the potential to last a whopping 40 hours - led some Liberal party members to actually set up cots outside the chamber in preparation.

Reid announced to the room, ""We all know that the rules of this House do not permit us to eat in this place and I can’t help but observe that during the last vote a number of people were eating in their seats including the minister of defense, the minister of Canadian heritage, and the prime minister who appeared to be hiding a bagel in his desk.""

According to the House’s Rules of Decorum, members are allowed to ""refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.""

Reid rubbed some extra salt in Trudeau's wound when he stated, ""Mr. Speaker, the prime minister has already stained this place with corruption, he does not need to stain it with mustard as well.""

Of course, Reid was making a point to reference the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal that continues to cast a shadow on Trudeau's Liberal government even a month after the case had surfaced to the public.

The SNC-Lavalin case was, in fact, responsible for Members of Parliament gathering in the House of Commons on Wednesday night. The Liberal majority rejected a Conservative motion which directed Trudeau to permit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify about the scandal once again.

Trudeau wasn't afraid to address the accusation. But not before correcting Reid first.

OTTAWA – Once again this year, Justin Trudeau ignored the needs of Quebecers with the federal budget. The people of Quebec deserve a government in Ottawa that will do its part to help build a better future.

""100,000 young Quebecers were on the street last week asking Justin Trudeau's Liberals to take a bold step forward to fight climate change,"" said NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. “Yet there is nothing in the budget that responds to their cries to protect the planet. The new investments announced are very meek compared to what the Liberals are investing in fossil fuels. This is wrong.”

The Government of Quebec has asked for an increase in the health care transfers cut by the Liberals, but there is nothing in the budget to help Quebec provide better health care. Quebec also announced that it will ask Netflix and other web giants to pay their fair share, but Justin Trudeau abandoned them once again.

""We all know that Quebecers are paying a lot of money to compensate for tax havens and tax loopholes, and yesterday's budget does nothing to recover the $16 billion a year it costs us,"" added Deputy Leader Alexandre Boulerice. “Quebecers are tired of half measures, and they deserve a government that truly understands its distinctiveness and is willing to do its part to allow Quebecers to build a better future.”

Several organizations called for the establishment of public and universal drug coverage, but there is nothing in the budget that will ensure that Quebecers pay less for their drugs. The Liberal government also announced the same amount as the Conservatives for compensation for dairy producers. The NDP’s Quebec caucus believes this situation is wrong.

At an afternoon stop outside a housing development in Ottawa’s eastern suburbs, touting the measures in the new federal budget to make homes more affordable, Trudeau gave what sounded much like a stump speech, talking about “historic investments” in Canadians — getting there after dismissing Conservatives’ complaints that the Liberals should have to answer more for the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“What eats away at the Conservatives the most is that our approach is working,” he said. “Over the past three years, 900,000 Canadians created new jobs. Over the past three years, we’ve seen the lowest employment in 40 years. And we’ve see 825,000 Canadians, including 300,000 kids, lifted out of poverty because of measures this government is taking. And in this budget we just put forward yesterday, from easier access to home-ownership, to support for students, to money directly for seniors, to investments in broadband and high-speed internet access right across the country, we are responding to the priorities that Canadians have. The Conservatives have no plan for the economy, that’s why they want to talk about anything else. We are going to stay focused on delivering for Canadians, as we are today.”

While Trudeau emphasizes what all the government spending has done, the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer say it’s a spree funded by borrowing against the future.

Scheer had given a public speech to his caucus members in Ottawa earlier in the day, portraying Trudeau’s Liberals as a big-spending government with nothing but disdain for the idea of balanced budgets.

During the 2015 campaign, Trudeau warned that a Liberal government would initially run modest deficits, but would balance the books by 2019. That promise went out the window Tuesday with a budget that projects of 2019-20 deficit of $19.8 billion.

“During the televised leaders’ debate, he said this: ’I am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way we always have… We will balance the budget in 2019,’ ” Scheer said to the laughter of his colleagues. “Canadians who don’t have family fortunes like him know … that you can’t borrow your way out of debt and you can’t make other people pay for your mistakes.”

Trudeau acknowledged that his government has been borrowing heavily but he emphasized that although the national debt keeps growing, the economy is growing at about the same rate, so the burden isn’t getting harder to bear.

“Canadians need to know that our projections are sustainable,” he said,

Finance Minister Bill Morneau made his own post-budget sales effort Wednesday, defending the Liberal strategy of investing in consumer confidence in two separate appearances.

The budget Morneau tabled Tuesday in the House of Commons showcased several measures aimed at helping more would-be homebuyers get into the housing market for the first time; that’s what he focused on in a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

Under the new measures, the government is proposing to pick up five per cent of a mortgage on the purchase of an existing home for households that earn under $120,000 and have been approved for a mortgage no more than four times their income — or 10 per cent, if the house is new, in an attempt to spur construction. The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take up to $35,000 from their tax-free retirement savings accounts to spend on homes.

But Morneau insisted the government has also taken prudent steps to ensure that additional demand in markets like Toronto and Vancouver won’t result in higher prices.

“When we think about the overall homebuyer market, we have roughly half a million home purchases a year, but 100,000 of them are first-time homebuyers,” Morneau told a news conference after a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

“We’re talking about (adding) 20, maybe 30, maybe 40,000 new families, which is really important to those families, but we’ve done the modelling to show (it’s) not an issue around changing demand dynamics.”

In particular, Morneau picked out three other measures in the budget that he said are aimed at preventing a spike in home prices: A Canada Revenue Agency crackdown on real-estate money-laundering, $10 billion in affordable rental construction financing and a $300-million contest of sorts to challenge municipalities to come up with creative solutions to adding housing stock.

In an afternoon appearance back in downtown Ottawa, at just the same time as Trudeau’s, Morneau focused on a program to help workers pay for skills training while keeping their jobs.

“We’re always going to try and encourage Canadians to invest in their own success. Like we’ve put forward in this budget, we’re hoping that people will continue to improve their skills so that they can do better in their current jobs and do better for themselves and their families,” he said. “I’m always going to hope that we can have a higher level of growth. I think that the only way we can do that is by recognizing that what the tools are at our disposal are people. So, if we have highly educated, highly trained people, we’re going to do better.”

And then he echoed Trudeau on how content the Liberals will be to fight the election on their record of borrowing and spending.

“I think what will be happening in the election campaign is Canadians look at what we’ve done over the last four years,” Morneau said. “We made promises that we would invest in Canadians. What they can see is we followed through on those promises.”","Trudeau, Morneau begin work of selling big-spending Liberal budget to voters",O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/politics/finance-minister-defends-liberal-budget-measures-as-sales-effort-gets-underway/wcm/34a8aaf2-d534-4f6a-8191-cd95e178e8ee

In an explosive interview with Maclean's — her first media interview since she resigned from the Liberal cabinet on Mar. 4 — Philpott said there is ""much more"" to the SNC-Lavalin affair and Canadians have concerns about the government's attempts to ""shut down"" the story.

Philpott pointed to Commons justice committee testimony by Gerry Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary, in which Butts referenced a Jan. 6 meeting she had with Trudeau about the company's efforts to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that would allow it to avoid a trial on bribery charges.

""I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public knew about it. Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?"" she told Maclean's.

Trudeau was asked about that meeting during a news conference in Mississauga, Ont. Thursday morning. He said the discussion was about appointing Philpott as Treasury Board president and moving Wilson-Raybould to fill her role as Indigenous Services minister. The prime minister said Philpott asked if Wilson-Raybould's shuffle from the justice minister and attorney general's role was in relation to the SNC-Lavalin issue.

""I told her no, it was not,"" Trudeau said.

At that point, Trudeau said, they talked about how Philpott could assist Wilson-Raybould in her new role.

""It was a good and positive conversation,"" he said.

PM Justin Trudeau describes his January 6th meeting with former member of cabinet Jane Philpott as a 'good and positive conversation'. 1:07

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking a DPA that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Despite tensions in the Liberal caucus over Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remaining in the fold, Trudeau said again today that both MPs remain supportive of the Liberal agenda.

Parliamentary uproar

The Maclean's interview was published in the midst of a parliamentary uproar over the Liberals' move to shut down the Commons justice committee's probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Philpott said believes Canadians need answers to maintain their confidence in the independence of the justice system.

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,"" she told journalist Paul Wells. ""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.""

The House of Commons is currently engaged in a marathon voting session — a parliamentary tactic deployed by the Conservatives to protest the Liberals shutting down the committee investigation before former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould could be recalled to testify for a second time.

During the interview with Maclean's, Phlipott said Wilson-Raybould may not have resigned as justice minister and attorney general as she was enduring inappropriate pressure to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution because she ""had her finger in the dike."" She may have felt that her resignation could put the independence of the justice system at risk, Philpott said.

""Another answer to that is, from the perspective of somebody who is under pressure and perhaps being harassed, it's incredibly hard – if you talk to people who are harassed in any capacity, to maintain relationships and to find the right time to be able to speak up about the fact that you are being treated that way,"" Philpott said.

""So you know, I think if you look at examples of other types of bullying or harassment, it's not necessarily as easy as people might think to speak to those who are inflicting it upon you.""

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said she's angry that the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a so-called gag order on Liberal MP Jane Philpott over the SNC-Lavalin controversy. 1:03

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said the Maclean's interview points to a ""culture of intimidation"" within the Trudeau government. She accused Trudeau of imposing a ""gag order"" on Philpott and Wilson-Raybould in an attempt to contain the SNC-Lavalin story.

""How can we be serious about making Parliament Hill a place for women to work if these are the sorts of stories that Canadians see coming out, if no action is taken?"" she asked.

Trudeau called 'fake feminist'

Conservatives labelled Trudeau a ""fake feminist"" for blocking the former ministers from fully telling their story. Trudeau waived cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould, but only for her time as attorney general and justice minister.

The waiver does not cover the period after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs and her subsequent resignation from cabinet.

Rempel said blocking both women from speaking fully shows a gender issue is at play.

""Any Canadian woman, regardless of stripe, should be outraged by what is happening to these women,"" she said. ""It's disgusting.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the Philpott interview is more evidence of a ""serious problem"" that merits a full public airing.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian cabinet minister, who had quit in protest over the government's handling of a corruption scandal, said she and others had more to say about the matter, indicating more pain to come for embattled Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

""There's much more to the story that should be told,"" former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans' magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,"" she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to ""share completely"" her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott's remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau's closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

""Until we are able to put this behind us, it's pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,"" Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: ""No, we never gave a number.""

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company's share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin's headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

In protest, the Conservatives forced the House to sit through the night from Wednesday into Thursday casting votes on hundreds of confidence motions.

The only way to avoid this, writes the columnist, is for Justin Trudeau to“check his ego at the door.” In addition to dropping his ego, Trudeau was also advised to own up and concede that he and his allies messed up and won’t interfere with criminal prosecutions again.

Trudeau ego was likened to that of Wynne who lost all touch with the people and believed she could beat all odds all by herself until Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives came along with a simple three-word slogan: “For the People.” And took the leadership seat away from her.

It took Wynne about a decade to lose the Ontario seat, but it’s taking Trudeau just about three years, and worse still he seems to be in a free-fall just seven months before the elections. At present, a lot of Canadians are disappointed with Trudeau’s recent actions and the actions of his party allies such as PCO head Michael Wernick, especially how they have handled the entire SNC Lavalin scandal, now popularly called LavScam.

""The past few weeks have been an abysmal, slow-motion train wreck in issues management for the Trudeau Government,"" Ottawa-based political analyst YaroslavBaransaid, speaking with CNN.

When he was elected, Trudeau had promised to bring Canada back, but his actions these past few weeks could only be taking Canada backwards, right now Canada is under investigations by The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. They are reviewing the country’s compliance with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. “That’s the kind of review you’d expect of developing countries rife with corruption.” Says Marin. “Interestingly, Trudeau and his bunch of gofers justified harassing Wilson-Raybould into a deferred prosecution agreement by claiming they could save 9,000 jobs. But a country is under an OECD bribery investigation sends bad vibes to international businesses who might want to invest in Canada. Brilliant.”

Worse still, in the face of all this, Trudeau remains unrepentant. He is neither contrite nor apologetic and blames the former attorney general, Wilson-Raybould for not coming to him with her protests. Even after she had given evidence, that she did meet him with her objections.

Recently, Trudeau seems to be busy with any other thing but the issue at hand. Last week, on Wednesday 13th of March when the Justice Committee was to hold an emergency meeting to discuss bringing back Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance. Trudeau’s Liberals used their majority to adjourn the committee’s work to budget day, it is apparent, that they hope that the budget’s news would swallow upLavscam. Trudeau has also been vacationing, going from North Captiva Island to Florida while the image of its government gets even more tainted.

This begs questions about the Prime Minister’s commitment to the core values that got him that federal seat in the first place.If Trudeau keeps this up, Conservative Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer might just be having a smooth ride in the forthcoming elections.","Failure Looms: Trudeau’s Lav-Scam Snowballs, as Federal Elections Approach",Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13605-failure-looms-trudeaus-lav-scam-snowballs-as-federal-elections-approach.html

It’s possible to imagine a government that would advertise that change as part of a society-wide shift in attitudes ...","Here and there you still find glimpses of an activist and imaginative government. I’ll get to the big numbers, but I was struck, and encouraged, by a smaller one. On page 156 of Bill Morneau’s 460-page 2019 federal budget there’s $30.5 million over five years for expanded access to safe prescription opioids, “protecting people with problematic opioid use from the risks of overdose and death.”

This is legalization of hard drugs by another name, since many of the people who need a safe opioid supply to survive the greatest public-health crisis of our time will now have an easier time getting that supply. Prohibition remains in place, but Justin Trudeau’s Liberals government is building life-saving bypasses around the general policy.

It’s possible to imagine a government that would advertise that change as part of a society-wide shift in attitudes towards addiction and harm reduction, but the policy is more important than the communications strategy, and at least the policy is here.

Like so many such gestures in Budget 2019, it’s also strikingly modest in scope, starting with $1 million in 2019-2020 and ramping up. This is not a lot compared to the $150 million emergency opioid fund of Budget 2018, or the $350 million in total new investment on the file since this plague started slaughtering drug users in 2017.

The sum of a government’s effort, of course, is measured across its term in office, not only in its election-year announcements. Also of course, if Trudeau and Morneau could afford to announce more new stuff they’d do it. They’ve spent just about every dime of the fiscal windfall they won from lower-than-predicted deficits. But in large measure they’re kept from making big marquee announcements by all the big marquee announcements of earlier years.

Note that the opioid money I led with is $30.5 million over 5 years. Or $6-ish million a year. That’s a heartening announcement now, but it’ll be progressively reduced margin of manoeuvre for next year’s finance minister, whoever that will be. Trudeau/Morneau’s enthusiastic embrace of multi-year spending ramp-ups is now, four budgets in, seriously cramping Morneau/Trudeau’s style.

And it continues: $37.4 million over five years for expanded parental leave for PhD and postdoctoral researchers. A $327.5 million support program over 5 years for First Nations postsecondary students. A comparable program for Inuit students at $125.5 million over 10 years. (Why is the Inuit program twice as long as the First Nations program? It’s a mystery.) $315 over five years to “make the Canada Service Corps Canada’s signature national youth service program.” It’s traditional in French-language news outlets to call such wide-angle disbursement of moderate sums “saupoudrage,” or sprinkling. This is a very sprinkly budget.

Some of its provisions are more ambitious. There’s a billion (over only two years) to improve access to exorbitantly expensive drugs for specified rare diseases. (How do TruMorn afford that? By spending the money later: it will begin flowing only in 2022-23.) There’s $224 million right out of the gate, rising to $392 million in five years, to make Canada Student Loans more generous. There’s $2.2 billion, refreshingly free of attached strings, in “much needed infrastructure funds” right now, this year.

Why infrastructure funds would still be “much needed,” four years into the tenure of the third prime minister in a row to make infrastructure spending a personal priority, is an interesting question for another day.

But overall, the impression is of a government that is deeply preoccupied with election-year concerns but can’t shake loose much money to pay for election-year goodies. As a result, MorTru are forced to come up with novel funding for some of their promises. Universal high-speed internet access will be paid, in part, by “new investments by the Canada Infrastructure Bank.”

You remember the Canada Infrastructure Bank. It was the arms-length agency that was designed to attract countless hundreds of billions from Norwegian and Emirati pension funds to pay for game-changing new public infrastructure. Monorails. Spaceports. Now we learn that the Bank is “examining opportunities… to seek to invest $1 billion over the next 10 years and leverage at least $2 billion in additional private sector investment” to pay for this broadband.

How the government knows this, when the Bank has made no public announcement, and how we are to keep calling the bank arms-length when TruMor are clearly manipulating it with their teeny T Rex arms, is another interesting pair of questions for another interesting day.

Perhaps I can be forgiven for being particularly interested in the questions that arose as I read the section on Supporting Canadian Journalism. This is four paragraphs on Page 173 and four more illuminating pages at the very back of the book. In the jargon of my craft, MorTru are burying the lede.

“A strong and independent news media is crucial to a well-functioning democracy,” they write, so they’re giving the news media hundreds of millions of dollars. Never let it be said that irony is dead. The Prime Minister and his finance minister promise “an independent panel of experts” to “recommend… eligibility criteria.” But the eligibility criteria are already laid out in detail in pages 373-376. I’m left wondering what the independent panel is for.

In order to get its share of the federal money, a news organization will need “Qualified Canadian Journalism Organization” status. It’ll need to be incorporated in Canada, operate in Canada, resident in Canada, its chairperson and at least 75 per cent of its directors will have to be Canadian.

It “must not be primarily focused on a particular topic such as industry-specific news, sports, recreation, arts, lifestyle or entertainment.” You’ll be pleased to know your government wants to subsidize nothing but political news. Because that’s not problematic.

To “ensure that registered journalism organizations are not used to promote the views or objectives of any particular person or related group of persons,” a registered organization “must not be factually controlled by a person (or group of persons).” One suspects this line is designed to keep the kitty out of the hands of anyone named Ezra. Its effect on organizations run by people named Jesse, or founded by people named Joe Atkinson, remains a subject for another day.

Somebody has already decided eligible newsroom labour costs will be capped at $55,000 per year; that the tax credits will be available from next January, i.e. for donations this year; that magazines receiving money from the Canada Periodical Fund, such as the one you’re holding in your digital hands, will not qualify for the labour tax credit; that “carrying on a broadcasting undertaking”—Periscope? Twitter Live?—will also be disqualifying; and, again, that the wage subsidy kicks in this year.

My understanding is that the Conservative opposition intends to spend not a dime of the money the Liberals have put aside for this massive subsidy to Canadian political journalism. Which means that some large percentage of the reporters covering this autumn’s federal election campaign will be in a direct conflict of interest. Maybe this won’t affect anyone’s coverage! Maybe it will backfire, and cranky reporters will go extra-hard on the hand that has already budgeted their feeding! But objectively, one of the issues in the next election will be the taxes on the salaries of reporters who are already working this year. I’m sure this won’t be a problem at all. And you believe me, right?

On days like today, I wish that all federal politicians were required to undergo brain scans, which would be publicly released.

It's because the political crisis that's affecting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shows no signs of going away. And perhaps some brain scans would help clear the air once and for all.

I'll have more on that later in this article.

But here's the central question facing Canadians.

Is Trudeau a con artist—or, as Macleans suggested, an ""imposter""? Or did he genuinely believe he was acting in the public interest when he claimed that 9,000 jobs were in jeopardy if SNC-Lavalin didn't obtain a deferred prosecution agreement?

Here's what we know now.

Yesterday, SNC-Lavalin's CEO, Neil Bruce, rejected Liberal suggestions that 9,000 jobs could vanish without a DPA.

Bruce told Radio-Canada that many of his company's Canadian employees would be snapped up by other engineering and construction companies.

That was also pointed out on this website last month by B.C. resident Phil Le Good. He keeps a close eye on the construction and engineering sector.

Yet the 9,000-jobs line was repeatedly peddled in the media.

The next bombshell on this story came from a former senior cabinet minister, Jane Philpott.

She told Macleans magazine that there's more to the SNC-Lavalin story than has been revealed to date.

She's particularly troubled by the government's insistence on muzzling former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau's cabinet has refused to waive cabinet confidentiality after January 14 so Wilson-Raybould can tell more of her story to the Commons justice committee.

""If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories?"" Philpott declared to journalist Paul Wells.

Moreover, Philpott said it was an ""insult"" for Finance Minister Bill Morneau to suggest that she quit cabinet as an expression of personal friendship with Wilson-Raybould.

So there you have it: two of the most powerful women in Trudeau's cabinet—one a medical doctor, the other a former prosecutor—have walked out on him.

A third, Celina R. Caesar-Chavannes, has quit the Liberal caucus.

What are their conclusions about Trudeau that the public might not be aware of?

Neuroscience can expose con artists

Now, on to those brain scans.

Last year, the journal Human Brain Mapping published a paper examining ""the neural correlates associated with psychopathy"".

This was done with the help of resting-state functional magnetic resource imaging.

University of New Mexico researcher Kent Kiehl brought a mobile device into a medium-security prison and screened inmates who had previously been diagnosed with psychopathy.

Another member of the research team was University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health assistant psychiatry professor Michael Koenigs.

He said it was the first study to reveal structural and functional differences in the brains of people who had been assessed as psychopaths.

The scans showed reduced connections between the part of the brain associated with empathy and guilt and the part of the brain that mediates fear and anxiety.

Specifically, the research indicated that Factor 1 traits for psychopathy—generally covering selfish, callous, and remorseless use of others—are associated with structural anomalies in the brain.

Factor 1 traits include the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy, such as shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, and lack of empathy.

These traits are also linked to narcissistic personality disorder, which is characterized by grandiosity and a lack of empathy.

People who score highly in these Factor 1 traits demonstrate low levels of distress, suffer little stress, and have a low suicide rate.

""Factor 1 scores showed both increased and reduced functional connectivity between RSNs [resting-state networks] from seven brain domains (sensorimotor, cerebellar, visual, salience, default mode, executive control, and attentional),"" the researchers stated in the abstract. ""Consistent with hypotheses, RSNs from the paralimbic system-insula, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, orbital frontal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus-were related to Factor 1 scores.""

Factor 2 traits of psychopathy relate to social deviance and sensation seeking. The study could not detect functional network connectivity issues for these characteristics through magnetic-resonance imaging.

To sum up:

* portable functional magnetic resonance imaging machines can detect shortcomings in neural connections;

* some people with character defects demonstrate anomalies in the links between the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with empathy and guilt, and the amygdala;

* the amygdala is an almond-shaped set of neurons in the brain's limbic system that's associated with fear.

It's reasonable to conclude that people with these particular anomalies are likely to be less trustworthy than the average person. At the very least, they're likely to have less empathy.

Isn't that something Canadians deserve to know the next time they walk into the ballot box?

It raises a legitimate question whether anyone entering federal politics should have to undergo this screening.

If we're allowed to have access to their financial-disclosure statements, why not their brain scans?

By Julie Gordon

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, seeking to move past a political crisis threatening its re-election, lavished new spending on middle-class voters in its budget on Tuesday, but the measures may be spread too thin to move the needle before October's vote.

The budget was aimed at boosting consumer spending at a time when the economy is slowing, while shifting the narrative away from a scandal involving a major engineering and construction company that has shaken the ruling Liberal Party government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top government officials leaned on his former justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

The issue has dragged the party down in opinion polls, which indicate it is at risk of losing power to the official opposition Conservatives in October's federal election.

The Liberals looked to counter that narrative with a budget that sprinkled benefits widely, helping everyone from millennials to retirees.

But with no single blockbuster pledge and with opposition antics distracting from the Liberals' message, Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos said the budget was unlikely to put Trudeau's party back ahead.

""At best, they can hope to stop the political bleeding,"" he said. The Liberals fell to 32.6 percent support in the latest Nanos Research poll, behind the Conservatives at 35.5 percent.

Opposition lawmakers delayed Finance Minister Bill Morneau from presenting the budget for an hour and then the Conservatives drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers. They later walked out in protest at what party leader Andrew Scheer said was Trudeau's attempt to bury the SNC-Lavalin scandal, calling it a ""corruption cover-up.""

""This budget has no legitimacy and we could not legitimize it by remaining in the chamber,"" Scheer told reporters.

The budget outlined C$21 billion ($15.8 billion) in spending over five years on new measures, including help to get first-time buyers into housing, a new skills training benefit, new perks for retirees and students, and the creation of a federal agency to cut the cost of prescription medications.

""The challenge I think with this budget is that there are so many boxes they tried to tick - everybody will get a little bit, but nobody will get enough,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.

""To me, you get more bang for your buck if you have a focused approach,"" he added.

HELP FOR HOMEBUYERS

With many Canadians struggling to buy homes amid rising interest rates and stricter mortgage rules, the budget promised measures to help millennials and others boost their purchasing power without taking on too much debt.

It introduced a program to let some first-time buyers finance a portion of their home purchases through a shared equity mortgage with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government housing agency.

Under the plan, the CMHC would provide 10 percent equity on a new home or 5 percent on a resale home. It would then share in any upside benefit or downside risk, and the government said the move would incentivize the construction of new housing supply.

The move, along with other housing incentives, could give Canada's housing market a much-needed shot in the arm, reviving construction and bolstering homeowner sentiment, although economists warned the overall impact may be marginal.

""It is a potential concession that they went a step too far in dampening the housing market,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

BUSINESSES LEFT OUT

But there was little in the budget for corporate Canada, despite repeated calls from business groups for wide-ranging tax changes or cuts to boost competitiveness.

In his November budget update, Morneau unveiled a plan to allow businesses to write off additional capital investments to help them compete globally, but he stopped short of slashing taxes, saying it would cost tens of billions.

The budget on Tuesday did include a new training benefit, which will give workers money toward tuition and paid time off work to pursue new skills.

The measure could help employers that say they are struggling to fill jobs requiring specialized skills, notably in the technology and healthcare fields.

Trudeau is scheduled on Friday to hold a town hall meeting with Thunder-Bay Superior North MP Patty Hajdu and Thunder Bay-Rainy River MP Don Rusnak at the CJ Sanders Fieldhouse on Lakehead University campus , according to an event posting on Hajdu's parliamentary website.

According to the event posting, doors will open starting at 5 p.m., with the 90-minute event beginning at 7 p.m.

The prime minister most recently visited Thunder Bay in April 2016, where he made an announcement about federal funding for mass-transit projects across the country.

The visit comes days after Rusnak announced he won't be seeking a second term in the House of Commons, despite being nominated Last November as the riding's Liberal candidate.

Later this evening, he’ll celebrate Nowruz — which marks Persian New Year —in Concord, with Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef also expected to be in the crowd for the community festivities.

Back in the capital, the aforementioned vote-a-thon — which, as previewed by iPolitics’ own Process Nerd yesterday, was triggered by the Conservatives to protest Trudeau’s refusal to waive all remaining privilege constraints on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, which, they contend, is preventing her from going public with the full story behind her departure from cabinet last month — is expected to continue until at least 10 AM.

Under House rules, that would automatically pre-empt Thursday’s scheduled House sitting, even if the vote wrapped up within the next few minutes, but if the Conservatives are committed to forcing a recorded division on each and every one of the more than 250 motions currently in the queue, it could carry on until Friday morning.

In any case, while the Liberals are required to keep a working majority in the Chamber at all times — these are, after all, technically confidence votes, which means even one defeat could theoretically bring down the government — at least a few front benchers have been allowed to skip House duty.

One of the ministers set to headline an out-of-precinct event is Finance Minister Bill Morneau himself, who is booked in for an afternoon session at the University of New Brunswick, where, as per the advisory, he’ll outline how his latest budget will help young people “find and keep good jobs,” as well as provide “more opportunities for … accessible and affordable education” and “help to find an affordable place to call home.”

Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos will deliver a similar message in Victoria, where’’ he will “highlight” new budget measures at a city-organized event.

Meanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne meets with “community leaders” in Montreal, while back in the capital, Official Languages and Tourism Minister Melanie Joly drops by the Sport Events Congress to emphasize the “importance of sport tourism,” as well as the “upcoming federal tourism strategy.”

Since this is an election year, the Trudeau Liberal deficit ...","Guess what was supposed to happen in 2019? Aside from this being an election

year, no more federal budget deficits. At least that was the pledge Justin

Trudeau made when he campaigned for his dad’s old job in Ottawa back in

2015. Since this is an election year, the Trudeau Liberal deficit addiction bears

some scrutiny.

Last time around, he laid out a platform that promised deficits of no more than

$10 billion a year for the first three years and we’d be deficit-free by this year. All

that planned spending during a period of non-economic turmoil was supposed

to bolster Canada’s so-called crumbling infrastructure and presumably cover

Liberal policy commitments.

Well didn’t Justin and his pals blow by that $10 billion in the first eight months,

clocking in at $12.7 billion. That compares to a $1 billion surplus under the previous

regime the year before. And they have been busting through that ceiling every

year since, abandoning any pretext of eliminating budget deficits. More than $75

billion has been added to the federal debt, compared to the $20 billion based on

the Liberal’s election plan.

Most folks have credit cards. If we spend on credit, we are required to make a

minimum payment and cover hefty interest charges.

Governments have to pay interest too, although not nearly as much as we do on

our credit card balances. But it’s okay for them because of a rationalization called

the debt to GDP ratio. That means the debt can pile up as long as the spender

continues to pay interest without refinancing or harming the economy. And it can

be pushed ahead for an eternity.

Not to worry, Trudeau says. The economy is humming, unemployment is low

and business profits are up. Besides, finance minister Bill Morneau contends

deficits and debts aren’t all that important.

Former Prime Minister Paul Martin supports the Trudeau government’s proclivity

for deficits, being a good Liberal and this an election year. He is also aware of

the danger presented by endless deficits and mounting debt.

In 1993, as finance minister, he faced a yearly deficit of $42 billion after successive

governments piled up red ink over the previous 25 years, starting with

Trudeau senior. It was alarming enough for the government to slash $25 billion

from the federal budget in three years and post five budget surpluses, which

allowed the government to ramp up its spending. Laser focus on the debt to GDP

ratio, of course.

But what happens if the economy goes south because of a recession? Or, for

example, an unexpected Trump eruption results in the US scuttling the NAFTA

redo? What if interest rates are hiked? Growing interest payments will impact

productive spending.

Here are some numbers to consider. Canada’s net debt as of 2017-18 was $758.8

billion with a $26 billion interest charge.

A finance department report shows federal deficits until 2040-41. The debt

will be almost erased by 2050, as the ratio drops from 28.5% in 2023-24 to 24% in

2055-56. But this dubious scenario presumes surpluses in the 2040s and 2050s go

directly to reducing the debt. It’s dubious because governments in the past (and

current) always found reasons to put off debt reduction.

By contrast, the 2014 version of the financial report under the Stephen Harper

regime projected decades of consecutive surpluses (perhaps equally dubious).

The Trudeau government wasn’t elected in 2015 on a platform that included

deficits and debt as far as the eye can see. Someone, please, revoke that credit

card. This is short-term gain for long-term pain that saddles future generations

with the risk and the fallout.","Trudeau’s deficits: Short-term gain, long-term pain",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/insights/trudeaus-deficits-short-term-gain-long-term-pain/

Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie is praising the 2019 federal budget as a boon to municipalities—including Mississauga.

In a recent statement, Crombie said the budget that was recently released by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will ensure that ""tens of millions"" flow to Mississauga.

""Today, the federal government reaffirmed the important role that cities play in powering the nation by making several strategic, long-term investments in our growth. This year's budget signals a modernization in our relationship with the federal government by putting tools and funding directly in the hands of cities like Mississauga,"" Crombie said in a statement.

""Many of the investments will flow directly to us, ensuring that we are able to access funding quickly to deliver results for residents while addressing our city-building priorities.""

Crombie said she's pleased to see investments in a number of specific areas that are critical to building a “21st Century city.”

The federal government has committed to a one-time, doubling of the gas tax fund to $2.2 billion.

According to Crombie, funding will be directly transferred to cities—something she had been calling for, along with other Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) members, for some time.

""This is an important change and one of the largest fund transfers from the federal government to municipalities. This top-up will help us build strong cities and spur economic growth by helping cities address infrastructure deficits and plan for future transit and roads,"" Crombie said.

Crombie has also praised the federal government's plans to help prospective homeowners purchase their first house.

Through the First Time Home Buyers Incentive, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) will invest up to the $1.25 billion over three years to, ideally, make it easier for first time home-buyers to get in the market. It will also include increasing the RRSP withdrawal limit from $25,000 to $35,000.

Crombie says this initiative will help Mississauga further activate it Making Room for the Middle Affordable Housing Strategy—a city-owned strategy that includes incentivizing developers to include affordable units in future builds, protecting the city's existing rental stock and regulating secondary units (better known as basement apartments).

Crombie also praised the the Green Municipal Fund (GMF), a fund through which cities will be able to access $1 billion in funding directly through FCM to help improve energy efficiency in residential, commercial and municipal properties.

Three streams of funding can be accessed to help retrofit and improve energy conservation of community buildings ($300M), provide financing for residents to undertake home energy retrofits ($300M), support affordable housing development ($350M) and help small communities to manage their assets ($60M).

Crombie also lauded the skills development portion of the budget.

""To help ensure that our workforce has the skills they need to succeed in a rapidly changing economy where precarious employment is on the rise, workers will be able to access up to $250 a year to help pay for training and income support through the new Canada Training Benefit,"" Crombie said.

""As I have said repeatedly, city-building is nation-building. As cities, we build the infrastructure that makes our economy and our country run. I'm pleased the federal government recognizes the important role that cities play in our federation and are making targeted investments to help us deliver services and build capital for all Canadians,"" Crombie said.",Mississauga to Receive ‘Tens of Millions’ from Trudeau Government,Mississauga's Top 5 Fish,https://www.insauga.com/mississauga-to-receive-tens-of-millions-from-trudeau-government

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe took aim Thursday at the prime minister’s comments about 9,000 jobs tied to the Quebec company.

“I remind the prime minister again, he’s not the prime minister of Quebec,” Moe said.

“He’s the prime minister for all Canadians.”

Moe said there have been thousands of jobs lost in the energy sector while Trudeau’s government has championed a carbon tax and a bill that would change how environmental assessments are done. Moe wants both scrapped.

Moe also criticized Trudeau for involving Canada’s ambassador to the United States, David MacNaughton, in the SNC-Lavalin issue when he should be working to get rid of U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said Thursday that Alberta’s struggle to get its oil to market has a far greater impact on jobs than SNC-Lavalin.

She also suggested jobs at the Quebec company would be more affected by Alberta’s economy than the outcome of any criminal prosecution SNC-Lavalin is facing.

“We need our federal government to focus on the big picture and, by doing that, they will realize that Albertans need their attention.”

Notley said earlier this week that Trudeau needs to get back to work defending jobs and farmers, especially since China has started blocking import shipments of Canadian canola.

“We are calling on Ottawa to stop its navel-gazing about its internal controversies and fight back,” she said.

Trudeau’s comments about protecting jobs at SNC-Lavalin has landed him in even more trouble with western premiers than he already was, said a political expert.

“It justifies accusations of double standards that have started flying,” said Julian Castro-Rea, who teaches political science at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.

“Some jobs seem to be more important to him than the jobs that are being lost here.”

While housing in Toronto and the GTA has been far from cheap for years, the lack of affordable homes in some of Canada's biggest cities has reached crisis levels and all levels of government are working to combat the potentially dangerous affects a troubled housing market could have on not just residents, but the overall economy.

While finding a solution will be difficult, the federal Liberal government recently released a much-anticipated budget that includes a new first-time home buyer incentive.

The budget marks Justin Trudeau's fourth and final pre-election budget. Aptly called Investing in the Middle Class, the plan—which focuses more on spending and not at all on austerity—will, ideally, work as a stimulus budget that will boost the middle working class.

The deficit is expected to grow under the plan, but since the Trudeau government promised increased investment in infrastructure and the middle-class back in 2015, the new budget isn't exactly a departure from the standard they set with voters four years ago.

But what's the impact on the housing market?

According to a recent Zoocasa blog post, some highlights include funding for new skills training programs, financial support for seniors and indigenous communities and notable changes for first-time home buyers.

In recent months, real estate experts have asked all levels of government to act to increase housing supply and make it easier for buyers to enter the market. Most notably, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) called on the federal government to eliminate the OSFI stress test that requires prospective buyers to qualify for mortgages at higher interest rates than they'll ultimately be paying.

The inability of people—especially young people—to purchase homes (condos in the GTA typically cost over $400,000), has led to disappointing sales numbers. It's also been squeezing the rental market.

The real estate industry has also called on the government to extend the maximum amortization period to 30 years for first-time buyers. As well, a recent national survey run by Zoocasa found Canadians wanted a greater payout than the $750 they currently receive from the First Time Home Buyers' Tax Credit.

To make things a little easier, the government has opted to share the first-time buyer mortgage burden.

The government has promised an expansion of the maximum amount of RRSP funds first-time buyers can access under the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), from $25,000 to $35,000, or $70,000 between couples buying together.

Over the coming year, it also plans to launch a brand new $1.25-billion mortgage equity sharing program called the First Time Home Buyers' Incentive, which will help offset mortgage costs for those entering the market for the first time.

""Under this new initiative, the government will provide first-time buyers with interest-free mortgage loans, up to 10 per cent for new builds and 5 per cent for existing housing stock, via the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC),"" explains Penelope Graham, managing editor, Zoocasa.

""The CMHC then retains the equity percentage in the home until the loan needs to be paid back, either when the home is sold or the mortgage matures.""

To qualify, buyers must be first timers and have a combined household income of $120,000 or less.

Graham says that while the new initiative (which will go into effect this fall) doesn't reduce the tougher qualification hurdles borrowers must satisfy, having a smaller mortgage amount up front will effectively shrink monthly payments, which will make it easier to pass the stress test.

Zoocasa points out that Finance Minister Bill Morneau said that on a $400,000 home with 10 per cent equity sharing, the Incentive would reduce monthly payments by $225 per month, or $2,700 per year.

""That's real help for people who want to own their own home. For young people. For families. For Canadians who need just that little extra help to make their dream of owning a home a reality,"" Morneau stated in his speech to the Speaker of the House in the Budget's unveiling.

The Canadian Real Estate Association has also spoken in favour of the new measure, with President Barb Sukkau stating,

""Millennials are passionate about owning their home, but many are worried they will never be able to because of higher home prices and tougher mortgage qualification rules. REALTORS have been advocating for the modernization of the HBP and are pleased to see it addressed in Budget 2019,"" said Barb Sukkau, president, Canadian Real Estate Association, in a statement.

I believe that all seniors, as well as others, deserve better treatment from the federal Liberal gang of PM Justin Trudeau in Ottawa. Justice for seniors could start with at least $1,500 to $1,600 monthly for those over 65 years of age.

I honestly think this is justified, especially at a time when our country and others are ramping up many billions of dollars annually on weapons of war and conflict in the world. Why are they spending vast amounts of money on harmful weapons instead of trying to extend the hand of friendships and kindness in our world for peace instead? In my opinion, when these many billions of our tax dollars are spent in this manner, then seniors should be entitled to a guaranteed income, a universal one for all. Why should some seniors over 65 years old get between $800 to $900 monthly while, to my understanding, others are getting double this amount? If our federal Liberals won't pick up on positive ideas like these by the public, then maybe the Conservative or NDP parties might have the vision, foresight, and kindness to pick up on them with a federal election looming this year. If you agree, you can write to your PM or MP and demand justice for seniors and less money on expensive weapons of war and extend the hand of friendship and peaceful ways in our world instead. It seems this makes a lot more sense than the way things are now going in our world.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Neil Bruce said Wednesday if the engineering firm is convicted and barred from bidding on federal contracts here at home its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company's foreign rivals.

""There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They'll get a job,"" Bruce said.

""This thing that somehow they're going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.""

Bruce's comments come as a political storm in Ottawa continues over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to end a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau and his staff have said their only concern was for SNC-Lavalin's 9,000 jobs, which might be at risk if the company were convicted and then barred from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and the country's top public servant, although he continues to insist no one did anything wrong.

Bruce said its Canadian workforce has decreased from 20,000 in 2012 and will likely fall further. That, despite it being the only Canadian company that does nuclear technology work helping Ontario facilities like Chalk River, Darlington and Pickering. Also, no other domestic firm does the scope of infrastructure services on projects in cities like Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.

He said the company has calculated that about 75 per cent of its rivals have concluded deferred prosecution agreements (DPA) in their host countries and are free to work in Canada.

Meanwhile, Bruce said he still doesn't know why the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould were not open to granting a remediation agreement.

He said the company appealed that decision in Federal Court, hoping to learn some of the rationale.

""We did an appeal not because we thought we would win the appeal but because we thought we might get a reason and that got tossed out with no reason so we still don't know.""

Bruce said he's not holding much hope that an agreement will be offered under the current political climate, especially if the Conservatives win the fall election, and is preparing for a lengthy legal process.

""We have never asked for the charges to be dropped, we've never asked for anything to be circumvented,"" he said. ""We just want to move on for the sake principally of our employees first and foremost and our investors.""

A main stumbling block to getting a DPA could be public perception that former employees accused of crimes aren't being held accountable, he said.

He said innocent SNC-Lavalin employees feel bruised and battered by the last six weeks since a report surfaced that government officials pressured the former attorney general to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

""And I think fundamentally that's unfair on our employees who had nothing to do with what went on seven to 20 years ago.""

While he's not surprised that politicians would make hay out of this issue during an election year, Bruce said he's concerned the company will continue to be a political punching bag as the campaign unfolds.

""If it sort of doesn't move on from that or gets worse of course it's a concern.""

Bruce also said few people have publicly defended the company's important contribution to the country as a home-grown success story.

""So if anybody's happy for us not being able to do that work and give it to the Americans or give it to the Europeans I think that's a sad, sad position.""

He said there's no plans to move the company's headquarters from Montreal, adding competitors are envious of its shareholder base that is 82 per cent Canadian and led by the Caisse de depot which has helped fund its acquisition of British engineering firm Atkins.

""We see ourselves as Team Canada. We are a global champion, one of few. There's not many and we're proud to be Canadian.""

Isn’t there an issue of legality when someone is being coerced to perform an illegal act even though the perpetuator deems it to be harmless advice? Is there any difference to someone asking an attorney-general to break the law and a scenario where someone is asked to steal something? Both are irresponsible suggestions, and in my opinion neither should be justified by saying it’s just idle chatter, and in the case of governing, saying: “It’s just part and parcel of conducting government business.”

article continues below

It might be seen as a harmless suggestion on the part of the government officials who tried to advise Wilson-Raybould, but in effect it was a real attempt to obstruct the justice system.

Even though I agree with Carla Qualtrough’s analysis of the situation as written in the Optimist, whereas Wilson-Raybould said in her testimony that she wasn’t directed to do something and that she didn’t think anything illegal happened.

So in retrospect nothing illegal took place... So what’s the problem? Well here it is in a nutshell: Think what might have happened if someone with less moral fortitude holding the position of attorney-general was approached and agreed to stand-down on a prosecution procedure? Would the government have looked the other way because it got what it wanted, or would it have taken the attorney general to task for interfering with the justice system? You and I both know that with all that has transpired recently, the legality of the situation would most likely have been overlooked and the attorney general’s transgression ignored because it benefited the governments’ point of view.

It’s only because Wilson-Raybould refused to bow to pressure that we now witness the shortcomings of leaders who think they can do whatever they want without fear of repercussions. Shame to Justin Trudeau, and to all who support him for letting the people of Canada down.

Heckling from Conservatives over the SNC-Lavalin affair during budget day has not done Opposition leader Andrew Scheer any favours, according to a former Liberal strategist.

""Part of the Opposition's job is to oppose, of course, but the other job is to present themselves as a government-in-waiting — that was not a government-in-waiting,"" said John Duffy, who was an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin, and is the founder of StrategyCorp.

As Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivered his budget speech Tuesday, the beginning of his speech was drowned out by noise from the benches opposite, in protest at the Liberal-majority justice committee shutting down an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Duffy told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that the Liberals ""were pretty realistic about what the Opposition was likely to do yesterday.""

""What we didn't expect was the spectacle. The pounding, the stamping, the hooting and hollering … really looking like a tantrum from a daycare centre.""

""I don't think Mr. Scheer did himself any favours in that.""

Conservative MPs banged on desks and jeered loudly during Finance Minister Bill Morneau's budget speech making it nearly impossible to hear what Morneau was trying to say. 0:26

Speaking after the budget was delivered, Scheer said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was using the budget to distract from the SNC-Lavalin affair, and accusations that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to intervene in the criminal case against the company.

""Mr. Trudeau's plan is obvious. Massive deficits to distract Canadians from his corruption before the election. Massive tax hikes to pay for them after the election,"" he said.

He added that Canadians ""demand answers on the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and Conservatives will do everything we can to get them.""

Angela Wright, a freelance political writer and Conservative strategist, said she understands ""where the frustration comes from"" for the Conservatives.

""Of course the government wants to talk about the budget, but they have to know that the Conservatives still want to talk about SNC-Lavalin,"" she told Tremonti.

Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say. - Angela Wright

However, despite their frustrations, they should recognize the importance of the budget, she said.

""If the government wants to deliver the budget, then Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say.""

""Then they can come out and continue to remind Canadians about SNC-Lavalin and the fact they're not going to let the issue go away.""

Leader of the Official Opposition Andrew Scheer threatens emergency actions to ensure Canadians hear the whole story on the SNC-Lavalin affair. 0:34

For their views on the latest from Parliament Hill, and how it could affect voters, Tremonti was joined by:

John Duffy, former Liberal strategist and advisor to former Prime Minister Paul Martin, founder of StrategyCorp, and author of Fights of Our Lives: Elections, Leadership and the Making of Canada.

Angela Wright, freelance political writer and Conservative strategist.

Kathleen Monk, former NDP strategist for Jack Layton, and a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group.

Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued two statements on the terrorist attacks in New Zealand on Friday -- the second after being criticized for not mentioning in the first that the attack was against Muslims at mosques during their Friday prayers.

Two Conservative MPs have also cancelled an event on Monday with a British parliamentarian who has been accused of promoting anti-Islamic sentiments ""out of respect"" for Muslims reeling from the attacks that killed 49 people.

Scheer posted to Twitter and Facebook late Thursday evening in Canada as news of the attacks was reported, saying ""freedom has come under attack"" and mentioning ""peaceful worshippers"" and a ""despicable act of evil.""

""All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear,"" he wrote.

But the statement was condemned quickly online for failing to specify that the attack was on Muslims, during prayers at mosques. Some pointed to the fact he did name Coptic Christians and call out anti-Semitism in previous tweets when killers attacked Egyptian churches in 2017 and a synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims criticized the omission in a statement Friday afternoon.

""While some of our elected leaders sadly choose not to mention `Muslim' or `mosque' while denouncing the Christchurch attacks, the reality is that these horrific shootings and the Quebec City mosque attack on Jan. 29, 2017, have left Canadian Muslim communities -- and indeed, Muslims around the world -- feeling very vulnerable and unsafe,"" wrote the Council's executive director Ihsaan Gardee. ""It is therefore essential that our elected leaders speak out clearly and unequivocally against such attacks and name them for the Islamophobic terrorist attacks that they are.""

The statement does not mention Scheer by name but at that point, he was the only Canadian political leader whose public response to the attacks did not mention either Muslims or mosques.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement condemned the attacks as terrorism and said everyone must work to ""confront Islamophobia.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that ""Islamophobia kills.""

Green Leader Elizabeth May did not mention Muslims in her first Tweet but retweeted several others who did.

Former Conservative Maxime Bernier, now the leader of the People's Party of Canada, hadn't posted anything about the attacks at all by late Friday.

Scheer's office did not respond to an initial query about the statement's not mentioning Muslims but after being asked about the statement from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, his spokesman responded with a link to a new statement on Scheer's Facebook page.

""As Canadians are learning the horrific details of last night's terror attack at two New Zealand mosques, I wish to express both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community,"" it said.

It said Conservatives stand with Muslims around the world to ""reaffirm our commitment to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together.""

A month ago, Scheer was criticized for sharing a stage on Parliament Hill with a cross-Canada truck convoy mostly protesting Liberal inaction on the energy industry but which included some people promoting hatred. Scheer said he was only there to support the energy workers, not the ""other elements that tried to associate themselves with the event.""

Those ""elements"" were people affiliated with the Canadian Yellow Vest movement, whose Facebook page included some comments celebrating the New Zealand attacks Friday.

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis tweeted Friday that Monday's reception with Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, has been cancelled.

Genuis, an Edmonton-area MP, and fellow Conservative MP Kelly Block of Saskatchewan were to co-host the reception with Cox, who has shown support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has said she believes Muslims are trying to destroy Western democracies with Shariah law.

Toronto Liberal MP Judy Sgro pulled out of the event after she found out about Cox's participation. Genuis initially rejected calls to follow suit, calling it a talk on human rights, and accused Sgro on social media of retreating only after she remembered this is an election year.

He said in a statement Friday that Cox's views are subject of ""some debate, and perhaps some confusion.""

""With that said, our friends in the Muslim community are now reeling from one of the most horrific and appalling terrorist attacks to ever target their community,"" he wrote. ""Out of respect for them, now is not the time for a conversation that could been (sic) misconstrued to take place on Parliament Hill. As such, the event will not be proceeding as planned.""","After criticism, Scheer adds word 'Muslim' to statement on New Zealand mosque attacks",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/after-criticism-scheer-adds-word-muslim-to-statement-on-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-1.4338025

At one point during the event in Kitchener, Ont. last night, a member of the audience rose to ask Scheer a two-minute question touching on several subjects, including immigration funding and international aid. He then linked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the mythical conspiracy known as ""pizzagate,"" which gained traction around the 2016 United States presidential election.

""Trudeau gave $600 million to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation is part of child trafficking and child sacrifice, if you study it. It's in the pizzagate,"" he said.

""The PM, if he knows about the foundation, should he be in jail for that one? Also, he needs to pay back the $600 million plus his trips to the Canadians.""

Watch the townhall exchange

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was asked about the government's contribution to the Clinton Foundation during a townhall. He later said he didn't hear a reference to ""pizzagate."" 5:12

The conspiracy theory accuses Clinton and her team of running a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza shop in Washington, D.C.

Pizzagate is often cited in discussions about the real-life dangers of false news online. In 2016, a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the restaurant as he attempted to ""self-investigate"" the unfounded internet rumours about Democrats hiding child sex slaves there.

While no one was injured in that incident, a U.S. judge told gunman Edgar Welch that his actions ""literally left psychological wreckage."" Welch was sentenced to four years in prison.

Pizzagate — which the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has called ""a fictitious online conspiracy theory"" — is largely believed to have gained momentum after WikiLeaks released emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, mentioning pizza parties and a fundraiser at the Comet restaurant. Some online communities theorized it was code for something more heinous.

In his response to the town hall questioner, Scheer did not say the pizzagate theory was false — although he did pick up on the Clinton Foundation angle to talk about Trudeau spending taxpayers' money on what he called ""personal projects.""

""Yes. Well, I appreciate your concerns on this,"" he replied.

""I can assure you that when you look at where Justin Trudeau has spent money, it's clear that a huge sum of the dollars that he is taken from Canadian taxpayers has gone to his own personal projects.

""You mentioned that the Clinton Foundation ... there are other examples where Justin Trudeau's government has given grants to hire people for groups that are, you know, advocating for their own particular ideology, specifically fighting against things like pipelines and building our infrastructure to be able to get our energy to international markets.""

When asked why he didn't confront the conspiracy theory at the time, Scheer said he didn't hear that part of the question.

""I heard the question was related to the government's, Justin Trudeau's decision to give a grant to the Clinton Foundation. That was what I answered. I didn't hear anything about the other aspect that you just mentioned,"" he told reporters during a stop in Rosser, Man. today.

""I didn't hear that. I heard the Clinton Foundation part of the question, I heard other parts of the question, but I certainly didn't hear that.""​

Watch: Scheer said he didn't hear pizzagate question

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

The Liberal government has pledged $20 million over five years to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which is affiliated with the foundation.

According to the Global Affairs website, the money is helping the initiative improve access to sexual and reproductive health services for women and girls in Nigeria.

A quick tally of the numbers posted to the government's website shows the previous Conservative government, of which Scheer was a part, actually contributed more to the initiative.

Going back to 2013, the Harper government spent nearly $19 million to help the initiative deliver vaccinations, $14 million on diarrhea treatment and about $460,000 to a fund tuberculosis research project on miners in African countries.

Scheer 'does not keep up with paranoid' theories

A spokesperson for Trudeau accused Scheer of promoting falsehoods, citing his attacks on the federal government's embrace of the UN Global Compact on Migration. Scheer has said he fears the document could exert an influence over Canada's immigration system — even though it is not a treaty and is not binding on the nations that support it.

Spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro also criticized Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" at the recent United We Roll protest with Faith Goldy, a former Rebel Media commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

(Jessica Gresko/Associated Press)

""It's no surprise Andrew Scheer refused to condemn this, given his clear history of promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misleading information, including his comments on the UN migration compact,"" said Catenaro. ""He has also refused to condemn the hateful language at recent events on Parliament Hill at which he shared the stage with far-right groups.""

Scheer's press secretary told CBC News today the Conservative leader ""does not keep up with paranoid, American alt-right conspiracy theories and as such was not familiar with the term until it came up in the questioning today.""

""Since learning about the pizzagate conspiracy, Mr. Scheer obviously believes it is ridiculous and dangerous, and that such conspiracies have no place in our political debate,"" said Daniel Schow in an email.

Trudeau also has been confronted with false allegations during his town hall tours.

Other leaders, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Premier Doug Ford all made specific mention to the victims being Muslim or at prayer in a mosque.

But Scheer’s initial statement suggested it was “freedom” under attack. “Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely without fear,” Scheer wrote Thursday night, adding “there are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred.” The statement was widely criticized on social media and by anti-racism advocates, who pointed to the Conservative party’s past policies — such as the proposed niqab ban and the “barbaric practices” tip line — as well as Scheer’s failing to specifically mention the terrorist attack clearly targeted Muslims.

“Houses of worship, like the two mosques attacked last night, should be places where all people can meet freely and without fear,” a quote attributed to Scheer read. “We stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters to ensure that they remain this way. We must condemn, in the strongest terms possible, the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.”

Bernie Farber, the head of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, pointed out that it took 15 hours of criticism before Scheer updated his statement. “I don’t want to sound at all political, because the Canadian AntiHate Network is not (political). What we do is we concentrate and we look at … what are the ingredients where hate can develop, and terrorism can develop,” Farber told the Star. “When he puts out a statement that won’t even acknowledge that the people murdered in New Zealand were New Zealand Muslims, when he speaks to a crowd that has a large number of racist and bigots and anti-immigration individuals (at a recent “yellow vest” protest on Parliament Hill) and says not a word? That’s what lets hatred grow.

Details about the Christchurch terrorist’s suspected motivations were available almost immediately, through a number of posts on 8chan, an online message board used by racists and bigots. A “manifesto” attributed to the shooter referenced a number of white supremacist and neo-Nazi tropes. Pictures believed to be of the terrorist’s rifles and ammunition show common far-right ideas and names of killers, including Alexandre Bissonnette, the Quebec City man who killed six Muslim men while at evening prayers in 2017. Scheer faced similar criticism last month for addressing a protest outside Parliament Hill that was also addressed by white nationalist Faith Goldy, a former television personality. The “United We Roll” protest convoy was initially associated with the Canadian version of the “yellow vest” protest movement — which mixes anger over economic challenges facing the oil and gas sector with outright Islamophobia. Organizers downplayed the association after facing media scrutiny. Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @alexboutilier

It’s an overreach, to be sure. But let’s grant Scheer a little latitude for his inflated rhetoric. As opposition leader, he has a duty to focus public attention squarely on the misdeeds of the government of the day.

Mission accomplished.

But eventually, when enough blows have been inflicted on the ruling party to ensure its alleged offences have been exposed and that reforms are being robustly debated, we should step back momentarily — even as the pummelling continues — and reflect on the credibility of the chief pummeller and his party, especially with regards to the intersection of politics and the law.

Recent Conservative history isn’t reassuring on this front. Though he spent time as Speaker of the House of Commons, Scheer was a member of the Stephen Harper government that waged a decade-long battle to bend Canada’s judiciary to the will of a Charter-averse, tough-on-crime Conservative party. The sins of the mentor aren’t his to bear, but Scheer does have to square his accusations about Liberals’ contempt for law with his own party’s record.

(Andrew) Scheer does have to square his accusations about Liberals’ contempt for law with his own party’s record.

And respect for the rule of law — its letter, its spirit, its institutions — was not a strong suit of Harper’s decade-long run as prime minister. He and his lock-step justice ministers oversaw numerous attempts to craft legislation with provisions that clearly violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

To Harper and his allies, it was a brave bid to reassert the dominance of Parliament over what they viewed as an excessively Charter-driven, Liberal-moulded justice system. To critics, it was a Conservative war on the rule of law and core Canadian values.

Remember the name Edgar Schmidt? He was the federal lawyer who took the Harper government to court because the alarms he and his fellow legal experts kept ringing — that planned Conservative legislation on sentencing, prostitution, fighting terrorism and more often failed basic Charter tests — were simply ignored.

There was, under Harper, an unprecedented partisan effort to transform the process for appointing judges — at all levels — to ensure that as many like-minded jurists as possible presided over Canada’s courts.

Remember the name Marc Nadon? He was Harper’s tough-on-crime appointee to a Quebec slot on the Supreme Court in 2013. But Nadon was not truly the senior Quebec jurist required for the appointment in question, as stipulated in the Constitution, as confirmed by the Supreme Court.

Beverley McLachlin, the now-retired chief justice of Canada, had the temerity to try to warn Harper (in line with her responsibilities) that the Nadon appointment was potentially out of order. Harper issued an unprecedented statement accusing the unimpeachable McLachlin of “inappropriate” behaviour — and was roundly condemned by the Canadian legal community for what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to undermine the independence and integrity of the country’s judiciary.

Harper biographer John Ibbitson described the incident as the “nadir” of the former Conservative prime minister’s decade in office: “Not only did he lose the fight; he tarnished his reputation and damaged what should be the sacrosanct separation of powers between executive and judiciary.”

In 2014, when he was Speaker, Scheer was interviewed about the forthcoming 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta and recalled that he’d been gifted a framed copy of the landmark English legal charter when he graduated from high school. It was a great reminder, he observed, of the deep roots of “the separation of powers from the executive to the judiciary.”

We’ve all heard Scheer’s vociferous defence of the rule of law in the context of alleged Liberal wrongdoing. As he seeks the prime ministership, he should be asked pointedly to explain his own party’s past actions and future plans on that front.

He should be asked, too, if he possesses framed copies of the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Imagine you’re a politician.

Even better, you’re the leader of a political party. The leader of the main opposition party, even. And yet, most Canadians wouldn’t know you if they tripped over you in the tool aisle of the local Canadian Tire.

What to do?

Especially when the Prime Minister—your target—is blessed with a famous name and the considerable advantages of incumbency. How do you shift his spotlight your way?

Short of lighting yourself on fire or dancing nude in the streets—or doing both together, I suppose—there isn’t much any opposition leader can do to up their profile in between election cycles. No, the life of an opposition leader is an endless cycle of low-impact rubber chicken dinners, bingo hall grip and grins, and sessions spent asking the Prime Minister questions he never ever answers.

So Andrew Scheer should count himself blessed that Justin Trudeau has lit himself on fire—an exquisitely engineered fire—over SNC-Lavalin. After all, it’s not every day a sitting Prime Minister cripples himself to the point where even Jagmeet Singh risks becoming competitive.

With Canadians now tuning into politics en masse, SNC is the chance for Scheer to demonstrate he has the royal jelly. When Mike Duffy started giving Stephen Harper nightmares, it was Thomas Mulcair who checked into the public’s imagination, keeping the issue alive with his prosecutorial performances in the House of Commons. And while Mulcair didn’t end up taking the big prize, he did put an afterthought party into pole position by the start of the election.

That is the size of the opportunity now before Scheer.

But if Canadians are impressed by what they’ve seen from Scheer personally in response to SNC, they’re doing a pretty good job of hiding it. While Conservative support has now surpassed that of Trudeau’s Liberals, Scheer’s personal numbers remain below Trudeau’s.

The differential in polling outcomes likely exists because people identify Trudeau much more strongly with his party than Scheer with his, and because the SNC debacle has, to date, been driven more by Trudeau’s missteps than Scheer’s interventions.

To wit, Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation (checks calendar) 12 days ago and Trudeau is (checks pm.gc.ca) still Prime Minister. Canadians will have noticed the misfire.

To be fair, several pundits matched Scheer’s premature call for Trudeau’s ouster, including some not overtly hostile to the Prime Minister, such was the shock of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony at the justice committee. But it’s one thing to get excited to sell papers; it’s another to lose your head in the rush for the head of the country’s government to lose theirs.

The call for Trudeau to go, absent all sides of the story being aired, will have smacked many as opportunism, something for the benefit of Scheer’s party, not his country. Yes, what Wilson-Raybould disclosed was deadly serious, but it wasn’t close to the full story. That Trudeau was—and remains—unwilling to offer a serious response to Wilson-Raybould, or let her speak about the circumstances surrounding her resignation, is the story. Trudeau is hiding something about his intrusion into the justice system.

Looked at through a more practical lens: when Trudeau goes is not even Scheer’s call to make in a majority Parliament. Absent a revolt from the Liberal caucus, or perhaps some criminal charges, Trudeau will be Prime Minister come this fall’s federal election. And while Trudeau’s head would be a helluva trophy, it might be better for a severely tainted Trudeau to lead his troops into that fight. Scheer should focus on inflicting a thousand cuts, not trying to land the killer blow.

What the SNC situation now calls for is a calm and systematic destruction of Trudeau’s arguments, such as he’s made them. The people who don’t follow politics need to see a robust defence of Canada’s institutions and constitutional conventions, along with clear reminders of what will be lost should Trudeau be allowed to skate away from the mess he’s made. Thankfully, the federal court and the OECD are already helping on these fronts; there is no need for Conservatives to over-egg the pudding.

And to Scheer’s credit, he’s showing signs of a recalibration. The Tories now appear ready to savour Trudeau’s pain like a fine wine, not like a beer in a frat house.

A sober and serious opinion piece under Scheer’s name has now appeared in the Toronto Sun, outlining how Trudeau’s deeds belie his words on SNC. The Conservative HQ Twitter feed is also smartly ramping up calls for Trudeau to allow Wilson-Raybould to testify to her resignation from Cabinet (something Wilson-Raybould herself has called for), pushing on an open door for women who now have serious questions about Trudeau’s feminist bonafides. The trick will be to keep up the tone.

With the Liberals now desperate to push the conversation to “pizzagate” and other elements of Michael Wernick’s vaunted social media “vomitorium,” the entire Conservative caucus needs to act like a government in waiting. No matter how good or clever that gut punch on Twitter might feel, the Tories should now heed to their better angels. Let Maxime Bernier’s crowd bray for blood; the SNC earthquake has opened up a deep seam of middle-of-the-road voters. Now it’s time to mine.

With the Prime Minister’s jobs claims now in dispute, the legal arguments for offering a DPA in tatters, and his strategy now to stay quiet and suppress all further testimony from either Wilson-Raybould or his staff, Trudeau has painted himself into an ugly corner. Scheer must satisfy himself with keeping Trudeau in that corner and hemming him in even further, not pushing for an outcome he can’t deliver.

In short, Canadians need to look at Scheer and see a Prime Minister in waiting. Someone with their interests at heart, and not his own, even if the two intersect.

In the wake of the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, what has to be stated loudly and clearly is that Islamophobia has become the last acceptable prejudice in allegedly polite society. And that those who may even reject racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia often still hold on to anti-Muslim views.

In Canada, this is even more evident on the political right, where on social media the reaction of some people to the slaughter of 50 Muslim worshippers (children among them and 40 more in hospital with gunshot wounds) was to blame Muslims for the violence and declare the notion that Islamophobia even exists as an attack on free speech.

There were also those that refused to ask the right questions about why this all happened in the first place. The Christchurch killer was at least in part motivated by the politics of Trump, much like Quebec City mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette. Both were consumed by right-wing groups online and Muslim immigration.

Then there were the responses from our political leaders. The Prime Minister’s was swift, referring directly to the context of the attack as part of a growing problem of white nationalist inspired terrorism. Not so Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who issued a banal tweet, declaring the Christchurch rampage was an attack on “freedom” rather than Muslim worshippers.

It took several hours of outrage and criticism – some privately from other Conservative MPs – for Scheer to issue a second statement the next day on Facebook, one that dared to refer specifically to what had happened and to acknowledge that Muslims had been murdered because of their faith. That was followed by a visit to a mosque in Regina in what looked like a hastily scheduled photo opportunity.

Many of Scheer’s defenders rushed to justify his characterization of the attack, claiming that his critics were too harsh, and that while their leader may not have been specific in his language there was really nothing that should be read into this. That, however, is terribly misleading and disingenuous or even dishonest.

Scheer is not a stupid man, and is fully capable of properly expressing himself. He also knows that a great number of his supporters have at best an ambivalent attitude towards Muslims and often view Islam as a downright threat to what they like to describe as Judeo-Christian values.

Scheer and his senior advisors, such as former Rebel Media executive Hamish Marshall, who will head the Conservative party's 2019 campaign, certainly understand this and don't want to alienate those in their base.

Those among Scheer's supporters in media who condemned the atrocity, argued that far worse things are done to Christians by Muslims in Africa and the Middle East on a regular basis. It’s a classic digression technique.

As someone who has written and broadcast for 20 years about the persecution of Christians by Muslim extremists I know the reality of all this, but it should not be allowed in any way to obscure the horror and danger of the rampant Islamophobia that exists in Western society.

If Scheer tried to be relatively subtle in his response, People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier went further, at first saying nothing at all about Christchurch.

When journalist Stephen Maher quite rightly noted his silence, Bernier responded bizarrely via Twitter. “Some journalists have no decency. Did this one harass me or anybody else when dozens of Christians were massacred in Nigeria and the Philippines weeks ago? Why not? As a rule I don’t comment on these horrible tragedies in other countries. Period.”

Bernier may now be a fringe player in charge of a ragtag party of extremists, but it should be remembered that he was widely viewed at one time as the likely successor to Stephen Harper, and the man who was assumed to be the next leader of the Conservative Party before he lost the leadership race to Scheer on the 13th ballot, with more than 49 per cent of the vote.

He was eventually kicked out of the party and is still viewed as a threat to Scheer's political fortunes. But if Scheer has an Islamophobia problem in his party, Bernier is virtually dependent on the damned thing.

As well as being unethical and irresponsible, the reactions of both Scheer and Bernier are profoundly dangerous. Silence or ambiguity about evil emboldens those who are likely to commit grievous acts and blurs an issue that should be black and white.

Scheer did eventually say the right thing, but his reluctance to do so is what speaks the loudest. As for Bernier, his pandering to bigotry positively roars.

Responding to the horrific massacre of Muslims at prayer in New Zealand, the Conservative leader issued a statement Friday afternoon expressing his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community” along with “the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.” He added: “To the Muslim community around the world and here at home in Canada, we stand with you.”

It was spot on: straightforward, fitting and right. It was also about 15 hours too late, coming as it did only after Scheer had come under intense criticism for the inadequacy of his first response, which spoke vaguely of an attack on “freedom” and unspecified “worshippers.” The appositeness of the second only highlighted the strange, withholding coldness of the first.

Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear. 1/2 — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) March 15, 2019

We cannot know exactly what explains that initial, catastrophic choice of words. But neither is Scheer automatically entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Politicians are in the business of being politic, of saying the right thing at the right time, and nothing goes out over their name without a great deal of thought, not to say calculation.

Other party leaders managed to name the victims — Muslims — and the beliefs — white supremacism, Islamophobia, the familiar, toxic mix of racism, xenophobia and hatred that so often finds Muslims as its target — involved in what was self-evidently an act of terrorism. Why on earth couldn’t Scheer?

The suspicion that this was no accident is not unreasonable, given Scheer’s past statements and actions. Perhaps he truly did not hear the questioner at a recent town hall who invoked “pizzagate,” the lunatic conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex ring supposedly operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.

But nothing required him to speak at last month’s “United We Roll” rally on Parliament Hill, whose stated purpose — to protest federal environmental policies on behalf of unemployed workers in the oil industry — may have been legitimate, but which had clearly been infiltrated by anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant elements. At the very least, he might have taken the opportunity of his appearance to denounce these views. He did not.

Just as disturbing was Scheer’s recent endorsement of conspiracy-minded interpretations of a United Nations document called the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, an unenforceable statement of good intentions with regard to the handling of immigrants and refugees to which most of the world’s nations agreed last year.

This, on top of his party’s unceasing alarmism on the subject of the asylum seekers entering Canada illegally via our southern border — a legitimate issue, to be sure, and one on which the government may deserve criticism, but nothing like the existential “crisis” of so much Conservative rhetoric.

And before that there was the hysteria over M-103, a non-binding motion — not a bill — condemning Islamophobia that was somehow elevated, via the panic mills of the populist right, into an assault on freedom of speech worthy of a police state. The motion passed two years ago. Not one person has since been carted off for criticizing Islam or faced sanctions of any kind because of M-103.

And before that there was the gratuitous ban on face-coverings at citizenship ceremonies. And the “barbaric practices” snitch line. The federal Conservatives are not by any means the only party to pander to racial and religious intolerance — Dalton McGuinty’s Liberals won an election in Ontario in 2007 on a coded anti-Muslim fear campaign, while the government of Quebec’s baiting of the province’s religious minorities enjoys near all-party support — but they are surely the most consistent. Or were, until Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party came along.

And it seems to be growing worse: as xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric is normalized by repetition on social media and other online sites — most notoriously The Rebel — so a certain section of the public has been radicalized, persuaded that only “globalists” and other elites could oppose such disgraceful sentiments. Exploiting public fears of immigrants and minorities has a long and dishonourable tradition in this country. But exactly what kind of voter did Scheer worry would be put off by explicitly naming the sole victims and declared targets of a mass murderer?

That all of this is happening in the wake of the 2017 murders at a Quebec City mosque — the New Zealand attacker cited it as a model — makes this winking indulgence of the worst elements of the populist right particularly reprehensible.

Obviously neither Scheer nor The Rebel is responsible, in themselves, for the actions of terrorists. But they can be held to account for their part in creating the climate of opinion in which extremists flourish and madmen find inspiration. After Christchurch, after Quebec City, after Brevik and other atrocities, this is hardly a theoretical concern.

None of this is to justify further limits on free speech: we lack the kind of certainty about cause and effect that would even begin to make a case for legal restrictions, and we know from long experience how such laws can be abused. But all of us are morally responsible for the things we say, or do not say. Each of us is part of a moral order it is our duty to sustain — political leaders most of all.

This isn’t about censorship, or political correctness. It’s about judgment, and choices.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs unsuccessfully pressed the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould so she could shed more light on the simmering controversy.

The motion this morning came after a letter late Monday to chair Anthony Housefather in which five Liberal MPs on the committee indicated that they were keen to leave remaining investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair to the ethics commissioner and to block any further testimony from Wilson-Raybould, the former minister of justice and the attorney general.

“We’ve heard 13 hours of comprehensive testimony from over 10 witnesses,” states the letter from the five Liberals. “No witness was prevented from providing evidence on any relevant information during the period covered by the waiver, which was the focus of the Committee’s review.”

“Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, the perspectives and relevant legal principles.”

But Wilson-Raybould, who has already given nearly four hours of testimony, has indicated that she has more to say, particularly about the period between her mid-January move from Justice to Veteran Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Opposition MPs had also asked for her return to the committee, after noting inconsistencies between Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and subsequent version of events from former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair. “What happened today is absolutely outrageous,” said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

“If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister’s misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “thumbing his nose” at Canadians, and said the official Opposition would use “every tool available to us” to hold the government accountable in Parliament.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

However, the Conservatives have forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs studying fisheries to travel, which could delay Morneau’s speech at least 35 minutes.

Scheer called the government’s budget “a political prop” in its “unprecedented cover-up” of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau’s top adviser and the country’s most senior public servant to resign.

The letter, signed by Randy Boissonnault, Iqra Khalid, Ali Ehsassi, Ron McKinnon and Colin Fraser, stated that the committee approached the investigation with an “open mind” and afforded testimonial opportunities for all those involved.

“Traditionally Cabinet confidence and Solicitor-Client privilege would have prevented several of these witnesses from disclosing much of what they did divulge to the Committee,” the letter read. “We appreciate that the Government took the extraordinary step of waiving these confidences.”

The letter also accused the opposition of rushing ‘to judgement even before hearing all the relevant information.”

The actions stated in the letter have been criticized by NDP and Conservative leaders alike. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the move “a massive coverup” and condemned Trudeau on social media.

“Justin Trudeau has lawyered up. His Liberal MPs will shut down the Justice committee. The only possible conclusion Canadians can reach is that Trudeau is engaged in a massive coverup,” he said.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh agreed with Scheer. “That means no more testimony and no more answers that you deserve,” he said on Twitter.

This isn’t the first time the Liberals have been accused of silencing the debate around the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Opposition MPs on the committee erupted with the words ‘coverup’ and ‘shame’ on March 13, after Liberal MP Francis Drouin “expressed” the committee’s wishes to delay the debate around Wilson-Raybould’s second testimony.

Scheer ended his statement with a message for Muslim communities in Canada and internationally. The Conservative party is committed ""to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together,"" he said.

Other Tories quicker to denounce violence toward Muslims

Attacks on freedom is political rhetoric that has been embraced by fringe conservative groups to amplify anti-globalist and anti-immigrant messages. In Canada, these viewpoints have been notably represented by Yellow Vests Canada, a spinoff group inspired from the French anti-government movement.

Yellow Vests Canada members have spread messages advocating violence against politicians and hatred toward Muslims. The group was associated with last month's United We Roll convoy, which culminated with a rally on Parliament Hill. Scheer and People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier were invited speakers who addressed the crown on the main stage.

White nationalist Faith Goldy was also at the rally, but did not address the crowd from the main stage. She briefly gave some remarks from a scissor lift which served as an impromptu stage set on a flatbed truck parked on the street.

Some of the Scheer's federal conservative peers, such as Ontario Premier Doug Ford and former federal leadership candidates Michael Chong and Lisa Raitt, chose more explicit language off the bat.

'Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain' in places of worship: PM

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement Friday condemning the terrorist attack on two Christchurch mosques.

The gunman, whose identity has yet to be confirmed by police, reportedly had Quebec mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette's name written on a magazine clip, suggesting inspiration from the Canadian tragedy that killed six people and left 19 injured.

""Far too often, Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain in the places where they should feel safest,"" Trudeau said. ""Canada remembers too well the sorrow we felt when a senseless attack on the Centre culturel islamique de Québec in Ste-Foy claimed the lives of many innocent people gathered in prayer.""

Trudeau continued to state how Canada will continue to work with New Zealand to ""take action against violent extremism.""

""Hate has no place anywhere,"" he said. ""We must all confront Islamophobia and work to create a world in which all people—no matter their faith, where they live, or where they were born—can feel safe and secure.""

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin finds itself at the centre of a national political storm over allegations prime ministerial aides crossed a line in leaning on Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair.

""What happened today is absolutely outrageous,"" said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

""If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister's misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.""

Liberals on the justice committee wrote to the chairman, fellow Liberal Anthony Housefather, this week to say the committee had done its job and should move on to other business.

""As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,"" says the letter. ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed. Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.""

Liberal committee member Randy Boissonault reiterated the contents of the letter following the meeting, saying Tuesday's session was the 10th in five weeks, amounting to 13 hours of testimony given by 10 witnesses.

""We have heard from many of the key players in this matter,"" he said.

The Liberal members tabled a motion Tuesday calling for the committee to begin a study of the rise of hate crimes in Canada.

They say the federal ethics commissioner, who has launched a probe of the SNC-Lavalin matter, is best suited to investigate the political controversy.

They also note former justice minister Anne McLellan has been appointed to explore the relationship between the government and the minister of justice, who plays a second role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

But the opposition would have none of it.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said the committee should hold town-hall meetings on SNC-Lavalin and hear from Canadians about the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has a right to reply to other witnesses including Gerald Butts, the former top adviser to Trudeau, Raitt said in objecting to the Liberal effort to move on.

""They're controlling what is being said, they're controlling who is being heard from, they're controlling whether or not we study a topic. This is really egregious and absolutely shameful.""

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin called it ""yet another effort to change the channel"" by the government.

SNC-Lavalin faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya. The company unsuccessfully pressed the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a ""remediation agreement,"" a legal means of holding an organization to account for wrongdoing without a formal finding of guilt.

The director told SNC-Lavalin in October that negotiating a remediation agreement would be inappropriate in this particular case.

Wilson-Raybould has told the justice committee she was relentlessly pressured to ensure the Montreal engineering giant was invited to negotiate an agreement. She was shuffled from the justice portfolio in January, becoming veterans affairs minister.

Trudeau has denied that any undue pressure was placed on Wilson-Raybould.

She has testified at the justice committee for nearly four hours, but has indicated there is more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Butts, once considered Trudeau's right-hand man, quit his job as principal secretary, saying he did not want to be a distraction from the government's agenda. In addition, Jane Philpott left cabinet over the government's handling of the controversy.

The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country's top public servant, having concluded he's lost the trust of opposition parties.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Trudeau partly waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality so Wilson-Raybould could speak publicly, but not about communication with Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions.

Last week, Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts testified that he believed no one from the Prime Minister's Office had done anything wrong.

Butts also said that Wilson-Raybould never complained about improper pressure to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin until Trudeau decided to move her out of her cabinet role as justice minister.

Scheer said Sunday it is clear the ""real Justin Trudeau"" is being exposed to Canadians, adding that the prime minister is not displaying good leadership.

On Saturday, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office acknowledged Trudeau had ""emotional"" conversations with Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes, but denied her claims the encounters were ""hostile"" or that Trudeau yelled at her.

She alleges he yelled at her in that conversation and she responded by shouting back at him, however she added the prime minister later apologized.

Caesar-Chavannes also detailed another encounter with Trudeau in the House of Commons a week later, in which she describes him as acting hostile toward her.

My concern is not that the Conservatives wish to return tax money to taxpayers hands, my concern is with how they intend to do it. Scheer says ...","It seems the Conservatives in Canada got their heads together and made several significant policy announcements – significant not in the sense that, when isolated, these policy changes will affect anyone much, but significant because of the signal they send as to which direction Conservatives want to take Canada. The Manitoba Pallister government announced that it will be reducing the PST by 1% and it will not charge PST of the Federal Carbon tax. Andrew Scheer announced that a federal Conservative government will return the GST collected on home heating.

My concern is not that the Conservatives wish to return tax money to taxpayers hands, my concern is with how they intend to do it. Scheer says “Heating your home in winter isn’t a luxury for Canadians. It is a necessity. We don’t tax other basic necessities like groceries and we shouldn’t be taxing home heating.” Of course Scheer is correct when he says heating our homes in the Canadian winter is not a luxury, but it does not follow that the appropriate response is to reimburse Canadians for the cost of heating.

We all know that there are many ways of lowering our energy bill. We can lower the thermostat and wear a sweater, we can add insulation to the house, we can choose to live in a smaller house, we can choose to share living space in some way, we can install a high efficiency furnace, we can heat with a renewable energy source – and our government can give us a rebate on the energy we buy. The difference between the first options listed and the government rebate is that the first options actually result in greater energy efficiency, the result is real savings, whereas the latter, the government rebate, simply transfers money from the government pocket to the homeowner pocket. The government rebate does not result in a real saving.

But it is worse than that. The proposed rebate on the tax paid on heating expense is really a counter incentive.

To the family looking for help purchasing basic human needs such as groceries and home heating, it does not matter whether the extra $100 or $200 comes as a rebate on heating costs or as a reduction on income tax.

The reduction in income tax is not likely to create any incentive to modify behaviour. In terms of behavioural change, so a reduction in income tax is a neutral. It will put more money into the hands of the ordinary person, but that rebate money is unlikely to change his behaviour. However high heating costs will encourage a change in behaviour. Families facing high heating costs will look for ways of reducing their energy consumption. This is a good thing.

Furthermore, the heating tax rebate will, in effect, penalize those who have already done the right thing and reduced their heating cost. A homeowner who has expended the capital cost and built a net zero house, a house where all heat energy is generated from solar, will get no government rebate becasue he has bought no fuel.

Granted, $100 or $200 per year is not enough money to produce much of an incentive. A true incentive would need to be more substantial. This is why we have, in previous columns, criticized the Liberal Carbon Tax as being too timid. But this recent announcement from Mr. Scheer seems to be indicating which direction the Conservatives are moving.

While criticizing the Liberal Carbon Tax, Mr. Scheer has been unwilling to tell Canadians how Conservatives will deal with carbon emissions. If this recent announcement is an indication of what to expect from the Federal Conservatives, we and our children are in big trouble indeed. Nature does not negotiate.

TORONTO -- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is set to release a memoir, ""Love & Courage,"" in the lead-up to the federal election.

Publisher Simon & Schuster says the book follows Singh, who is Sikh, from childhood as he learns lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging.

Rather than a political memoir, it's being billed as a story about ""how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.""

The title alludes to Singh's oft-invoked call for ""love and courage,"" which he deployed in a viral response to a heckler at a 2017 NDP leadership campaign event.

After taking the reins of the federal party, Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons in a byelection last month.

His sights are now set on the post of prime minister as Canadians prepare to vote in this fall's federal election.

""This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up -- sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,"" Singh said in a statement.

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

By winning a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South, Jagmeet Singh becomes the first visible minority leader of a federal political party in this country’s history. He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto.

Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation.

But he may have to wait a few more months – until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign – for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

The NDP leader’s belated entry in the Commons comes at a time when the current Parliament is on its last legs - with its most productive days behind it.

Tuesday’s budget – the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office – marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future.

In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda.

One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more.

But the SNC-Lavalin affair – and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction – has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic.

As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue.

Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring.

So might Singh.

The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage.

Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000.

On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals.

Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner.

Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago.

Like Clark, who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs, the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.

In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of New Democrat MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at nine per cent, two points ahead of the NDP.

The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall.

As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

He is the first leader of a major political party in Canada’s parliament who is not white, a distinction that Singh acknowledged after question period as something he never could have imagined when he was growing up.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is introduced by NDP MP Peter Julian and Ruth Ellen Brosseau as he takes his place in the House of Commons on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

On March 17, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was officially sworn in as the MP for Burnaby South. The election of the first racialized federal party leader to Parliament is of great historic significance.

Wanting to do my part, I travelled to BC to campaign for Singh. I wanted to make a positive contribution to the effort in light of the gloomy press coverage (some predicting Singh’s demise) that was hanging over the campaign like a dark cloud.

I was eager to know what people on the ground were thinking and feeling about the by-election. It quickly became apparent that young people engineering Singh’s operation were enthusiastic, dedicated and curious.

There were also some of the more seasoned organizers. One who flew in from Brampton proudly told me that he just got accepted into law school at the University of Ottawa, my alma mater. I asked how it felt. He said it paled in comparison to the idea of Singh winning the riding. People were nervous as they confronted the weight of history.

This was no casual by-election. The media, taking the attitude of “do or die,” reminded us of that every day. This was an election that would either usher in a new era in Canadian politics or turn back the clock for under-represented communities.

So when the polls closed and the results finally poured in, the scene was electric at the Hilton Vancouver Hotel. We did it. The moment to shift the national discourse into an unapologetically progressive direction is here.

There is a real opportunity for an NDP breakthrough in this volatile political climate, but it must articulate a bold and truly transformative agenda on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, electoral reform, criminal justice reform, pharmacare and the housing crisis. The plight of working-class people across this country demands aggressive no-nonsense representation.

In Burnaby, Singh was able to appeal to a multiracial working class constituency with a left-populist campaign that focused on the fundamental unfairness of the economy and issues of housing affordability. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated an ability to appeal to marginalized communities that represent a growing share of the electorate.

Many activists on Singh’s campaign were inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing women of colour recently elected to congress in the U.S. who are challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a Green New Deal, free tuition, medicare for all and immigration reform.

There are lessons to be learned here from this new group of political leaders south of the border. It’s time for a new generation of progressive activists in this country, ones who boldly stand for social and economic justice and reflect the diversity of modern Canada, to step forward.

He won a byelection in Burnaby South on Feb. 25 to replace former MP and current mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart.

Singh also made history as the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Parliament.

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliamentary debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliamentary-debut-1.23667389

Ottawa: Indian-origin Jagmeet Singh has created political history in Canada when he made his debut in the House of Commons as the first non white leader of a major opposition party in the country.

The arrival of the turbaned leader into the house on Monday, cheered by all members, coincided with the induction of a senior woman member into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet.

Singh, 40, the leader of the New Democratic Party, placed his hand over his heart as he walked into the House of Commons, the lower of house of Parliament, before the daily question period.

He was elected in federal by-elections held on February 25.

Singh’s first words as an elected lawmaker were about last week’s terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand.

“I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters… in Christchurch,” he said.

About 50 people were killed last week in the Pacific country’s worst-ever mass shooting.

He then launched his first question about housing in Burnaby-South.

“I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,” Singh said.

“However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?” he said.

Prime Minister Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government’s record on fighting poverty.

Singh’s remarks echoed the mood of the House on a crucial day when the prime minister was beleaguered by the resignations of his two key cabinet colleagues.

Speculations are rife that the last budget of the Trudeau government with an eye on the general elections in October is expected to have several attractions for the middle class.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Anyone who followed the 2013 B.C. election or the recently Nanaimo byelection will know that polls can be pretty unreliable.

article continues below

So keep this in mind while reading the results of a Nanos Research poll posted today that has the federal NDP – led by new Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh getting a pretty big bump in support.

The latest Nanos federal ballot tracking has the Conservatives at 35.5 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 32.6 per cent, the NDP at 19.9 percent, the BQ at 3.2 per cent, the Greens at 7.7 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

The NDP for the longest time has been mired at 13 to 14 per cent, with the party also struggling to raise money.

So to have a showing at nearly 20 per cent is to be considered positive news. The CBC’s poll tracker – which aggregates all publicly available polling data – has the NDP at 15.9 per cent.

The bad news for Singh is the other number Nanos had.

Nanos tracking has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as PM at 30.3 per cent of Canadians followed by Scheer (27.3%), Singh (8.9%), May (7.2%) and Bernier (2.8%). Twenty-two per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

So Singh is way down the list and has a lot of work to do. Things could get better now that he is an MP and gets to speak in the House of Commons. He needs to build his profile and fast because October is getting closer and closer.

Singh is getting huge assists from Trudeau with SNC-Lavalin and Scheer with his blunder after the New Zealand massacre.

Let’s see what he can do with these missteps.

For theNanos poll, the data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews using live agents of 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over.

Sporting a bright yellow turban, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh entered the House of Commons for the first time as an MP Monday to loud cheers.

Singh is the first minority leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney ...,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

They trail the United Conservatives by a significant margin and the polls suggest the NDP would be booted from office if the election were held today.","As the Alberta provincial election campaign kicks off, Rachel Notley's New Democrats are in a tough spot. They trail the United Conservatives by a significant margin and the polls suggest the NDP would be booted from office if the election were held today.

But the election is still more than three weeks away and there is reason for Notley to believe her fortunes could improve. The trend line is inching in her direction and she's more popular than her party; UCP Leader Jason Kenney, her chief rival, is less popular than his.

Nevertheless, the New Democrats have a serious challenge ahead of them. That trend line has a long way to go before the election looks competitive, let alone one the NDP is in a position to win.

The CBC's Alberta Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data, puts the United Conservatives ahead with 50 per cent support among decided voters, followed by the New Democrats at 35.3 per cent.

The Alberta Party trails at a distance with 7.4 per cent, while the Liberals are polling at 4.8 per cent of the vote.

This is not significantly different than where things stood on election night four years ago. The Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties, which merged to form the UCP in 2017, combined for 52 per cent of the vote in 2015, only two percentage points higher than where the UCP stands today. The NDP, which captured 40.6 per cent of the vote, is down only about five points — still putting it on track for the second best performance in the party's history.

But the lack of a divided right changes the electoral math dramatically. With current levels of support, the Alberta Poll Tracker estimates the UCP would win between 61 and 76 seats — far more than the 44 needed to secure a majority government. The NDP would win between 11 and 25 seats, with the Alberta Party and Liberals in the running for no more than one apiece.

A polling error of the same magnitude as the one that occurred in the 2012 election — when Wildrose was given a wide lead in the last polls of the campaign, only for the PCs to hold onto to power — if repeated in Alberta next month, would still only put the UCP and NDP roughly tied. Even that scenario would be unlikely to re-elect the New Democrats due to their concentration of support in Edmonton.

NDP's strength in Edmonton, UCP everywhere else

That is where Notley's party still has its greatest strength. The Alberta Poll Tracker puts the NDP at 44.6 per cent in the city, with the UCP a few points back at 40 per cent. That level of support would likely divide Edmonton between the two parties in terms of seats.

But in the rest of the province, the UCP holds sway. In Calgary, Kenney's party is ahead by about 22 points in the Poll Tracker, with 54 per cent support compared to 32 per cent. That puts every seat in range of the UCP, while the New Democrats are in contention to hold just a handful of theirs.

Outside of the two cities, the United Conservatives are ahead by about 27 points. With between 28 and 31 seats, the rural areas of the province alone could put the UCP three-quarters of the way to a majority government.

Thin silver linings for the NDP

However, there are some silver linings for Notley in the numbers.

The most important one is that she is a plus for her party while Kenney is a minus. A Leger survey conducted between March 7 and 12 found the two party leaders virtually tied on the question of who Albertans think would make the best premier, with Notley at 33 per cent and Kenney at 32 per cent.

Taking into account the undecideds in the Leger poll on both the voting intentions and best premier questions, this suggests that Notley is about four percentage points more popular than the NDP. Kenney is two points less popular than the UCP.

Jason Kenney's United Conservatives enter the Alberta election campaign with a wide lead in the polls. (Amber Bracken/Canadian Press)

The difference was even starker in an Ipsos/Global News poll conducted between Mar. 15 and 17. It found Kenney at 33 per cent on the best premier question and Notley not far behind at 30 per cent, but again this suggests that Notley scores two points higher than the NDP among all voters. Kenney scores nine points worse than the UCP.

The hope for the NDP is that Notley is able to pull her party's support up while Kenney drags the UCP's down. This is clearly the party's strategy in the campaign so far, as the NDP leader's name takes prominence in the party's branding and her political attacks target Kenney personally.

The trend lines are also heading in a positive direction for the NDP, if marginally so. Leger puts the party up two points since last year, while ThinkHQ shows it up eight points since the end of 2017.

The inevitability of the UCP?

But the margin the NDP has to overcome remains enormous. While Kenney's personal popularity doesn't help the United Conservatives, the unpopularity of the NDP government might prove too much of an anchor weighing Notley down. In the Ipsos survey, just 31 per cent of Albertans said the NDP deserved re-election — losing numbers in a two-horse race.

The impact of the latest controversies surrounding Kenney's successful bid for the UCP leadership have yet to be fully recorded in the polls. They could sap UCP support further. But the 2018 Ontario election campaign, which ended with Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives defeating Kathleen Wynne's Liberals, showed that unpopular opposition leaders hobbled by controversy can still win big when voters want to see the incumbent government ousted.

The UCP has led in voting intentions since it was created and not once since coming to power have the New Democrats matched their 2015 election score in the polls. Even that probably wouldn't be enough to secure a victory when the right is no longer divided.

The potential for Notley to turn this into a competitive race exists. But she has a long way to go to cast doubt on the inevitability of a victory by Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives.",Rachel Notley's NDP starts Alberta campaign with big hill to climb,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/grenier-alberta-polltracker-1.5064584?cmp=rss

""There is a very significant scandal right now,"" said Notley.

""At its very best, it amounts to very dark backroom politics focused on thwarting democracy.""

The NDP is framing the imminent election campaign as a clear choice between Notley and Kenney.

That's how the NDP see it, that's how they'll play it, and that's what their entire re-election hope hangs on.

A fighting chance

If the NDP had been feeling a little beaten up after trailing the upstart UCP since before the party was born, you'd never know it from the crowd reaction at the Sunday afternoon rally in Edmonton-Strathcona.

In the distant background were several NDP candidates, many of them cabinet ministers. But they were just faces in the crowd, and weren't even introduced.

It was all about Notley.

She raised familiar themes about policy differences between the NDP and UCP on education, and about needing a credit card to pay for healthcare.

And then, subtle digs against Kenney — and some all-out attacks against him.

It is alleged that during the 2017 UCP leadership race, Kenney's campaign worked alongside Jeff Callaway's campaign to attack and undermine Brian Jean.

Both Kenney and Callaway have denied collaborating in a kamikaze campaign.

Kenney chalks up his team's interactions with Callaway's team during the leadership race to normal communications of one camp looking for second-ballot support.

Notley sees it differently, and so do her NDP supporters.

It's a turn of events that has galvanized the NDP — at least for now.

Leaders the 'centrepiece' of party

Andy Knight, a University of Alberta political science professor, says pinning all hopes on Notley is a ""very smart"" approach by the NDP.

""I think the political leader of the party will be looked at very seriously,"" said Knight, who co-wrote a book on political leadership in 2009, The Ashgate Research Companion to Political Leadership.

The leaders, said Knight, are the ""centrepieces"" for the vision and integrity of the party.

""At the end of the day, I think the leader still is going to be the one that's most important for the people around the province who are voting.""

Knight characterized Kenney as a smart political operative, a ""political animal"" who likely had the best chance of winning the UCP leadership race from the get-go.

Kenney, who steamrolled his agenda to unite a fragmented political right in Alberta, was widely praised in political circles for finally bringing together various brands of conservatives under one banner.

Kenney first won the PC leadership, then brokered a deal with the Wildrose and eventually became the first UCP leader in a landslide.

As just one example: Brian Jean is once again talking to his former rival Derek Fildebrandt, who leads the upstart Freedom Conservative Party. Neither have anything good to say about Kenney these days.

The NDP is calling on the provincial government to do more to help municipalities confront climate change.

The party introduced a bill last week that would create a local action on climate change fund.

It calls for a pot of money municipalities would be able to access to help with climate change-related projects that require new staff, or to support existing staff, planning work or in construction of physical infrastructure.

NDP municipal affairs critic Lisa Roberts said the goal is to reduce the barriers for municipalities looking to take action on climate change.

That also includes addressing questions of jurisdiction. The bill would clear the way for municipalities to be in control of green energy generation.

""We want to make it clear because we recognize that there is urgent need to act,"" she said. ""And where there is energy and good ideas from municipalities, we want to say, 'Yes, go, do it now.'""

The other key aspect of the bill is setting aside up to $62,500 to create a staff position within the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities that would be dedicated to helping municipalities access federal funding programs for climate change or environmental sustainability projects.

Roberts said her caucus has heard concerns from some smaller, more financially challenged municipalities that they don't have the resources to dedicate the necessary time to pursue federal funding.

""It doesn't make sense necessarily to try to put those resources at each municipality, especially when often there can be learning that can be done across municipalities,"" she said.

Yarmouth Mayor Pam Mood, who is also vice-president of the federation, said they support anything that would make things easier for cash-strapped municipalities, especially if it's something everyone can share.

""I think it would make a huge difference,"" said Mood.

© CBC CBC

""As municipalities big and small, we're certainly doing everything we can with regard to climate change. We know how important it is, but somehow we have to be able to pay for it.""

Currently, municipalities have access to provincial programs for flood-risk infrastructure and a program that can be used for storm water and wastewater projects.

Municipal Affairs Minister Chuck Porter said that while he's not heard concerns from municipalities, he knows climate change is a pressing issue across the province.

Porter said he believes the programs in place are working, but he's also open to reviewing what's offered and considering other ideas.

""We're always open to this. This is ever-changing, and we have to be — it's very fluid.""

The minister noted municipalities also have the ability to work together when it comes to planning. He said they can share resources or one council can buy a service from another council.

""It doesn't really matter about how big or how small you are,"" he said. ""It makes sense from a financial perspective for two or three or four municipalities in a region to work together on this thing,"" he said.

But Day Two of the election campaign, Premier Notley told us to stay tuned to what Sarah Hoffman had to say.

Enter Hoffman, the NDP deputy premier, whose job in this good cop/bad cop movie is to be the bad cop.

You know the NDP strategy. Trash Jason Kenney and trash him good. Make the United Conservative leader into a scary, shadowy character voters won’t go anywhere near.

You know, the kind of guy you might see on a Most Wanted poster in the old movies.

So the Notley NDP go back to the archives and dust off some material we already saw when it made the political rounds a few months ago.

It is a few seconds of video from about 20 years ago. The subject is something from 30 years ago.

Yes, 30 years ago. No statute of limitations here.

In the video clip going on social media and TV, the young Kenney talks about his days on campus in San Francisco and how he “helped to lead an ultimately successful initiative which led to a referendum which overturned the first gay spousal law in North America.”

Yes, back in those days, the majority in San Francisco were on the same side as Kenney.

The video plays on, ominous music in the background.

A voice says Kenney bragged about stopping dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in the hospital.

More from the voice, telling us Kenney has been campaigning against people’s rights his whole life.

The voice asks the NDP question in this election campaign. Is this a premier?

By the way, the United Conservative question in this campaign is: Are you better off than you were four years ago?

Anyway, we all know Kenney’s views have changed. Newshound mention this fact. Hoffman says he’s not showing remorse.

She says Kenney on the video is bragging and boasting in making his statement of 20 years ago. Hoffman adds same-sex couples were denied hospital visitation rights.

“I believe Jason Kenney is unfit to be premier,” says Hoffman. “That video speaks volumes to his character.”

She uses words like cruel and hateful and talks about his smile.

Hoffman says she’s not sure why Notley is not doing this hit.

“I know why it’s me, I don’t know why it’s not her,” says Hoffman, when pushed by the press for not answering the question.

The deputy premier says the NDP will be sharing more information about the United Conservative leader.

Meanwhile, yours truly became a teeny tiny part of this mud wrestling scene when NDP bigshot Jeremy Nolais takes to Twitter and says your humble scribbler has an election strategy.

Me? A strategy?

Nolais, a supposed heavy hitter in the NDP braintrust, says little old me is trying to suppress “an ever-growing scandal that calls into question our open elections and Jason Kenney’s willingness to calmly lie to the people of Alberta.”

Is this so-called scandal an ever-growing one? Pray tell, what is the smoking gun? That Kenney’s people and supporters of a guy named Jeff Callaway sometimes worked together in the United Conservative leadership race.

That won’t be the decider at the ballot box for most folks. Unless more stuff comes out, this dog won’t hunt.

Ah, it’s only Day Two.

This is a day where a ThinkHQ nosecount shows the NDP way behind in Calgary and everywhere else in the province but Edmonton.

This is a day where Kenney once again takes aim at the carbon tax the Notley NDP didn’t tell us about in the last ballot battle, four years ago.

Imagine that.

The UCP leader once again vows to fight Trudeau and goes after Notley for lecturing Albertans about taking the bus and walking.

“This from a premier driven around in a gas-guzzling SUV.”

This is a day where Notley has an event at a fabricating plant and when the president of the company is asked if he supports the NDP he says “a lot of Albertans are questioning who to vote for next.”

Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

And this is a day where the NDP criticize Kenney and then quote former Wildrose leader Brian Jean.

The NDP and Jean. Strange bedfellows, indeed.

Notley once again speaks of Kenney lying and cheating to become his party’s leader.

“You can rest assured we will be taking a good, long, hard look at Mr. Kenney’s record.”

Fill yer boots.

The online poll of 1,196 people conducted March 14 to 17 by ThinkHQ Public Affairs states that provincewide, Jason Kenney’s UCP has 49 per cent of decided support with the NDP second at 38 per cent, a gap that has narrowed by three points in the past month.

In Calgary, meanwhile, the UCP has 54 per cent support, while the NDP trails at 33 per cent.

While the NDP has an 18-point advantage in Edmonton, where they fared well in the 2015 election, the governing party is stuck with Calgary numbers they had four years ago, but with no vote split on the right, said ThinkHQ president Marc Henry.

“The math and geography is hard (for the NDP) . . . How do you make it up in 27 days where you’ve been in the last four years,” he said.

“They have to have a lopsided gain from the undecideds.”

That undecided vote stands at 22 per cent, which provides some flexibility, said Henry, but the danger for the NDP is that 50 per cent of those polled say the governing party has had a negative effect on their lives.

“When that’s double the opposite, that’s a problem,” he said.

And while the NDP has made gains in popularity, those have largely been in areas where they were already leading, which doesn’t help their seat count, said Henry.

“That makes your vote very inefficient,” he said.

He noted the tail end of the poll was conducted just as evidence was emerging suggesting collusion between UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign and that of one-time Wildrose party president Jeff Callaway.

Kenney continues to deny the Callaway campaign was run to benefit his own, but Henry said the impact of honesty in the campaign could still fall along partisan lines.

At her campaign launch in Calgary on Tuesday, Premier Rachel Notley was asked if she could overcome years of negative polling in a four-week campaign.

“Polls don’t decide elections, voters do,” she said.

She also defended her government’s record in helping the city during the economic doldrums, citing major infrastructure projects it has funded along with efforts at diversification, including $100 million for high-tech ventures.

But Henry said of 30 Calgary-area seats, there are probably only six the NDP has a chance of winning, “and the NDP isn’t leading in any of them.”

The governing party could be competitive in a few ridings in the province’s north and in Lethbridge, but the UCP generally has rural areas locked up, added Henry.

The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley is promising to spend $7 billion over 10 years on incentives for companies willing to build petrochemical and upgrading facilities in Alberta if she is re-elected.

The investment would nearly double the $3.6 billion in incentives already committed by Notley's government.

Campaigning on Wednesday, Notley said the additional investment would encourage $75 billion in investment and 70,000 jobs by 2030.

Notley made her announcement at Cessco, an Edmonton company building components for the petrochemical industry.

The component displayed at the news conference was headed to a $300-million gas-to-plastics plant being built near Fort Saskatchewan, which Notley said was aided by a $200-million royalty credit.

""We own the resources in this province and so it is on us to develop them,"" Notley said.

The NDP leader said her government's $1 billion in incentives over the last three years has triggered nearly $13 billion in new private sector investment.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 12 to eight per cent over four years, which he said would create 55,000 jobs.

Notley said this tax ""giveaway"" is ""in return for nothing.""

""His plan is phony, discredited, magical thinking,"" she said. ""Quite frankly, he's selling snake oil. He doesn't have a plan to help you. He will just make Alberta and Albertans more vulnerable to boom and busts in the long run.""

Both leading parties, Rachel Notley’s NDP and Jason Kenney’s UCP, have taken steps — and sometimes gigantic leaps — to immunize themselves from being painted as irresponsible economic extremists.

There are indeed stark differences between the economic plans of the NDP and the UCP, but both parties have moved to the middle in order to calm voters.

Of course, the NDP will shout out that the UCP is plotting to turn Alberta into a divided province of haves and have-nots. As the NDP’s throne speech warned: “For too long, governments in Alberta worked for political insiders, well-heeled special interests and the super rich … We cannot — we must not — allow two different Albertas to form: One for the wealthy and one for everyone else.”

The UCP will holler back about the NDP’s increased taxes, adoration of regulation and anti-pipeline history, which they say has led to a surge of unemployment and rising government debt. As Kenney has put it: “Our province is being damaged every day by an ideological government that takes its inspiration from the failed theories of socialism, by a resentment of success, a distrust of enterprise.”

But, in fact, both parties agree more than they disagree on a number of key economic issues, including areas of pronounced past disagreement, such as the necessity of supporting new pipeline construction, the government’s crucial role in economic diversification, and that the public sector should not be hit with massive cuts.

On the minimum wage issue, Kenney isn’t planning to slash the NDP’s increases, but keep the minimum wage at $15 per hour, save for cutting the youth minimum wage to $13 per hour (which provides a necessary incentive for employers to hire inexperienced workers).

The NDP were notoriously against the Northern Gateway pipeline project and wishy-washy on Keystone XL, but now the NDP take full credit for the Trudeau Liberals buying up Trans Mountain when the expansion project was about to fail due to activist obstructionism and judicial road blocks. Proclaimed the NDP throne speech: “Trans Mountain remains in play because we compelled the federal government to step up and buy it.”

The NDP has also moved to bolster the energy sector with a diversification plan, $3.5 billion on the table to encourage billions more in private sector investment in petrochemicals.

The old Klein conservatives famously preached they weren’t in the business of doing business, but Kenney offers at least conceptual support for the NDP’s plan, so long as the government is investing in viable businesses with a high percentage of private capital.

When I recently asked Kenney about this issue, his words echoed many NDP statements. “We’re not opposed to the royalty tax credit incentive for petrochemical development per se. We want to look at each decision on its own merits. We agree that there is tremendous potential for more value added, leveraging our super cheap natural gas feed stock. When it comes to attracting investments like this, we are competing with other jurisdictions that do offer tax incentives, U.S. gulf states that will offer packages like no property tax, no corporate tax, et cetera for a certain number of years.”

Even on the issue of government debt, Kenney takes a more moderate approach than previous right-wing Alberta governments.

The UCP fiscal program will avoid large cuts, Kenney said, with plans to hold spending at current levels and control it partly through staff attrition. “There’s a certain anxiety about what happened back in 1993. We do not have to do that if we grow the economy and have a period of sustained fiscal responsibility.”

Of course, there are also major differences. The UCP promises to axe the NDP’s carbon tax. The UCP also promises to chop corporate taxes to eight per cent from 12 per cent, predicting this will supercharge the economy.

As for the NDP’s job growth plan, in the throne speech they focused on the “government’s efforts” to create jobs, talking up provincial spending on education, schools, hospitals, medical labs, public infrastructure, and seniors and social housing, before finally mentioning the NDP’s work on lobbying for the Trans Mountain expansion and investing in petrochemicals.

Of course, no loyalist conservative is going to suddenly believe Notley is doing enough on the pipeline file. No longtime socialist is going to buy for a moment that Kenney will be anything but anti-labour and anti-public sector spending.

But folks in the middle will notice moderation here, an attempt to answer for mistakes and excesses of the past. Wherever we’re headed, it’s to neither extreme edge of the economic spectrum.

The NDP issued a news release in which they deemed the provincial budget “off-balance and out of touch.”

“According to the Saskatchewan NDP, today’s provincial budget fails to live up to its only promise: balance,” they stated. “Meanwhile, it has nothing to offer the majority of Saskatchewan people, who are struggling, and leaves Saskatchewan students, families and seniors paying the price for the government’s cuts.”

Opposition leader Ryan Meili pointed to the growth of the province’s debt by $1.8 million and noted that the debt had tripled over the previous decade.

“Far too many people are paying far too much so this government can pat themselves on the back with false celebrations of balance,” said Meili in a news release.

In his response, Finance Critic Trent Wotherspoon said there was nothing in the budget for the majority of Saskatchewan people.

“They’ve tripled the debt, doubled the PST, flattened the economy, and left students without the supports they need,” Wotherspoon said in a statement.

“There’s nothing here for working families who are, frankly, more worried about balancing their own budgets than the province’s,” he stated. “There is nothing here for children, nothing for young people and families, nothing for seniors, nothing for people who are worried about losing their job, nothing for the North, and nothing for First Nations and Métis people.

As the saying goes, however, one week is a long time in politics, never mind four weeks, so anything could happen.

Nevertheless, UCP Leader Jason Kenney has long vowed that Bill 1 of his government would be to repeal the NDP government’s carbon tax — or as he calls it, the “tax on everything.”

Just how much of an effect will getting rid of the carbon tax have on struggling families and businesses?

My family’s latest bill — dated March 4 — shows that between Jan. 24 and Feb. 22 we used $69.53 worth of natural gas. The carbon levy cost an additional $54.79 — a whopping 78.8 per cent of the cost of the gas we used. Once all of the fees — delivery charges, rate riders, municipal franchise fee, GST and other costs — were added up, the bill came to $231.28. In other words, the carbon tax made up almost one-quarter of the cost of my entire bill — or 23.69 per cent, to be exact.

It was very cold in Calgary during that billing time, but these percentages of the cost of the carbon tax on our bill is not unusual. While this tax does not represent a huge hardship for me and my family, it does for many Albertans.

For 84-year-old widow Edith (who has asked that her last name not be used since she lives alone), the carbon tax has been hard, even though she keeps her bungalow near the University of Calgary “cooler than is always comfortable” most of the time.

“For me, getting rid of the carbon tax will be a godsend,” says Edith. “More government spending on programs doesn’t help me. What I really need is for the government to leave just a bit more of my own money in my own pocket,” said the healthy great-grandmother, who is originally from small-town Saskatchewan. She says she’ll be voting UCP on April 10 when the advance polls open.

On Wednesday, Kenney was campaigning in Lethbridge talking to the Sailer brothers, who took him on a tour of their 40-year-old family business, Southland Trailers.

Jason Sailer, 34, says the carbon tax costs their company around $7,000 a month.

“We have a couple of paint booths that use a lot of natural gas to dry the paint,” said Sailer.

“We believe in reinvesting money in our business for new equipment and to hire new people, and (the carbon tax) is just one more thing taking away from that pot,” said the 34-year-old father of a two-year-old boy.

Hiring more people means more money flowing into government coffers and more money for hospitals and education. And these aren’t minimum-wage jobs. Southland Trailer’s 180 employees make anywhere from about $18 to $38 per hour.

“We’re going to try to continue to expand as long as there’s demand for our products,” said Sailer. “Most of our competitors are out of the U.S, so the more competitive we can be the more we can expand and the more people we can hire.”

The NDP argues that getting rid of the tax will mean less revenue for government coffers, but many economists say lowering costs for businesses means more people working, more taxes and more government revenues.

“They just told me that the UCP’s Job Creation Tax Cut would also help them invest in expansion and hiring more members of their team; and that our Red Tape Reduction Action Plan and Open for Business Act will be a big help, too,” Kenney wrote on his Facebook page.

Meanwhile, the NDP launched a Kenney attack ad based on a speech he gave 20 years ago.

While a ThinkHQ poll and an Ipsos poll were both conducted before news coverage of a large document dump confirming reports of the “kamikaze candidate” scandal swirling around the UCP for weeks, the numbers show those who plan to vote UCP are largely unmoved.

ThinkHQ president Marc Henry said party vote intentions have been pretty stable over the past 18 months despite several controversies over UCP riding races, and allegations that UCP leadership hopeful Jeff Callaway simply ran in the 2017 race as a “stalking horse” candidate to help criticize Kenney’s main leadership rival, Brian Jean, so Kenney could appear to remain above the fray.

The RCMP is also investigating allegations of improper campaign donations.

“Those scandals are meaningful to some voters but what they’re really interested in is jobs, pipelines and the economy, so the risk for the NDP is if all you do is talk about Jason Kenney and how terrible he is, in many respects you’re talking past voters,” he said.

Provincewide, the UCP have 49 per cent support and the NDP has 38 per cent, according to ThinkHQ. The poll puts the NDP ahead in Edmonton, with 52 per cent of the vote to the UCP’s 34 per cent. In every other region of the province, the UCP is leading by large numbers, including in Calgary where the UCP leads with 54 per cent to the NDP’s 33 per cent.

“There are some voters whose overriding objective of the campaign is to get rid of the NDP. Almost half of Alberta voters say the NDP government has had a negative impact on their lives personally, and that’s a dangerous number because that’s as basic a ballot question as you can have,” said Henry.

According to the Ipsos poll, the race in Edmonton is at a statistical tie — 44 per cent NDP vs. 43 per cent UCP. In Calgary, the UCP has a sizable lead of 57 per cent versus 32 per cent for the NDP.

In short, voters will be asked to choose between a murky scandal involving internal party politics, or the scandal of the carbon tax that the NDP never campaigned on and that has hurt so many people and businesses.

It’s the same with the provincial election. I’ll be glad when it’s over, so we can all stop pretending the NDP have a path to re-election.

Is it possible the NDP could pull out a surprise victory on April 16? Yeah, I suppose it’s possible.

But the site SportsClubStats.com pegs the Oil’s postseason chances at just 1.3 per cent, even if they go 7-2-0 in their final nine games. And I think the NDP’s chances of repeating as government are lower than that.

Just look at the numbers.

There are 87 seats in the Alberta legislature, which means 44 are needed to form a majority government.

There are 25 seats in the Edmonton region and 24 in the city of Calgary. The rest of the province has 38.

In the last election, the NDP won all the Edmonton seats and 15 of the Calgary ones. They also swept Lethbridge and Red Deer. That gave Rachel Notley and her candidates 44 (a majority) to start with. They only won 10 more in all the rest of Alberta, but they didn’t need that many.

However, this time, the NDP will be unable to repeat that.

They will lose all the Edmonton suburbs. And I will be shocked if they hold on to more than two seats in Calgary.

Indeed, there is a greater chance they will be wiped out completely in Calgary than win even two seats there. There is no appetite for one single day more of NDP rule in the hollowed-out office towers, empty restaurants and half-full corporate parking lots in Calgary.

So with suburban Edmonton seats such as Sherwood Park, Spruce Grove and Leduc (there are six in total) plus at least 22 Calgary seats, the UCP would already be at 28 seats before we even get to the 38 “rural” seats.

To get a majority, the UCP would need to win only 16 of those 38 — and they will win at least 30, and more likely 35 or more. (From inside the bubble of Edmonton, it’s hard to fathom just how unpopular the NDP are everywhere else in the province.)

That means, even before votes are counted in Edmonton, the UCP should have a majority sewn up.

Couldn’t the Alberta Party split the anti-NDP vote with the UCP, especially with the UCP’s leadership controversy? Wouldn’t that permit either a few New Democrats to sneak up the middle or maybe allow Stephen Mandel and his party to win a surprising number of seats?

I don’t think so — except maybe in Edmonton.

Outside Edmonton (even only as far outside as Nisku and Namao), the first priority of voters will be to get rid of the NDP. Any controversy or party that gets in the way of that goal will be pushed aside.

Besides, outside Edmonton, if the Alberta Party splits the vote with anyone, it will be with the NDP, not the UCP. Alberta Party voters are largely old Redford Tories who voted NDP in 2015 because they were fed up with their own party but couldn’t stomach a conservative alternative (Wildrose). If they won’t vote NDP again this time, yet can’t bring themselves to return to the right (UCP), they will be a loss for the Notley party, not the UCP.

In Edmonton, there might be enough voters who cannot vote either NDP or UCP to hand the Alberta Party a few seats. But if that happens, they will simply be battling with the NDP over who gets to finish a distant second.",GUNTER: Let's stop pretending the NDP can win another provincial election,Edmonton Sun,https://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-lets-stop-pretending-the-ndp-can-win-another-provincial-election

“Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson pans speculation tax at West Vancouver yacht club chat,” reported the North Shore News Thursday atop a report on his speech to the local chamber of commerce.

An Opposition leader who the populist-led New Democrats have framed as an elitist. Who played into the stereotype with a comment on the “wacky fun” of renting, which he later had to repudiate.

Now he chooses to deliver a speech on the admittedly half-baked speculation tax at the yacht club in West Vancouver of all places?

“Surprisingly, this isn’t satire written by me,” wrote Jeffrey Ferrier, a self-styled “progressive” and one of several who posted the story on Twitter.

“Wow,” returned Global TV correspondent Keith Baldrey, himself a columnist in the North Shore News. “Does no one do advance work for the Libs any more? A yacht club — especially the West Van one — is the last place a politician with an elitist image problem should go anywhere near.”

Stung, members of the Opposition caucus rode to Wilkinson’s defence.

“But this was a local chamber of commerce event,” protested former cabinet minister Rich Coleman. “When my chamber invites me I don’t tell them where to hold it. It is important to respect local volunteer groups, it is their decision.”

“Come on, Keith,” tweeted Michelle Stilwell, another former cabinet minister. “Why not focus on the issue of a half-baked speculation tax that doesn’t actually target speculators but makes 1.4 million British Columbians prove themselves otherwise?”

Picking up on the what-about-ism theme was former minister Shirley Bond: “How about when John Horgan calls (Liberal MLA) Jackie Tegart a ‘whiner’ for representing constituents and a bill introduced by (Liberal) Stephanie Cadieux is a ‘political stunt’? No comment???”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the latest in the SNC-Lavalin affair, as well as challenges facing Education Minister Rob Fleming on Surrey school portables and Vancouver school closures, as well as the future of the NDP minority government now that it has survived confidence votes on the throne speech and budget.

But as experienced politicians know — or should know — telling a reporter that he/she should be writing about something other than what he/she is writing about is not a proven media management strategy.

“The physical location/backdrop of a political leader’s appearance during an election campaign is chosen with deliberate, strategic care,” wrote Baldrey by way of reply to several Liberals. “That’s because they matter when it comes to shaping messages and image.”

Yet from this case and others, it would appear the Liberals can’t be bothered with optics, making it easier for opponents to define Wilkinson.

Before long, the exchange veered into ridicule.

When I wrote of the Liberals that “they do protest too much,” someone tweeted back: “I believe in West Vancouver it’s pronounced ‘doth.’”

Also riffing on the Liberal gaffe was one who posted a video of Thurston Howell III, the parody billionaire played by Jim Backus on the old Gilligan’s Island TV show.

The New Democrats played it for laughs as well.

“B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson sailed into the West Vancouver Yacht Club yesterday to say ahoy to about two-dozen members of the exclusive group,” read the press release from a government caucus that is still more quick-witted at the job of opposing than the official Opposition.

And so on, through Wilkinson “tying himself into knots” and “his priority is to buoy the richest two per cent and leave everyone else lost at sea,” and “instead of throwing people a lifeline, Wilkinson is making them walk the plank.”

Great fun unless you happen to be on the Wilkinson defence team.

Reaching, someone in Liberal ranks noticed that attorney general David Eby had spoken at the “ritzy” Vancouver Club, and wasn’t that the same thing?

Plus there was this, from Opposition house leader Mary Polak: “Someone should advise Horgan not to speak at the B.C. Fed convention.”

Both missed the point.

Getting cozy with the Vancouver Club is not one of the unfortunate stereotypes associated with Eby. That appearance by the wealth-taxing, lawyer-bashing attorney general was more of a case of a politician venturing into the lion’s den.

And the annual convention of the 500,000-member B.C. Federation of Labour is a somewhat more broadly based venue than the West Van yacht club, whomever is hosting.

A more apt comparison would be to Environment Minister George Heyman’s attendance at a celebratory dinner with anti-pipeline activists last January, just after he announced B.C. would restrict shipments of heavy oil from Alberta.

Not only did his government have to pull back the threat, but reporting on the appearance helped put Heyman in the activist camp himself.

Or consider how the story was played when Adrian Dix, who’d admitted forging a memo in the casino scandal, was caught without a ticket on SkyTrain.

As for Horgan, one of his vulnerabilities is a quick temper. Though he’s kept it in check lately, he made the news more than once when he lost it during his days in Opposition.

Every leader has weaknesses, some more unfortunate than others. A key political art is to turn one’s weaknesses into strengths, or failing that, to avoid reinforcing the stereotype.

Wilkinson knows very well that the NDP will indulge the class warfare theme every chance it gets.

“It’s a good way to generate stories about people who are deemed to be well off and how they are going to be kicked around a bit,” he told the chamber crowd. “That’s good politics for the NDP.”

Kicking Wilkinson around is even better politics for the New Democrats. Once more this week, he played right into their hands.

Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement:

Tonight at sundown, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will celebrate the beginning of Purim.

Purim is a celebration of the strength of the human spirit and the will to survive in the face of unspeakable oppression. It is a time to commemorate the escape of the Jewish people from persecution in the ancient Persian Empire.

Purim is also a joyous occasion bringing families and friends together to share meals, make noise, and show compassion and charity to those who are less fortunate.

As we read the Megillah, and reflect on the bravery of Queen Esther and her uncle Mordecai, we are reminded of the triumph of hope, love, and courage over hate.

On this day, I invite everyone to reflect on the story of Purim, honour the contributions of Jewish Canadians to Canada, celebrate the diversity and resilience of our communities, and commit to building a world free from anti-Semitism, discrimination, and hatred in all its forms.

Last week two financial institutions released economic analyses that both zeroed in on B.C.’s economy, and both projected it will slow down significantly because of the cooling of the province’s real estate market.

Central 1 Credit Union concluded the province’s economy will, in fact, have three years of weak economic growth after several years of robust annual growth of more than three per cent GDP.

Its deputy chief economist, Bryan Yu, said in a news release “economic growth is being held hostage by the housing market slump, which is deeper than previously forecast.”

As a result, Central 1 is now forecasting the provincial economy will grow by just 2.2 per cent in the coming year, then 2.4 per cent in 2020 and 2.8 per cent in 2021.

Yu’s report predicted “a substantial rebound [in home sales] is not expected. This downturn will be modest compared to previous episodes, reflecting a policy-induced downturn, rather than economic-recession induced downturn.”

Meanwhile, TD Economics had a more pessimistic assessment, projecting B.C.’s economic growth to be just 1.4 per cent this year and two per cent next year. Again, the chief villain is the slumping real estate sector.

“B.C.’s deepening housing market slowdown is likely to put a larger damper on growth this year,” it said in its provincial economic forecast. “The province’s housing market has been the most hard-hit by the implementation of tighter rules, rising interest rates and B.C. government policy measures.”

To be sure, neither of these projected scenarios constitute being anything close to a recession, but this may still spell bad news for the government’s three-year fiscal plan. The lower the economic growth rate, the fewer tax dollars are available for collection, and that plan projects an increase of almost $4.5 billion in tax revenue over that period.

To her credit, Finance Minister Carole James has taken a prudent approach to financial planning, and I have noted in this space before that she has built into her budgets enough elbow room to withstand some poorer-than-expected revenue estimates.

Still, what’s disappointing about this situation is that measures such as the speculation tax, the increase in the foreign buyers tax and the higher tax on high-end homes was supposed to make housing – both at the ownership and tenancy level – more affordable.

Instead, for now anyway, while house prices have dropped they have not dropped to the point of making homes actually affordable for most folks.

A house that drops in price from $3 million to $2 million can hardly be viewed as becoming suddenly affordable.

And rents haven’t declined much either and remain unattainable for many. So it now looks like the government’s housing policies (which do not place much emphasis on increasing the supply of housing) are not only not meeting the affordability targets, but are instead having the biggest impact at slowing down the provincial economy.

Now, none of this may come back to haunt the NDP government. Both financial institutions are predicting employment levels will remain high (the government’s infrastructure program is considered to be providing a cushion to any economic slowdown).

As well, TD Economics predicts B.C. finances will still lead the country and points out the massive LNG Canada project will provide a boost to economic growth to partially offset the slumping housing sector. And Central 1’s Yu says continued “moderate population growth” will also help.

As well, the B.C. Liberals continue to struggle to find their identity as an Opposition party and party leader Andrew Wilkinson has had a bad run of foot-in-mouth-itis in recent days.

At times, the B.C. Liberals continue to come across as a frustrated group that still cannot accept they are not in charge of running things anymore. However, the economic storm clouds are indeed gathering. After experiencing relatively sunny days during their first 20 months in office, things may be about to get a little darker for the NDP government.

The Canadian Press





A Winnipeg School Division trustee who has been in a war of words with Manitoba's Progressive Conservative government is planning to run for the Opposition New Democrats.

Mark Wasyliw has told the Winnipeg Labour Council he will seek the NDP nomination in the Fort Garry seat in Winnipeg.

Wasyliw says he expects as many as three other trustees from Winnipeg-area school divisions, who were endorsed by the council as trustee candidates, will seek NDP nominations.

Wasyliw has criticized the Tory government on several issues, including a recent move by the province to cap school property tax increases at two per cent.

A young woman ducked into her room after the final bell ...","VICTORIA — Annie Ohana was in her classroom at L.A. Matheson high school in Surrey last week, when an all-too-common scene played out. A young woman ducked into her room after the final bell rang and quietly asked: “Ms. Ohana, do you have a tampon or pad?”

“Teachers at schools and counsellors, especially as women, we do often keep a little stash of products,” said Ohana.

So Ohana, the Aboriginal department head at the school, gladly reached into her own supply to help out. It made the difference between the student being able to stay at school for her extracurricular activities, or having to leave.

“She was volunteering for something, but instead of going home because of her period, she was able to ask me,” said Ohana. “I was able to provide it, but that’s my own money … the system should provide it. In this case I was there, but what if I was gone?”

It’s a question increasingly being asked by teachers, parents, students and advocates in hundreds of schools across the province. Why is there no provincial funding to provide free tampons and pads for female students in school washrooms?

Instead, B.C. has a patchwork system that varies from school to school and often results in embarrassment and shame for female students.

Some districts put coin-operated dispensers in women’s bathrooms (requiring girls to have exact change to get a pad or tampon while bleeding and in need). Others schools have literally nothing. In some cases, like in Burnaby North Secondary, students have taken it upon themselves to organize free baskets of products in washrooms because nobody else will do it for them.

Some schools do offer free tampons or pads — but only if the student interrupts her teacher in class, asks to be excused in front of all her classmates, walks to the office, waits in the queue at the front desk and then asks the (possibly male) receptionist in front of everyone else sitting in that office if she can please have a tampon thank-you-very-much. You couldn’t create a more cumbersome and humiliating system if you tried.

Some girls can’t afford to buy their own products. And there’s cultural and social stigmas around menstruation that can leave young women, at a difficult time in their life, isolated from family and friends. It’s even more difficult if the student is transgender. The very least the education system could do is offer them a discreet, free, and easy way to get a tampon or pad from every school washroom, without having to ask.

One in seven Canadian girls have missed school because they couldn’t get a tampon or pad during their period, according to a Procter & Gamble survey.

The issue was raised at the legislature by Green Leader Andrew Weaver during International Women’s Day. He based his question on a suggestion from one of his staff members, Stephanie Siddon.

Education Minister Rob Fleming responded by pointing to community grant programs that schools could try to tap, while offering to conduct more research into the issue.

It was an unimpressive display of leadership, said Weaver.

“There are some things that you just think about for 30 seconds and you realize, yeah that just makes sense,” said Weaver. “Here we are in 2019. You just do it. This falls into that. … “I would have thought he’d just have done it.”

Weaver’s own quick calculations — done in the middle of an interview using public pricing for hygiene products — pegged the rough cost at $200,000 a month for the education system, or $2.4 million a year to give more than 260,000 enrolled female students access to tampons and pads.

That amounts to a “rounding error” in the ministry’s $6.5-billion annual budget that should be acted upon without wasting time researching further, said Weaver.

New Westminster became one of the first school districts in Canada to fully fund feminine hygiene products when it voted last month to spend $10,000 of its own operating budget on dispensers and $7,000 annually to stock them with free supplies for women.

The issue is also on agendas for school trustees in Surrey, Greater Victoria, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Burnaby and Vancouver.

School districts are charging forward on their own, while the province lags behind.

The government could save time and effort by simply listening to advocates like Douglas College professor Selina Tribe, who has been clear, consistent and vocal about the issue for months.

Or Sussanne Skidmore, the secretary-treasurer of the B.C. Federation of Labour who is helping lead the United Way’s Period Promise campaign that sent a letter to Fleming on March 7 asking him to “take a leadership role in addressing period poverty in our province.”

“If there’s public policy around this, we can normalize it and make it no different than toilet paper,” Skidmore said. “It’s a human right.”

How frustrating it must be for socially progressive New Democrats to watch their government move so slowly on a clear-cut human rights issue like this.

“There are lots of leaders stepping up to say it can be done and it’s not that complicated,” said Skidmore.

Social Development Minister Shane Simpson is set to announce B.C.’s new poverty reduction strategy on Monday. There’s no good reason why this couldn’t be included.

Fleming said in statements last week that he’s “committed to supporting students around the province who need access to these products and I look forward to putting forward a plan soon.”

In the meantime, he said, “ministry staff are currently researching this further.”

Researching what exactly?

Is there some sort of cost-benefit ratio needed before the minister will sign off on funding access to hygiene products?

Is there a price to be put on the embarrassment faced in having to ask the office receptionist or school nurse (if the nursing office hasn’t already been eliminated due to cutbacks) for a tampon?

Is there a figure we can apply to how many days it’s acceptable for a female student to go home sick because they get their period in class and have nowhere to turn?

Does the ministry research the cost of toilet paper or soap?

For Ohana, who teaches social justice to her high school students, the issue is clear.

“To me, this is tied in to social justice,” she said. “At the end of the day, it’s a human right. It’s a human reality.

“There’s a shame element,” Ohana added. “If girls can feel they can be proud of their bodies, and part of that being menstruation, that’s going to impact their self-esteem and confidence.”

That’s worth the cost.

Free advice to the education minister: Just do it.

Ms. Hughes recounted issues and projects that she has worked on noting that in some instances MPs on the government benches were forced into silence for fear of embarrassing their parties. She also criticized the government for failing to deliver on their promises.

“Whether it was the bold proclamations on electoral reform that amounted to nothing, the glacier-like pace of action on climate change that has only divided the country due to a lack of real leadership and inconsistent action, or the realization that corporate influence remains more important than the needs and concerns of hard-working Canadians; this government said a lot of nice things when they were trying to get elected, but Canadians will judge them on their actions not their sentiments,” said Ms. Hughes in a press release.

The press release also highlighted the important proposals New Democrats have brought to Parliament and will continue to fight for including a universal single-payer pharmacare system, cracking down on tax cheats who increase the burden on everyone who plays by the rules, funding First Nations communities for critical things like education and safe drinking water, addressing the growing housing shortage that is affecting our children when they want to buy their first home, or—most importantly—ensuring future generations have a livable environment.

Ms. Hughes said things haven’t changed much despite the change in government when it comes to the influence of powerful lobbyists.

Chief Robert Chamberlin is best known to progressive British Columbians as a defender of wild salmon and an outspoken critic of open-net fish farms and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

As the vice president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, he's also been involved in a range of other issues, ranging from land use to the treatment of children in government care.

But there's a chance that he could become a member of Parliament—and the third Indigenous person from B.C. to have a seat in the House of Commons.

Today, Chamberlin announced that he's seeking the NDP nomination in Nanaimo-Ladysmith. The seat was vacated by New Democrat Sheila Malcolmson when she launched a successful campaign in the Nanaimo provincial by-election.

Chamberlin has been the elected chief of the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa'mis First Nation since 2005.

""There are the issues people in this riding care about—building more affordable homes, being able to pay for the prescription drugs you need, having child care you can access and afford,"" Chamberlin said in a news release. ""But it's not going to happen when Mr. Trudeau only listens to the lobbyists and corporate executives who come knocking at his Ottawa door.""

On March 6, NDP Indigenous relations and reconciliation critic Sol Mamakwa introduced a private member’s bill — Bill 76 — which calls for laws in Ontario to be in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On Thursday, the bill will go to second reading. If it passes, it will then head to committee. (Like the vast majority of private member’s bills, however, Bill 76 is very unlikely to pass.)



“There are numerous, needless deaths and unnecessary suffering happening in our communities that would not be acceptable anywhere in Ontario — or in Canada, for that matter,” Mamakwa says. “In the house, I always ask why they treat our people differently. That’s what this is; it’s a test for the government.” (The government did not provide comment on Bill 76 when asked by TVO.org.)



UNDRIP outlines the “minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the Indigenous peoples,” focusing on such issues as the right to self-determination and prior and informed consent on matters related to Indigenous and treaty rights.

When UNDRIP was first adopted by the UN in 2007, Stephen Harper’s federal government praised it as an “aspirational document” but nonetheless voted against it. Justin Trudeau campaigned in support of it, and his government removed Canada’s objector status in 2016. But, two months later, then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould called it “unworkable” and a “political distraction to undertaking the hard work actually required to implement it back home in communities.”



Without guidance from the federal government, provinces have been left to determine their own course. British Columbia recently committed to formally legislating UNDRIP. In Ontario, many Indigenous people are skeptical of the government’s commitment to Indigenous issues. Since the June election, the Progressive Conservative government has slashed the Indigenous Culture Fund, reneged on a previous commitment to introduce Indigenous-focused curriculum updates, and merged the formerly independent Indigenous affairs cabinet portfolio with energy, northern development, and mines.



TVO.org spoke with three Indigenous experts about the importance of the bill, its chances of becoming law, and the impact its success or failure in the house would have on the relationship between Indigenous people and the province.

Scott Robertson, a lawyer and the president of the Indigenous Bar Association, hopes that the government will pass Bill 76, but he isn’t confident that will happen.



“The government of Ontario would have to take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Ontario are consistent with UNDRIP,” says Robertson. “I’m not getting the cozy feeling from Premier Ford that he would be interested in taking on that initiative or the responsibility.”



For one thing, there’s the issue of feasibility. Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act says that the federal government has authority over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians.” Robertson says that, while the province may indicate that it would be able to satisfy many of these requirements, they ultimately could fall under the federal government’s jurisdiction.



Specific sections, such as Article 19, could also prove problematic, he notes. Article 19 states that the Crown must “obtain [Indigenous peoples] free, prior and informed consent” on anything that affects Indigenous and treaty rights — and that could transfer a huge amount of power from the province to Indigenous people.



In situations involving resource extraction, for example, “You’d actually have to get the Indigenous group to say, ‘Yes, we approve,’” says Robertson. “Not just the consultation of showing up to a board meeting, giving some notes, some papers, and saying, ‘This is what our project will be like — hope you like it.’”



Robertson notes that, if Bill 76 fails to pass, Indigenous and treaty rights will remain protected by Section 35 of the Constitution Act (1982). “Indigenous rights are enshrined in Section 35, which is a lot more comforting than an UNDRIP document,” he says.



But, Robertson says, if the government rejects this bill, it will be signalling that it doesn’t want to help Indigenous people: “They want to create a system whereby it becomes so intolerable, [Indigenous people have to] leave the reserve and give up the rights to their land.”



Lindsay (Swooping Hawk) Kretchmer



Lindsay (Swooping Hawk) Kretchmer says that Ontario should support UNDRIP in part because of the size of the province’s Indigenous population. “Stats Canada data from 2016 put Ontario as number one in the country for overall Indigenous population,” she says. “The time to take stock of these realities is now — the bill may have implications, but doing nothing has far greater consequences.”



Kretchmer, the executive director of the Toronto Aboriginal Support Services Council and a former Indigenous affairs consultant with the city, says that if Bill 76 were to pass, it would transform current policymaking, creating a legal framework for Indigenous self-determination.



“UNDRIP would be used as the underpinnings of new laws to redress historical injustices in a manner that eradicates our contemporary challenges, allowing us to build our own path forward parallel to that of our Canadian friends,” says Kretchmer.



But she’s not optimistic about the bill’s chances, believing that it will fail “due to a longstanding, uninformed opinion on Indigenous people that evokes fear among decision-makers that we just might get one step too close to actually regaining more than a Section 35 mention.”



She is glad, though, that, at the very least, the bill will force the government to take a firm position. “It puts the current leadership in a position to make a clear choice on where they stand with Indigenous rights-based issues.”



Aylan Couchie



On February 23, artist and writer Aylan Couchie published an open letter to Doug Ford, addressing cuts to the Indigenous Culture Fund (ICF), which was created by the Liberals in 2017 to support Indigenous communities, culture, and ways of life through community-based work. “We are concerned the Ontario PC government does not realize what it is they have cut and, we fear, are looking to completely dismantle,” she wrote.



Couchie sees programs such as those funded by the ICF as critical to reconciliation because of the community work they support — language revitalization, traditional harvesting, food security — and points to Bill 76 as one way to protect them.



She believes that cuts to the ICF are counter to the spirit of UNDRIP. “ICF can be seen as Ontario’s commitment to upholding the declaration,” says Couchie. “It covers 14 different Articles, like Article 8 — how we have the right to not be ‘subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of culture.’”

If Bill 76 isn’t passed, she fears that the government will continue to roll back Indigenous funding.



“[Bill 76] is going to impact too many ministries, and Doug Ford won’t be able to make the cuts that he’s making right now,” says Couchie. “It’s not conducive to [the PCs’] end goal.”



She does, however, think that Mamakwa’s move to present Bill 76 was a smart one, regardless of the outcome. “I think the bill is mostly just to show exactly where Ford lies,” Couchie says. “I don’t think it ever had a hope in hell, and I don’t think Sol thought it had a hope in hell. I think it’s just to highlight that the government is not going to be working with Indigenous people or for Indigenous people.”

In the wake of the Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque shootings that claimed the lives of 50 people at prayer, Monday’s session at the Saskatchewan legislative assembly began with a member’s statement from Opposition Leader Ryan Meili condemning the attack and similar violence.

This became the dominant theme throughout question period.

Rural and Remote Health Minister Greg Ottenbriet and Highways Minister Lori Carr previously attended yellow vest rallies in their home communities of Yorkton and Estevan, respectively.

Meili asked if Premier Scott Moe still thought it was “no big deal” the ministers attended the rallies, given the anti-immigrant and Islamophobic connotations associated with yellow vests.

“I, we as the government of Saskatchewan condemn violence against any community no matter their faith or creed,” Moe said on the assembly floor.

Moe acknowledged Ottenbreit and Carr attended the rallies, but in opposition to energy policies like the carbon tax and Bill C-69.

When pressed on the group’s association anti-immigrant, Islamaphobic, and comments calling for violence against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Moe said the group can’t be painted with a broad brush.

“We should not paint all of these people with the same brush. Many of these individuals at these protests are voicing their concerns with respect to their job, and some of the headwinds these industries are taking,” Moe said.

“We should in no way paint all these individuals with the same brush due to comments by a few individuals in any area.”

Meili said you can’t separate the yellow vests from “rampant” comments online spreading anti-immigrant sentiment.

“At every one of their protests you see this anti-U.N. Migration Compact, which is just anti-immigration language. You see threats or violence or proposing violence against the Prime Minister. You see online, all the time, anti-Islam language,” Meili said.

“That’s the kind of folks that are attracted to the yellow vest movement. That’s the way that those views have been given space, and for the premier to be unwilling to distance himself from those events is irresponsible and really downright gross.”

Both Moe and Meili attended a pro-resource rally in January hosted by pro-oil and gas activists Canada Action. The event’s organizers banned yellow vests due to associations with the aforementioned outside elements. Moe spoke at the event, Meili was in the crowd.

When Moe was asked about posts on Facebook groups like Yellow Vests Canada, which often deal with anti-U.N., anti-globalist, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslimism posts, Moe said he had not visited the site or seemed to be aware of them.

“That’s a Facebook issue. We would ask them to take those types of comments down,” Moe said.

“There's comments here today that I'm learning about that most certainly this government would not be supportive of with respect to immigration or immigrants; people that have come here from other areas - nor have we ever been,” Moe said.

The premier reiterated that his government condemns racist thoughts, actions and the “senseless” killings in New Zealand.

Meili said the presence of ministers at rallies associated with far-right extremism normalizes the viewpoints.

“This is getting momentum and it's absolutely the responsibility of Scott Moe, of Andrew Scheer or anyone who's been flirting with any of these movements to shut it down and show leadership,” Meili said.

Meili added the NDP met with Ihsaan Gardee, executive director for the National Council of Canadian Muslims last week.

He said they discussed adopting Jan. 29 as a day of action against hate and intolerance.

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA - A new poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press suggests the governing federal Liberals have lost ground to the Conservatives over the past month.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled after the federal budget was released Tuesday said they would vote for Justin Trudeau's Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of about three percentage points from February.

That compared with 37 per cent who said they would back the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer, a one-point increase from February, while 12 per cent said they would vote NDP and eight per cent the Greens.

Scheer also jumped ahead of Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister as the Tory leader got the backing of 25 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau, who has been struggling to contain damage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As for the budget, which the Liberals are hoping will help turn the page on SNC-Lavalin, 12 per cent of respondents said it was good and 19 per cent that it was bad, but 39 per cent said they didn't really know about it.

Leger's internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology and heard from 1,529 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm's online panel.",New Leger poll suggests federal Liberals lagging Conservatives,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/new-leger-poll-suggests-federal-liberals-lagging-conservatives-1.4345939

The budget states: “To facilitate internal trade, the Government intends to remove the federal requirement that alcohol moving from one province to another be sold or consigned to a provincial liquor authority. Provinces and territories would continue to be able to regulate the sale and distribution of alcohol within their boundaries.”

Derek From, staff lawyer at the Canadian Constitution Foundation, tells CTVNews.ca that although “the devil is in the details” the proposal “sounds very promising.”

At present, the prohibition-era Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act states that liquor can’t cross provincial boundaries “except such as has been purchased by or on behalf of, and that is consigned to Her Majesty or the executive government of, the province into which it is being imported.”

This is likely the law the Liberals are planning to change, according to From.

“Best case scenario is a restaurant in downtown Toronto that wants to have access to a really nice wine in B.C., but it’s not on the shelf in any of the stores in Ontario” will be able to “just get online and order it and have it directly shipped to them,” he said.

Dan Paszkowski, president of the Canadian Vintners Association, says he believes the Liberals intend to let consumers order wines from other provinces directly to their homes, rather than going through a provincial government agency like Ontario’s LCBO or Quebec’s SAQ.

“If you ordered a case of wine from British Columbia it (currently) would have to go through the LCBO,” he told CTV’s Power Play. “With this, you wouldn’t have to go through the LCBO -- and hopefully avoid the tax.”

From said he believes the case of Gerard Comeau, whom the CCF defended at the Supreme Court of Canada, brought the interprovincial trade barriers to the public’s attention.

Comeau was fined $292.40 in 2012 for transporting several cases of beer and some liquor into New Brunswick from Quebec. He fought the ticket all the way to the supreme court and lost. The court said that provinces have the right to incidentally burden free trade with laws that have other valid purposes like protecting health or safety.

From said the change would be a win for producers and consumers. “There’s no one who doesn’t benefit,” he said.","Federal budget suggests Liberals may help 'free the beer,' wine",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/federal-budget-suggests-liberals-may-help-free-the-beer-wine-1.4345021

The transition measures fall short of recommendations made by the former Canadian Forces ombudsman and, in some cases, those of the House of Commons veterans committee.","The Liberal government is pouring $135 million over six years into the system that attempts to smooth veterans' transition from uniforms to civilian life.

It's one of a series of relatively small measures for the veterans community contained in Finance Minister Bill Morneau's new budget — the Trudeau government's last fiscal plan before this year's election.

The transition measures fall short of recommendations made by the former Canadian Forces ombudsman and, in some cases, those of the House of Commons veterans committee.

Other initiatives in the budget include a $150 million, five-year survivors fund for veterans' spouses who married over the age of 60, and long-awaited recognition for Metis who fought in the Second World War.

Both of those plans appear to be aimed at key demographics the Liberals hope to capture in the fall election.

More significant, though, is the fact that the budget put money behind many of the transition initiatives announced last fall by Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and then-veterans minister Seamus O'Reagan.

Both the Department of National Defence and Veterans Affairs are focused on improving what has been described as a chaotic transition system — one which sometimes forces veterans to wait months for their military pensions, benefits and rehabilitation to kick in.

The budget contains a number of previously announced initiatives, including better training and a transition guide for retiring members.

What it doesn't contain is a specific reference to a personalized ""consigner service,"" which would shepherd soldiers, sailors and aircrew through the complicated system of forms, benefits and eligibility rules involved in retiring from the military.

That's something former ombudsman Gary Walbourne recommended. The federal government has promised already to turn it into a pilot program, but there's no mention of a pilot in the budget document.

Disability benefits backlog

The budget also is silent on how to resolve an enormous backlog of disability benefits applications, which was estimated at roughly 40,000 files last November.

Instead, the budget offered a series of new, relatively small initiatives to underscore what the Liberal government has done for veterans. Many veterans abandoned the Conservatives in the last election but have grown increasingly restless and disillusioned since.

Prominent among the previously-announced plans in the new budget is the upcoming implementation of the so-called pension-for-life plan — a major promise made by the Liberals in the last election.

The $3.6 billion investment was announced in the 2018 budget, with a rollout scheduled for April 1, 2019.

Among the new proposals is a $150 million, five-year survivor's fund for the spouses of veterans who married after age 60.

And as part of its reconciliation effort with the aboriginal community, Ottawa has set aside $30 million to recognize Metis veterans who fought for Canada in the Second World War.

That plan has been the subject of long, detailed negotiations with the Metis community, which has urged the federal government to move quickly because of the dwindling number of living former soldiers.",Liberals look to shore up veterans vote with transition cash,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/budget-2019-veterans-military-1.5063254

Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que.,","OTTAWA — A one-time $2.2-billion windfall in the federal budget to help Canadian cities improve roads, bridges, highways and water systems won't become an annual tradition, Finance Minister Bill Morneau warned Wednesday, even in the face of what he acknowledged were problems getting the original projects off the ground.

Tuesday's multibillion-dollar top-up will double the money cities receive through the federal gas-tax fund, which sends money directly to municipalities each year.

The spending blueprint says the Liberals have approved more than 33,000 projects worth about $19.9 billion in federal financing under new and existing infrastructure programs, but also acknowledges spending has been slower than anticipated, including ""some jurisdictions being slower to prioritize projects.""

Morneau called out four provinces on Tuesday in explaining the Liberals' decision to use the gas-tax fund to kickstart more projects, naming Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick — provinces with conservative-minded governments that don't always co-operate readily with the federal Liberals.

Topping up the fund was the appropriate response, Morneau said Wednesday at a post-budget event in Toronto.

""We haven't been able to do exactly what we expected and that was the reason for the municipal infrastructure top-up,"" he said.

""What you shouldn't do is take this as a conclusion on how we will go forward, but what it is, is an important way for us to move forward now in getting some projects that are stalled going.""

Federal infrastructure funding is regularly subject to delays because funds only flow once receipts are filed, which causes a lag between when work occurs and money is paid out.

An internal analysis of the Liberal program pointed to several issues to explain the pace of spending: too many low-value projects requiring the same detailed review as those much larger in size and delays in getting provincial and territorial project recommendations.

Elections in Ontario and New Brunswick last year paused provincial project approvals during the campaign. There are also delays in approvals when a new government is elected — as was the case in Ontario and New Brunswick — as new office holders learn their files and review government operations.

Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que., said the measures are a direct response to pleas from cities to modernize their relationship with Ottawa so they don't have to rely solely on the provinces.

Under the federal Liberal government's infrastructure program, federal spending will top $186 billion over the next decade.

How successful the plan has been to date is an area of contention between the Liberals and the parliamentary budget watchdog, who most recently questioned anew whether increases in federal spending have created the jobs promised by the government.

Other investments have, according to provinces, fallen short of what was required, particularly on rural broadband internet service. Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.

The Liberals created the bank in 2017 to take $35 billion in federal financing and use it to leverage three to four times that from the private sector to help pay for major highways, bridges, and water and electrical systems. To get private money involved, projects needed to produce revenue streams — tolls, for instance. Fees for internet service are already typical, but serving remote, sparsely populated areas with high-speed lines is a financial challenge.

On Tuesday, the Liberals added a new component to the Crown agency, earmarking $1 billion over 10 years for rural broadband, but mandating the bank find at least $2 billion more in private capital for the initiative. It was part of a plan to deliver up to $6 billion over a decade to connect everyone in the country to high-speed internet by 2030.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

On the season two finale of Political Blind Date, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant and Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus debate the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement. ( TVO )

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive. Conservatives want to change the agreement with the U.S. to allow Canada to send those claiming refugee status after crossing at irregular locations back to the U.S.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, while standing at the north side of Roxham Road, the Quebec location where the majority of border crossings have happened over the last two years for irregular asylum claimants.

The French-born Ephestion ""is grateful to finally call New Brunswick, Canada, home,"" says a news release from Jen Smith, his vice-president of communications.

Ephestion's citizenship is dependant on whether he passes the test, but Smith said she doesn't expect he'll have any problems with that or with his application to become a Liberal leadership candidate.

""We're very confident he's going to pass his test, and he will be a citizen on the 17th.""

Smith said Ephestion has resigned as director of Nazareth House, a shelter in Moncton, so he can devote his time to his leadership campaign.

The only other person who has expressed interest in succeeding former premier Brian Gallant as leader is Kevin Vickers, the former sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, who announced his candidacy for the leadership last week.

But the leadership race rules published by the Liberal Party on Feb. 7 require that candidates ""be eligible for election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in accordance with the Elections Act."" This means candidates must be citizens.

The deadline for candidates to submit their applications and nomination forms is March 29.

Ephestion could be disqualified from the Liberal leadership race because he is not yet a citizen. He has permanent resident status in Canada and applied for citizenship in September.

Keiller Zed, the executive director of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, said he wouldn't be able to comment specifically on Ephestion's application until it had gone through a vetting process.

The steering committee has five business days from the receipt of an application to review and approve or reject it.

Zed was able to confirm the association has received one candidate application already and expects to receive another one shortly.

He would not say who had already submitted forms, but a post to Ephestion's Facebook page from March 15 said his application was submitted that day, meaning the committee would have until this Friday to approve or reject it — provided it's properly completed.",Liberal leadership candidate gets date for citizenship test,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/ren%C3%A9-ephestion-citizenship-test-1.5064680?cmp=rss

But that comfort will be ...,"OTTAWA — Members of Parliament were bracing Wednesday for an all-night voting marathon as opposition parties protested the Trudeau government's efforts to shut down any further investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The Liberal majority shot down a Conservative motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to let former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould testify more fully about her allegation that she was improperly pressured to drop a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The motion was defeated by a vote of 161-134.

That set the stage for a Conservative-sponsored filibuster, requiring 257 separate votes on items in the government's spending estimates. The voting could theoretically last 36 hours, but the Conservatives have only to keep it going until just after 10 a.m. Thursday to scrub the remainder of the parliamentary day.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically considered a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force to avoid potential defeat of the government.

The filibuster started Wednesday evening — one day after Liberals on the House of Commons justice committee used their majority to pull the plug on their investigation into the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has already testified for nearly four hours before the committee, having been granted a waiver from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to freely discuss events from last fall — when the inappropriate pressure was allegedly applied — until Jan. 14, when she was shuffled out of the dual justice and attorney general post to Veterans Affairs.

The Conservative motion called on Trudeau to extend the waiver of cabinet confidentiality to cover the period from Jan. 14 to mid-February, when Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet.

Wilson-Raybould has said she has more to say about what occurred after she was shuffled, but she was not in the Commons for the vote on the Conservative motion. Nor was Jane Philpott, who resigned from cabinet in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould early this month, saying she'd lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

However, the Conservatives are not giving up just yet. They are asking the Commons ethics committee to launch its own investigation into the affair, starting with calling Wilson-Raybould to testify by no later than March 27. The Liberal-dominated committee is to consider the request on Thursday.

A month ago, when the Commons voted on another opposition motion to let the former minister testify freely, Wilson-Raybould abstained but then added fuel to the SNC-Lavalin fire by saying: ""I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency; privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth.""

Liberals nervously waited to see whether she or Philpott would bring another can of gas to Wednesday's vote. They did not, adding to Liberals' professed comfort at letting the pair remain in the governing caucus and seek re-election as Liberals this fall, despite their lack of confidence in the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould attended part of a closed-door Liberal caucus meeting Wednesday morning but Philpott did not show up.

""They've both indicated that they continue to believe in the Liberal party and want to stand for us in the election in the fall. I look forward to continuing to work together,"" Trudeau said on his way into the caucus meeting.

""You know, sometimes there are differences of opinion but we're a big tent,"" echoed Liberal caucus chair Francis Scarpaleggia, a Quebec MP.

Despite the efforts to unite and put the affair behind them, one source said Philpott faced a ""frank and emotional"" session with her Ontario caucus colleagues prior to the national caucus meeting she did not attend. And both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were allowed to miss the marathon voting session, in the belief that sleep-deprived Liberal MPs might take out their frustration on the pair as the voting dragged on into the wee hours of the morning.

The source spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss confidential caucus matters.

OTTAWA — The federal Liberals are promising to spend more than $250 million to revamp the body Canadians turn to with disputes over access to federal benefits, partially restoring the system that existed before the Conservatives created the Social Security Tribunal.

The tribunal hears appeals of government decisions on things like eligibility for employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan that, before 2013, were overseen by four separate bodies.

Key changes included cutting the number of people hearing most cases from three to one, and replacing part-time hearing officials in many places with full-time staff in fewer locations.

In an interview this week, Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said the government will bring back the three-person hearings for the first layer of benefit appeals — in a body separate from the tribunal — and retain the tribunal's single arbitrator for the second, and final, layer.

He said the changes respond to rare agreement from labour and employer groups that some sort of return to the three-panel hearing system was needed.

Tuesday's federal budget proposes spending $253.8 million over five years, beginning in April, to make the system easier to navigate and shorten decision times. Details about when changes will happen are to be rolled out later.

""It was felt by EI commissioners and the stakeholder communities, both employers and employees, that there was a lack of transparency, and a lack of collaboration in the way in which the system was working,"" Duclos said in an interview Wednesday.

""So despite the fact that it was not in my mandate letter, we did feel that it was important to transform the system and there will, therefore, be a return to a tripartite system — more fair, more respectful, faster, (and) more collaborative.""

When the Conservatives unveiled their plans to create the Social Security Tribunal, they argued it would streamline the appeals process and save millions of dollars.

A report last year from consulting firm KPMG estimated the tribunal saved federal coffers about $22.6 million a year, but waits for decisions also shot up as the tribunal was undermanned and overwhelmed with cases and didn't have a proper transition plan.

Average timelines for decisions increased from approximately 44 days to more than 200, and in the worst case, average wait times of 884 days for decisions on CPP disability benefits that were highlighted in a critical 2016 auditor general's report.

What the Liberals heard in closed-door meetings and consultations with stakeholders, labour and employers groups, as well as experts over the last three years were calls for a return to the system as it existed before the tribunal's creation.

At the same time, the KPMG report warned against that, arguing the tribunal could be improved, and some who worked in the system felt things were much better than what existed before.

""(I)t became eventually very clear to me in conversations with employers and employees — and I can tell you there was a consensus, which is rare in that environment ... that we needed to transform, to reform that system for all sorts of reasons,"" Duclos said. ""The first was that it was very unfair, very complex and to the most vulnerable workers in our country, it was not only unfair, but also very slow.""

The tribunal has been changing its operations as officials waited for the budget announcement to publicly detail the future of the tribunal.

Appellants can choose whether to have hearings in person, on the phone or by videoconference. Rule changes have also made it easier to launch appeals and wait times have dropped. The backlog of cases has fallen from about 7,250 in April 2017 to 3,925 at the end of last year.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans’ magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to “share completely” her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott’s remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau’s closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

“Until we are able to put this behind us, it’s pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,” Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: “No, we never gave a number.”

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company’s share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

OTTAWA – The Liberals will happily run on their economic record in the upcoming federal election campaign, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday, despite the billions of dollars they’ve added to the national debt.

At an afternoon stop outside a housing development in Ottawa’s eastern suburbs, touting the measures in the new federal budget to make homes more affordable, Trudeau gave what sounded much like a stump speech, talking about “historic investments” in Canadians – getting there after dismissing Conservatives’ complaints that the Liberals should have to answer more for the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“What eats away at the Conservatives the most is that our approach is working,” he said. “Over the past three years, 900,000 Canadians created new jobs. Over the past three years, we’ve seen the lowest employment in 40 years. And we’ve see 825,000 Canadians, including 300,000 kids, lifted out of poverty because of measures this government is taking. And in this budget we just put forward yesterday, from easier access to home-ownership, to support for students, to money directly for seniors, to investments in broadband and high-speed internet access right across the country, we are responding to the priorities that Canadians have. The Conservatives have no plan for the economy, that’s why they want to talk about anything else. We are going to stay focused on delivering for Canadians, as we are today.”

While Trudeau emphasizes what all the government spending has done, the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer say it’s a spree funded by borrowing against the future.

Scheer had given a public speech to his caucus members in Ottawa earlier in the day, portraying Trudeau’s Liberals as a big-spending government with nothing but disdain for the idea of balanced budgets.

During the 2015 campaign, Trudeau warned that a Liberal government would initially run modest deficits, but would balance the books by 2019. That promise went out the window Tuesday with a budget that projects of 2019-20 deficit of $19.8 billion.

“During the televised leaders’ debate, he said this: ‘I am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way we always have… We will balance the budget in 2019,’ ” Scheer said to the laughter of his colleagues. “Canadians who don’t have family fortunes like him know … that you can’t borrow your way out of debt and you can’t make other people pay for your mistakes.”

Trudeau acknowledged that his government has been borrowing heavily but he emphasized that although the national debt keeps growing, the economy is growing at about the same rate, so the burden isn’t getting harder to bear.

“Canadians need to know that our projections are sustainable,” he said,

Finance Minister Bill Morneau made his own post-budget sales effort Wednesday, defending the Liberal strategy of investing in consumer confidence.

The budget Morneau tabled Tuesday in the House of Commons showcased several measures aimed at helping more would-be homebuyers get into the housing market for the first time; that’s what he focused on in a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

Under the new measures, the government is proposing to pick up five per cent of a mortgage on the purchase of an existing home for households that earn under $120,000 and have been approved for a mortgage no more than four times their income – or 10 per cent, if the house is new, in an attempt to spur construction. The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take up to $35,000 from their tax-free retirement savings accounts to spend on homes.

But Morneau is insisting the government has also taken prudent steps to ensure that additional demand in markets like Toronto and Vancouver won’t result in higher prices.

“When we think about the overall homebuyer market, we have roughly half a million home purchases a year, but 100,000 of them are first-time homebuyers,” Morneau told a news conference after a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

“We’re talking about (adding) 20, maybe 30, maybe 40,000 new families, which is really important to those families, but we’ve done the modelling to show (it’s) not an issue around changing demand dynamics.”

In particular, Morneau picked out three other measures in the budget that he said are aimed at preventing a spike in home prices: A Canada Revenue Agency crackdown on real-estate money-laundering, $10 billion in affordable rental construction financing and a $300-million contest of sorts to challenge municipalities to come up with creative solutions to adding housing stock.

“All these measures to increase supply, which is fundamentally what we need in markets like Toronto and Vancouver, and then very targeted issues around how we can help first-time homebuyers,” he said. “We’ve been carefully able to help those families without changing the overall dynamics.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hoping the festivities would distract from Jody Wilson-Raybould and the SNC-Lavalin scandal after the Liberal-majority justice committee ruled against letting the former attorney general speak again, effectively shutting down the committee investigating the issue.

However, it appears once the pomp and circumstance of the budget have faded, Canadians will still want answers that only Wilson-Raybould and the PM can provide.

In other words, this is not going away.

One of those questions is why the former attorney general was fired, although the reason appears to be because she wouldn’t give SNC-Lavalin the get-out-of-jail-free card the Liberals wanted in order to secure their votes in Quebec.

Another is whether current Attorney General David Lametti will do what Wilson-Raybould refused to do and grant the Liberals their wish.

Liberal supporters have said it is the Opposition and those who simply dislike Trudeau who are keeping this story alive for political gain.

It is the Liberals who are keeping this story alive by failing to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak and by continuing to drag out the narrative on a daily basis with their shabby handling of the affair.

Delaying the justice committee’s decision not to let Wilson-Raybould speak until the day of the budget and the sudden early retirement of Michael Wernick, the supposedly unbiased clerk of the Privy Council (who got to testify twice), are just two of the latest examples of keeping this story in the headlines.

The new funding includes more than $15-million over five years to create a Canadian Centre for Energy Information, an apparent effort to redress what experts have long called a woeful lack of understanding of the country’s energy landscape and efforts to combat climate change.

But despite the spending bump, some critics are already worrying the money falls short of what Canada needs to fix its data deficit, which often leaves the country lagging peers such as Britain and the United States in the availability of core statistics.

Tuesday’s budget commitments come amid a continuing Globe and Mail series looking at Canada’s chronic shortage of public data. For example, we don’t know the annual marriage and divorce rate, how far Canadians drive, how many long-term-care homes exist in the country or how much doctors are paid by drug companies, among dozens of other blind spots.

In response to The Globe’s reporting, the Liberal government declined to make any firm commitments to fill these data gaps, even while acknowledging that Canada has many.

These could be areas where there is no ability to compare across provinces or cities, where the existing information is years out of date, published infrequently or not comparable with prior years.

Still, a hub for energy stats is something academics have been urging for years. The budget promises about $3-million a year for Natural Resources Canada to collaborate with Statistics Canada on a website that will compile energy numbers from across levels of government, and look to collect missing data.

Nicholas Rivers, a Canada Research Chair in climate and energy policy at the University of Ottawa, says such gaps pockmark the field. Numbers on how much gasoline is sold in various provinces are often out of date and full of unexplained holes, for example.

But while Mr. Rivers approved of the government’s proposed data hub in principle, he said its budget appears inadequate to the challenge facing the country. He noted that, in 2016, the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration had annual funding of US$122-million, or an order of magnitude more than what Ottawa is providing for the new centre.

Three million dollars ""is not nothing, but it’s not transformative either,” he said. “I would be disappointed if this is just a reorganization of existing resources with a new website.”

There are similar concerns around the $1.5-million over five years that has been allocated to collecting more standardized data around gender equality.

“It is great that the federal government is beginning to shine a light on the lack of data to inform gender-aware policy-making,” said Sarah Kaplan, director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. “But the funding is likely to be highly inadequate to develop the kinds of data required. It is unclear to me if standardizing frameworks is as important as identifying what new types of data need to be collected or what new analyses need to be performed.”

The budget contains several other passels of money for data collection by different ministries, including around housing supply and organ donation. It promises $79-million over seven years for education, health and other surveys in Indigenous communities, to be led by the First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC) – a commitment the group’s executive director Jonathan Dewar applauded.

“As a First Nations-led non-profit committed to helping First Nations achieve data sovereignty, FNIGC welcomes the announcement in the federal budget of permanent and ongoing funding for our current survey efforts,” he said.

Still, relatively little new money in this budget goes directly to Statscan – despite previous Liberal efforts to restore funding to the national statistical agency that had been cut by Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.

“It’s a disappointment,” said Wayne Smith, former chief statistician at Statscan, adding that he had expected to see more reinvestment in the agency’s base funding. “There’s not going to be a fundamental change in the availability of data without new funding.”

Masse accuses Liberals of leaving the auto sector in the dust

The Trudeau Liberals are being accused of abandoning the Canadian auto industry.

Windsor West MP Brian Masse said the $5,000 rebate for electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles announced in Tuesday’s budget does nothing for the Windsor-built Chrysler Pacifica. He said the federal budget is subsidizing foreign-built vehicles.

“I was shocked and appalled in the 2019 Liberal federal budget that provides subsidies to purchase vehicles built in other countries,” Masse said in a news release Wednesday night.

Masse said the budget has no new money for investment in the auto sector or the supply chain to take advantage of new opportunities in Detroit and establishes another corporate tax giveaway that does nothing to strengthen Canadian producers or support autoworkers.

He said the incentive only applies to vehicles priced below $45,000 and the only Canadian built vehicle that could be considered, is the Chrysler Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid, which has a list price of $51,000. Masse added all the other vehicles available in the market are foreign built.

Masse wrote the Minister of Innovation requesting a working group to ensure Ontario-based suppliers can take advantage of Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s recently announced $6.5 billion investment in five facilities in the Detroit area to build and assemble new SUV and truck models.

That calculation is based on multiplying the number of Canadian children enrolled in schools—currently about five million—by the number of school days and an estimated price per meal of $2.,"The Liberal government has proposed creating a national school meal program, which, if implemented, would see Canada join most other advanced economies in the world in having a countrywide school food initiative.

In yesterday’s federal budget, the government announced its “intention to work with provinces and territories towards the creation of a National School Food Program.” The one-sentence declaration was tucked into Liberals’ sprawling 464-page federal budget, the last of this government before Canadians head to the polls in October.

No money was earmarked in the budget for the proposed policy. It’s also uncertain whether a national program can be achieved given funding costs and potential provincial opposition to the federal Liberals’ idea.

Although there is a patchwork of existing local and provincial programs in the country providing funding for food for school children from junior kindergarten to Grade 12, Canada is the only G7 country and member of the 30-plus-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to lack a national school meal program, according to a 2016 report by two Simon Fraser University business professors.

The proposed school program in the budget was grouped with the unveiling of a $134-million national food policy designed to increase Canadians’ access to healthy foods, promote domestically grown and harvested food, support food security in the North, and reduce food waste.

Debbie Field, co-ordinator for the Coalition for Healthy School Food, called the proposal a “huge deal,” comparing it to other major social welfare programs.

“It’s a major social policy initiative,” she said. “Sometimes one line in a budget like this creates national pharmacare or other things like that. It really is at that level.”

Ms. Field said a national school meal program can help address children’s access to healthy and nutritious foods. In terms of this metric, Canada lags behind most other rich countries.

A 2017 UNICEF report ranked Canada 37th of 41 wealthy countries when it comes to food security, ending hunger, and improving nutrition. The report suggested a national school meal program could contribute to improvements in children’s healthy eating.

Poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and food insecurity are often problems for people living on lower incomes and those belonging to marginalized populations. Studies have also shown that healthy eating can correlate with improved educational outcomes.

“It’s a great first step and the coalition is looking forward to working with the federal government,” said Ms. Field.

Liberal MP Julie Dabrusin (Toronto-Danforth, Ont.) has pushed her government to put in place a school meals program, and is currently sponsoring a petition calling for the creation of an “adequately-funded national cost-shared universal healthy school food program.” Retired Liberal Senator Art Eggleton also put forward a similar motion calling for such an initiative in June 2018.

In a March 20 phone interview, Ms. Dabrusin said the proposed program will “look different in different places.”

“The idea is to work with different provinces and territories with the programs that they want to establish,” she said. “And when you think about it, what the different types of foods people might eat in parts of the country might be different, the needs might be different as to how to best deliver it.”

Ms. Dabrusin said there are many reasons why children may not decide to eat or have access to healthy and nutritious foods, but that it’s important the proposed program is universally available and doesn’t stigmatize poor students.

“There is a tremendous cost to having kids being hungry in school,” she said. “And I hear it from teachers who keep granola bars in their desk to feed kids, because they know that if the kids are hungry [they] can’t concentrate and participate in class.”

In a pre-budget submission to the House Finance Committee, Ms. Field’s organization asked for the Liberal government to invest $360-million, through provincial and territorial transfers, into a school food program, with an eventual goal of universal coverage.

Ms. Field said the total national cost of such a school meal program would be around $1.8-billion a year. That calculation is based on multiplying the number of Canadian children enrolled in schools—currently about five million—by the number of school days and an estimated price per meal of $2.

Oliver Anderson, a spokesperson for Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau (Compton-Stanstead, Que.), said “our government believes that all Canadians should have access to safe, healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate, and local food.” He said the food policy includes taking the “first steps” towards a national school meal program.

“We will have more to share on this in the weeks and months to come,” he said in an email.

The previous Conservative government under Stephen Harper, however, was cool to the idea of a national school meal program, with a Health Canada departmental spokesperson telling The Tyee in 2014: “The provision of food in schools is a provincial and territorial responsibility.”

In 1946, the United States created its national school meal program. In 2016, 30 million American children participated in the initiative providing free or low-priced meals at a cost of $13.6-billion for taxpayers, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures.

The program works by offering school districts and independent schools cash subsidies and government-bought food for each reimbursable meal they serve, which is required to meet federal standards.

The standards are a source of political contention, however, with the Trump administration loosening Obama-era requirements on grains, salt, and milk in 2017.

Ms. Field said Canada can follow the example of its G7 counterpart of France, or the example set by Finland, which she said have the best national programs in the world. She said their programs offer cooked, healthy, culturally appropriate, and often locally sourced foods.

Food insecurity is a challenge experienced at some level by four million Canadians, according to research done by PROOF, a University of Toronto-based research group studying policy choices to reduce the problem. It also found that household food insecurity affects one in six Canadian children.

Ms. Field described the current coverage of school food through provincial and locally funded school food programs as a “hodgepodge.”

“We all pride ourselves on our health-care system. We all pride ourselves on the fact that Canada has more progressive social policy than the U.S. on many issues,” Ms. Field said. “But we’re not doing well on this.”

The tax breaks fall under ...","OTTAWA, Ont. —

Buried within the federal budget Tuesday were details of how the federal government plans to prop up Canada’s struggling print media industry.

Last year’s budget announced $50 million over five years to support “local journalism,” after media companies lobbied the government to help mitigate the corrosive effects of the internet on their businesses. In November’s fall economic statement, the government announced three new tax measures costing $595 million over five years.

“Concerns have been expressed that, without government intervention, there may be a decline in the quantity and quality of journalism available to Canadians, including a significant loss of local news coverage,” said the government’s statement last November.

However, many of the specifics of the measures — and definitions of what the government considers “qualified Canadian journalism organizations” and “eligible newsroom employees” — were not made public until Tuesday.

The tax breaks fall under three categories: allowing non-profit journalism organizations to register for something similar to charitable status, so they can receive donations and be exempt from income tax; giving news organizations a labour tax credit applied to the salaries of journalists they employ; and offering a tax credit to Canadians who subscribe to “Canadian digital news.”

The labour tax credit, which applies as of Jan. 1, allows journalism employers to apply a 25-per-cent refundable tax credit to the salaries of editorial employees at a cap of $55,000 per person, or a maximum credit of $13,750. Broadcasters and outlets that receive funding from the Canada Periodical Fund will not be eligible.

Canadians who buy digital news subscriptions between 2019 and 2025 will be able to claim an annual 15-per-cent tax credit on up to $500 in costs, for a maximum credit of $75. This credit, too, isn’t applicable to content produced by broadcasters.

The way definitions are set out in the budget, news outlets will only benefit from tax measures if they are registered as a corporation, partnership or trust; if they are incorporated and resident in Canada; if their chairperson and at least 75 per cent of directors are Canadian citizens; and in the case of partnerships or trusts, if they own at least a 75-per-cent share.

The organizations must employ at least two journalists who operate at an “arm’s length” from management and be “primarily engaged in the production of original news content.” The news must fit into “matters of general interest and reports of current events, including coverage of democratic institutions and processes.” Publications focused on industry-specific news, sports, arts or entertainment are excluded.

There are further requirements that organizations have a board of directors or trustees that operate independently of one another and of journalists and that they “not be factually controlled” by an individual or group. The definition stipulates that any additional business the organization conducts be related to journalism.

Similar to registered charities, “qualified” news outlets will be required to make public filings with the Canada Revenue Agency that contain information about their activities.

As of 2020, the non-profit news outlets that qualify as donees must publicly report large donations and issue tax receipts to donors. Any one source of gifts or donations can’t be responsible for more than 20 per cent of total revenue — unless it’s by bequest, or the minister of finance specifically approves it, according to a draft of the legislative changes that would be required.

For the labour tax credit, additional criteria apply. Public corporations must be listed on a stock exchange in Canada and not be controlled by non-Canadian citizens. Private corporations must be at least 75-per-cent owned by Canadian citizens or by public corporations described above.

Similar to registered charities, 'qualified' news outlets will be required to make public filings with the Canada Revenue Agency

The budget document also sets out what constitutes an “eligible newsroom employee” for the purposes of that credit — the journalist needs to work for the organization at least 26 hours a week, and must be, or expected to be, an employee for a minimum of 40 consecutive weeks.

The “eligible” journalists must spend at least 75 per cent of their time “engaged in the production of news content, including by researching, collecting information, verifying facts, photographing, writing, editing, designing and otherwise preparing content.”

The definitions are not necessarily set in stone. An “independent panel,” about which few details are yet available, will have the ability to make recommendations on eligibility criteria. It is expected to be formed soon, more likely within weeks rather than months.

The budget Morneau tabled Tuesday in the House of Commons, his last before Canadian voters go to the polls this fall, showcased several measures aimed at helping more would-be homebuyers get into the housing market for the first time.

Under the new measures, the government is proposing to pick up five per cent of a mortgage on the purchase of an existing home for households that earn under $120,000 and have been approved for a mortgage no more than four times their income — or 10 per cent, if the house is new, in an attempt to spur construction. The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take up to $35,000 from their tax-free retirement savings accounts to spend on homes.

But Morneau is insisting the government has also taken prudent steps to ensure that additional demand in markets like Toronto and Vancouver won't result in higher prices.

""When we think about the overall homebuyer market, we have roughly half a million home purchases a year, but 100,000 of them are first-time homebuyers,"" Morneau told a news conference after a speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

""We're talking about (adding) 20, maybe 30, maybe 40,000 new families, which is really important to those families, but we've done the modelling to show (it's) not an issue around changing demand dynamics.""

In particular, Morneau singled out three other measures in the budget that he said are aimed at preventing a spike in home prices: A Canada Revenue Agency crackdown on real-estate money-laundering, $10 billion in affordable rental construction financing and a $300-million contest of sorts to challenge municipalities to come up with creative solutions to adding housing stock.

""All these measures to increase supply, which is fundamentally what we need in markets like Toronto and Vancouver, and then very targeted issues around how we can help first-time homebuyers,"" he said. ""We've been carefully able to help those families without changing the overall dynamics.""

Even as Morneau spoke, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was addressing caucus members in Ottawa, portraying Justin Trudeau's Liberals as a big-spending government with nothing but disdain for the idea of balanced budgets.

During the 2015 campaign, Trudeau warned that a Liberal government would initially run modest deficits, but would balance the books by 2019. That promise went out the window Tuesday with a budget that projects of 2019-20 deficit of $19.8 billion.

""During the televised leaders' debate, he said this: 'I am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way we always have... We will balance the budget in 2019,'"" Scheer said to the laughter of his caucus colleagues. ""Canadians who don't have family fortunes like him know ... that you can't borrow your way out of debt and you can't make other people pay for your mistakes.""

Morneau, however, made it clear the Liberals believe they can justify that decision on the campaign trail.

""First and foremost, we want to make sure we make the investments that give people the optimism for the future, and that is our first priority,"" he said. ""That approach has clearly worked — we have a much better situation for Canadians with better job numbers and fewer people struggling to get by than we had three and a half years ago; we're going to keep investing in that way.""

Rather than focusing on the raw deficit, the Liberals prefer to talk about Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio, or what the finance minister described Wednesday as ""debt as a function of our economy"" — a lens that puts a much rosier tinge on the federal books.

""We have, as I've mentioned, the lowest amount of debt as a function of our economy among G7 countries; that amount of debt as a function of our economy has been reduced each year we've been in office,"" Morneau said.

""That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately.""

On the housing measures in the budget, Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Wednesday that they could be seen as an extension of the National Housing Strategy, which deals with demand as well as supply. The strategy is a 10-year, $40-billion plan.

Duclos said the caps on the proposed mortgage-sharing program should send a signal to developers “to invest in the type of homes that first-time homebuyers are willing and interested and able to buy.""

There are already providers in the country offering these “shared-equity mortgages,” including developers that take a stake in units to reduce monthly mortgage costs for owners. When a unit is sold for a profit, they share in the gains; the opposite is true when a unit is sold for a loss.

Am I the only one asking why the federal Liberals continue to pander to Canadian dairy farmers (the majority of whom are in Quebec and Ontario)?

article continues below

In addition to a quarter-billion-dollar fund allotted in 2016, the new budget gives yet another $3.65 billion to feed this “forever at the trough” cartel. That’s about $4 billion that is little more than a payment of political patronage to a cohort whose products Canadians are forced (by virtue of the supply management system) to pay exorbitant prices for.

Why does the federal government continue to support a dairy cartel by protecting their high prices, by paying cartel members billions (as in the current budget) every time we sign a trade deal to minimally increase dairy imports and even by allowing the dairy major processors to control and profit from the majority of (duty-free) dairy imports from the new trade partners?

As Canadians take time to prepare their income-tax returns, they might pause a minute or two to consider how the Liberal government spends their tax dollars.

But maybe it’s just me.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese

OTTAWA – Travellers, immigration detainees and others who feel they have been mistreated by Canada’s border agency will be able to complain to an independent body under a new measure included in the federal budget.

The Liberal government is planning legislative changes to give the RCMP watchdog the additional responsibility of handling public complaints about the Canada Border Services Agency.

The budget allocates $24 million over five years, starting in 2019-20, and $7 million a year after that, to expand the mandate of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP.

Border officers can stop travellers for questioning, take blood and breath samples, and search, detain and arrest people without warrants.

The agency’s internal recourse directorate handles complaints from the public, while other bodies, including the courts, the federal privacy commissioner and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, examine various concerns about the agency’s work.

But the border agency is not overseen by a dedicated, independent review or complaints body, prompting civil libertarians, refugee lawyers and parliamentary committees to call for stronger arm’s-length monitoring.

The Liberal-dominated justice committee did its best this week, slamming shut the door on any further hearings, least of all God forbid recalling the deposed attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has done his best too, steadily stonewalling opposition and media questions with inane and disingenuous prattle about “standing up for Canadian jobs.”

But the scandal lives, thanks, o cruel irony, to SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce.

Wednesday, Bruce went on a bit of a media blitz, speaking to reporters from various organizations.

(I tried to be among them, but SNC’s media folks only belatedly answered my two emails, and without addressing the possibility of an interview with Bruce.)

In these various interviews, among other things, Bruce said unequivocally that the company never threatened to move its headquarters (contrary to what the retiring clerk of the privy council Michael Wernick told Wilson-Raybould would happen); has never cited the loss of 9,000 jobs as a reason SNC should get a deferred prosecution agreement or DPA, but nonetheless insisted there’s a public interest for a DPA so those employees aren’t forced to work for U.S. or European firms, and perhaps most curiously, in at least two interviews is reported as saying he still doesn’t understand why SNC wasn’t given a DPA.

Now, I am no lawyer but the Criminal Code section on DPAs, called “remediation agreements” in Canada, is pretty clear.

Under “factors not to consider,” the legislation specifically prohibits the prosecutor (which in this case means Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions, and her former boss Wilson-Raybould) from considering “the national economic interest, the potential effect on relations with a state other than Canada or the identity of the organization or individual involved” if the organization is alleged to have committed an offence under Section 3 of Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Officials Act.

Section 3 (1) (b) of that act reads as follows: “Every person commits an offence who, in order to obtain or retain an advantage in the course of business, directly or indirectly gives, offers or agrees to give or offer a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind to a foreign public official to any person for the benefit of a foreign public official to induce the official to use his or her position to influence any acts or decisions of the foreign state or public international organization for which the official performs duties or functions.”

SNC-Lavalin is, unhappily, charged with one count of fraud under the Criminal Code and one count of bribing a foreign public official under paragraph 3 (1) (b) of the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act.

The RCMP laid the charges in February of 2015, alleging the company offered bribes worth almost $48 million “to one or several public officials” of the government of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

The case has yet to go to trial, with a decision from the preliminary hearing judge expected soon.

Let’s assume the judge throws out the charges, or at least the bribing a foreign public official one.

Well, then and only then would SNC-Lavalin be eligible for a DPA. Until then, it seems the charge precludes the company from being considered.

I note that in her recent decision, wherein she struck down SNC’s application for judicial review of the Roussel/Wilson-Raybould decision, Federal Court Judge Catherine Kane appeared to agree with my feeble analysis, writing that when the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act is involved, “as in this case, the prosecutor is not to consider the national economic interest when forming an opinion that a remediation agreement is in the public interest.”

Thus I’m curious, what the SNC CEO doesn’t understand. (It’s one of the questions I would have asked him.)

We want to put this behind us SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce

In an interview with The Globe and Mail, with Bruce described as “visibly angry,” he said, “Nobody appears to give a crap about whether we fail or not in Canada.

“We want to put this behind us. I mean, we’ve been under this cloud for seven years. No other place in the world would you be under this cloud for seven years… When is this going to end?”

Don’t blame him for being angry, certainly about the length of time it takes a criminal case to move through the courts. Don’t blame SNC for lobbying its pants off, as indeed it did. Don’t disagree that it appears the company has cleaned up its act under his watch, though in fairness, SNC is hardly the corporate equivalent of a first-time young offender deserving of the greatest leniency.

SNC is not at fault for the dizzying effects of its lobbying efforts; that lies solely with the PM, the PMO and senior government officials. The company is not responsible for how those officials interpreted the spectacular pressure to which they were subjected. As Canadians now know all too well, people can experience the same event differently.

Neil Bruce is from Scotland and has the most wonderful accent. He appears to speak plainly. And in that regard at least, how brilliantly he compares to the Canadian PM and most elected officials.

Five new ways to save on your taxes in the Federal Budget Liberals leave themselves little wiggle room in the event of a ...,"In a move that appears to target some of the country’s highest earners in the corporate sector, the Liberal government will introduce a new measure that will limit the tax-deductible amount on employee stock option plans to just $200,000 from the current uncapped amount.

The new rule, however, will apply only to “large, long-established, mature firms,” according to the budget document.

Startups and “emerging Canadian businesses” will be exempt from the rule, in order to help businesses that might not have the means to attract top talent due to profitability and cash flow issues.

Stock options that have been exercised are effectively taxed at half of an individual’s personal income tax rate. They are used by many companies to compensate top-level executives that are in a high tax bracket.

For instance, if an employee is granted 100,000 in options at a price of $50 and in two years, that share price has gone up to $70, the employee who exercises her options will reap a benefit of $2 million ($20 x 100,000). Under the current system, that employee is eligible to claim a tax deduction on $1 million of the benefit.

Now, regardless of how many shares an employee of an established firm is awarded, or how much the share price goes up, only $200,000 in employee stock option grants will receive tax-preferred treatment.

“The idea is to take away some of the advantages that high-income earners currently enjoy, and introduce more tax symmetry into the system,” said Carmela Pallotto, tax partner at auditing firm KPMG.

In 2017, 2,330 individuals earning over $1 million claimed approximately $1.3 billion in employee stock option deductions. By contrast, 20,140 individuals with an income of less than $200,000 claimed just $120 million in stock option deductions, or six per cent of the aggregate amount.

“When examining the evidence, it is clear that the employee stock option deduction is highly regressive,” the budget stated.

“The government does not believe that employee stock options should be used as a tax-preferred method of compensation of executives of large, mature companies.”

More details about the measure, including when it comes into effect, will be announced next summer.

Some tax experts have raised concerns about what is meant by “large, long-established and mature firms.”

“What is really unclear to me right now, is who is a mature company? Who is a start-up? The government has to clarify this differentiation and make sure it is done fairly,” Bruce Ball, vice-president of taxation at Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, said.

Ball also questioned whether this new system would be competitive when compared to stock option deduction incentives in other countries. The government is claiming that this new stock option tax treatment is a move that is “aligned” with the United States.

One of the other caveats outlined by the Liberals in the imposition of the stock option deduction cap is that it would not apply retroactively, meaning that current employees of legacy companies with handsome stock option compensation packages will not be affected.

“To me, that raises the question that if a company grants options tomorrow, can they potentially grandfathered? Some companies may immediately start thinking about what they can do to accelerate granting options,” KPMG’s Pallotto said.

The stock option deduction cap is in fact, not a new proposal by the Liberals. In the fall of 2015, Finance Minister Bill Morneau floated the idea of a $100,000 stock option deduction cap, but decided against implementing it at the time.

The Liberals claim that their efforts to improve the “fairness of the tax system” over the last three years has enabled the government to recoup $3 billion in revenue, which they say has been reinvested in tax reductions and benefits geared towards the middle class.

Philpott addressed the group at the beginning of the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled and was described by people in the room as ""rough"" and ""uncomfortable.""

Philpott — widely considered to be one of the most competent and respected ministers in the Trudeau government — resigned from the Liberal cabinet March 4, saying in a public statement that she had lost confidence in how the Trudeau government was handling the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Today's meeting of the Ontario regional caucus was the first since Philpott resigned. She did not attend today's meeting of the national Liberal caucus.

She remains a member of the caucus and has said she intends to seek re-election as the Liberal candidate in her Markham-Stouffville riding.

Today, some of her fellow Liberal MPs reminded her that others in the caucus had made compromises on sensitive issues such as medical assistance in dying — one of the key pieces of legislation Philpott fronted as health minister, along with then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking a Deferred Prosecution Agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Wilson-Raybould also remains in the Liberal caucus and says she will run in the fall campaign under the party's banner.

Trudeau touts 'strong team'

As caucus tensions played out behind closed doors today, Trudeau insisted the Liberals are a ""strong team"" bound by a collective focus on growing the economy for the middle class, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and promoting gender equality.

""As the two members in question have indicated, they intend to run as Liberals in the next election,"" he said during an event in Orleans, Ont., where he was promoting the housing affordability measures in Tuesday's budget. ""We will continue to work together and make sure that we're delivering tangibly for Canadians the way we did with this most recent budget.""

In the statement announcing her resignation from cabinet, Philpott said that after ""serious reflection"" on the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks, she concluded she must quit.

""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations,"" she said.

""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Earlier today, Celina Caesar-Chavannes quit the Liberal caucus, apologizing for harm she had caused through an interview with the Globe and Mail.

The Whitby, Ont. MP told the newspaper that when she first told Trudeau she did not plan to seek re-election, he became hostile towards her.

""He was yelling. He was yelling that I didn't appreciate him, that he'd given me so much,"" Caesar-Chavannes told the Globe.

312,World,2019-03-21T13:45:00.0000000Z,The Canadian Forces has 540 soldiers in Latvia and leads a NATO battlegroup there. They have been in Latvia since mid-2017 and the Liberal government says they will remain there until 2023.,"The Canadian government has added its voice to condemning an annual parade held in Latvia to honour members of the Nazi SS, warning it opposes such events glorifying Adolf Hitler’s regime.

Around 1,000 people marched in the parade in Riga on March 16 to honour the Latvian SS divisions which fought for the Nazis in the Second World War. Some in the parade wore swastikas and other Nazi insignias.

The parade has been controversial for decades, with the United Nations, European Parliament and various politicians raising concerns about event while Jewish groups have called on Latvia to put a halt to the gathering.

Amy Mills, a spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada, said the Canadian government seeks to promote tolerance and respect for human rights. “Canada is strongly opposed to the glorification of Nazism and all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, intolerance and extremism,” Mills said. ”That is why we condemn the parade to commemorate the Latvian SS Brigade held in Latvia on March 16th.”

“We do not tolerate antisemitism of any form, at any time, or in any place and are deeply concerned about new and resurgent forms of antisemitism and discrimination worldwide, rooted in a misguided belief that diversity is a threat,” she added.

Mills said Canada’s close relationship with Latvia includes discussions on the development of an “inclusive Latvia.”

“Every country must come to grips with difficult periods in its past,” she added.

The Canadian Forces has 540 soldiers in Latvia and leads a NATO battlegroup there. They have been in Latvia since mid-2017 and the Liberal government says they will remain there until 2023.

Hitler ordered the creation of the Latvian SS divisions in 1943, with the initial core of the force made up of members of Latvian units such as the Arajs Kommando, which participated in the murder of 26,000 Jews. Other Latvians were conscripted to join the force.

Some members of the Latvian SS Division were among the last hold-outs of Hitler’s regime, defending parts of Berlin during the final days of fighting in the Second World War.

The Latvian government has defended the parade, noting that “16 March is not an official remembrance day, and people, on their own private initiative, pay their respects to the fallen soldiers.”

The Latvian government also has on its website a 14-page document that argues Russian “disinformation” is behind efforts to paint the gathering in an unfavorable light.

“The Latvian Legion as a military formation has no relation to the Holocaust or war crimes,” the document from Latvian historians noted.

The document did, however, acknowledge that some members who served in the Latvian SS units were tried after the war for their participation in the Holocaust but suggests those killings of innocent people were done before they joined the SS formation.

The Embassy of Latvia in Canada has also pushed back against criticism of members of the Latvian SS units and the annual parade. It recently labelled a Ottawa Citizen commentary describing the participation of Latvians in the SS division and the Holocaust as a “threat to democracy in the world.”

“One must study history in order to understand the truth,” the embassy added in a tweet.

The Latvian historians state 80 to 85 per cent of those Latvians who served in the SS division were conscripted and had strong anti-German sentiments. Many Latvians see those who fought in the SS unit as heroes since they battled the Soviets. The Soviet Union, at the time, was allied with the U.S., Britain, Canada and other nations who formed an alliance to defeat Nazi Germany and the nations that supported Hitler.

B’nai Brith Canada has also raised concerns about the parade and other events in Latvia. In the summer of 2018 B’nai Brith Canada’s chief executive officer Michael Mostyn called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to use his trip to Latvia that year to push back against that country’s glorification of Nazi collaborators as well as attempts to deny the nation’s role in the Holocaust. “We must challenge all those who distort the historical record on governments, military units or organizations that fought with, supported or sympathized with the Nazis during World War II,” Mostyn wrote to Trudeau. “This includes government leaders who acquiesce in, or fail to condemn, a process of Nazi glorification that amounts to Holocaust distortion.”

In 2014 the Israeli government raised concerns about a musical being performed in Latvia that celebrated the life of Nazi war criminal Herbert Cukurs. Cukurs was a key member in the Arajs Kommando and was known as the “Butcher of Riga.” A number of Holocaust survivors have directly linked Cukurs to the murder of Jews. Cukurs is a national hero in Latvia.

Concerns have also been raised about similar events in other nations. In late April 2018 more than 50 members of the U.S. Congress condemned Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to glorify those Ukrainians who collaborated with the Nazis. The letter, signed by both Republicans and Democrats, outlined concerns about ongoing ceremonies to glorify leaders of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army as well as 14th SS Galizien Division.

In 2018 the Trudeau government removed a number of Russian diplomats from Canada, citing their efforts that outed Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s Ukrainian-born grandfather, Michael Chomiak, as a Nazi collaborator. Trudeau said the Russians were “sharing scurrilous stories” about Freeland on social media.

Chomiak edited a newspaper for the Nazis which included anti-Semitic essays and cartoons as well as articles highlighting the need for Ukrainians to join the SS. The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, which has copies of Chomiak’s publication in its archives, describes it as a “collaborator” newspaper.

The company had very recently confirmed ...","Nearly everyone now knows the story of how Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, has alleged that she was unduly pressured by Trudeau and other senior officials to offer a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

All opinions belong to the writer; however, writers are expected to adhere to our guidelines. We welcome new bloggers -- contact us for details ...","As expected, the Assembly of First Nations was first out of the gate offering glowing praise for this Liberal government's federal budget, followed shortly thereafter by the Metis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami -- the three male-dominated national Aboriginal organizations. Their organizations have seen substantial increases in funding for their political organizations in recent years.

Meanwhile, the Native Women's Association of Canada -- the only political organization representing Indigenous women at the national level -- issued its own press release criticizing the government for failing Indigenous women. They accused the federal government of, once again, ignoring the pressing needs of Indigenous women and in so doing, not only hampering reconciliation but breaching their core human rights. NWAC is especially aggrieved about this lack of funding for Indigenous women and families, given the urgent need to address murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls.

The exclusion of Indigenous women and girls as a priority in this federal budget is a glaring example of the ongoing racism and sexism that is so deeply embedded in Canada's laws, policies, practices and institutions -- the very same racism and sexism the Liberal government claims to be against.

When the federal government announced the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls in 2016, the former Liberal Minister for the Status of Women Patty Hadju spoke of the urgent need to address the longstanding racism and sexism embedded in Canada's institutions. Yet, this urgent policy objective is not reflected in any substantive way in federal budget 2019.

In fact, there are no funds allocated for a comprehensive plan to address violence against women generally, and no funds for a targeted comprehensive of plan of action to address violence against Indigenous women and girls specifically. Indigenous and women's organizations have called on Canada to take comprehensive action now to implement recommendations from the United Nations treaty bodies to reduce murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls before the national inquiry's report is released.

The National Inquiry's report is due out in less than a month and there is no budget set aside to implement whatever recommendations come from that report either. The limited funds for commemoration seems not only inadequate, but also premature given that the crisis has not abated. Where is the urgent and sustained help for the many families deeply impacted by the abuse, exploitation, trafficking, disappearances and murders of thousands of Indigenous women and girls?

A particularly shocking exclusion from the budget is the lack of funding for First Nations child and family services to address the crisis of First Nations children in foster care. Former Minister of Indigenous Services Jane Philpott called the staggering statistics related to First Nation kids in care a ""humanitarian crisis"" -- comparing it to the residential school system. She pledged to work with First Nations to address the critical need for funding to prevent apprehensions and address the root causes of over-representation, which include conditions of poverty.

This glaring omission from the budget is confounding given the fact that Parliament had previously committed to targeted funding to accompany Bill C-92 An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis children, youth and families, which already been introduced in Parliament. Although the federal government promised significant funding to support Bill C-92 -- there is no specified funding either in the bill or the budget. Not a single dollar has been allocated to support First Nations develop their own laws and institutions specific to child and family services, hire and train staff, as well as provide the much-needed wrap-around social, educational and health services to families in need as advocated in the Spirit Bear Plan.

Dr. Cindy Blackstock, the head of the First Nation Child and Family Caring Society welcomed the additional funding for Jordan's Principle, however explained that it does not go far enough and many children -- like non-status Indian children are still excluded. Jordan's Principle is a child-first principle which aims to ensure First Nation children can access all public services in a culturally-appropriate way, without any delays or hurdles because they are First Nations.

The federal budget pledges $1.2 billion over three years. However, the flat funding does not take into account population growth over the funded years, or the rising cost of inflation. There are also no additional funds to address the thousands of First Nation children who will be newly entitled to Indian status as a result of Bill S-3 An Act to Amend the Indian Act (elimination of sex-based inequities in registration) or from the revised unstated paternity policy in relation to registration. Both of these issues are the result of the federal government losing two court cases (Descheneaux and Gehl) on discrimination against First Nations women and children.

Yet, despite the legal obligation to provide funding, none has been identified in this budget. This limited funding is not an act of reconciliation. The federal has been dragged to this point -- kicking and screaming -- by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, with no less than five non-compliance orders for failing to end discrimination in funding of First Nation children in care. So, while the extra funding is welcome, it is not a ""gift.""

A particularly disturbing omission is the lack of targeted funding for First Nation women and their descendants who would newly entitled to Indian status under Bill S-3. The bill has been in place for a year and will add thousands to the registration list, yet no new funds have been identified for education, health or housing for individuals or First Nations. This is despite the fact that the United Nations just agreed with Sharon McIvor that the Indian Act still discriminates against the descendants of First Nations women who married-out, and directed Canada to provide full reparation. This means registering them and providing much-needed social programs.

Similarly, there is no targeted funding to address the increase in registration due to Lynn Gehl's successful court case against Canada for it's discriminatory unstated paternity policy. At every turn, First Nations women and children are forced to wait for justice and are denied their basic human rights and access to the same programs and services available to their fathers, brothers and uncles.

One of the most under-served categories of First Nations are those living off-reserve. Approximately 33 per cent of First Nations live off-reserve in Canada, and a disproportionate number of families are headed by single Indigenous mothers. Metis and Inuit don't live on reserves at all -- therefore the majority of Indigenous peoples live off-reserve. The amount allocated in the budget is a mere $60 million over 5 years to help fund off-reserve organizations like native friendship centres. That is barely $10 million a year -- nowhere near what is needed to address urgent housing, education, and health needs for more than 800,000 Indigenous peoples living off-reserve -- let alone the growing homelessness crisis plaguing Indigenous peoples. Niigaan Sinclair reports in the Winnipeg Free Press that the chronic under-funding is made worse by the fact that federal bureaucrats and other consultants and contractors suck up nearly 50 per cent of all funding appropriated by Parliament for First Nations. With three departments now directly responsible for Indigenous and Northern Affairs, who is to say whether First Nations will see much of this funding at all, let alone Indigenous women and children.

While there are many other problems with federal budget 2019, the most glaring omission is the exclusion of Indigenous women and children. Back in 2016, the Liberal government promised a gender-based analysis for future budgets. Yet, this budget lacks a gender-based, human rights–based and Indigenous rights–based analysis that focuses on not just policy objectives like reconciliation, but concrete domestic and international legal obligations.

There is no mention of returning lands and resources back to First Nations, no mention of a financial plan in relation to treaty implementation or how the federal government will ensure Indigenous women's voices are at the many negotiating tables they fund. This budget is a disgrace and does little to address any of the pressing Indigenous issues impacting Indigenous women and children like kids in care, murdered and missing Indigenous women, over-incarceration, homelessness, unequal access to Indian status, poverty and poor health outcomes. Trudeau makes good use of flowery speeches and tearful apologies to Indigenous peoples, but has left Indigenous women and children far behind -- again.

Perhaps Prime Minister Trudeau should give some Indigenous women a call and figure out how to amend the budget so it better reflects the law in this country. At least, that's what a feminist prime minister would do.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “thumbing his nose” at Canadians, and said the official Opposition would use “every tool available to us” to hold the government accountable in Parliament.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is slated to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

Scheer called the government’s budget “a political prop” in its “unprecedented cover-up” of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau’s top adviser and the country’s most senior public servant to resign.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs unsuccessfully pressed the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould so she could shed more light on the simmering controversy.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin finds itself at the centre of a national political storm over allegations prime ministerial aides crossed a line in leaning on Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair.

“What happened today is absolutely outrageous,” said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

“If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister’s misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.”

Liberals on the justice committee wrote to the chairman, fellow Liberal Anthony Housefather, this week to say the committee had done its job and should move on to other business.

“As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,” says the letter. “Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed. Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

Liberal committee member Randy Boissonault reiterated the contents of the letter following the meeting, saying Tuesday’s session was the 10th in five weeks, amounting to 13 hours of testimony given by 10 witnesses.

“We have heard from many of the key players in this matter,” he said.

The Liberal members tabled a motion Tuesday calling for the committee to begin a study of the rise of hate crimes in Canada.

They say the federal ethics commissioner, who has launched a probe of the SNC-Lavalin matter, is best suited to investigate the political controversy.

They also note former justice minister Anne McLellan has been appointed to explore the relationship between the government and the minister of justice, who plays a second role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

But the opposition would have none of it.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said the committee should hold town-hall meetings on SNC-Lavalin and hear from Canadians about the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has a right to reply to other witnesses including Gerald Butts, the former top adviser to Trudeau, Raitt said in objecting to the Liberal effort to move on.

“They’re controlling what is being said, they’re controlling who is being heard from, they’re controlling whether or not we study a topic. This is really egregious and absolutely shameful.”

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin called it “yet another effort to change the channel” by the government.

SNC-Lavalin faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya. The company unsuccessfully pressed the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a “remediation agreement,” a legal means of holding an organization to account for wrongdoing without a formal finding of guilt.

The director told SNC-Lavalin in October that negotiating a remediation agreement would be inappropriate in this particular case.

Wilson-Raybould has told the justice committee she was relentlessly pressured to ensure the Montreal engineering giant was invited to negotiate an agreement. She was shuffled from the justice portfolio in January, becoming veterans affairs minister.

Trudeau has denied that any undue pressure was placed on Wilson-Raybould.

She has testified at the justice committee for nearly four hours, but has indicated there is more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Butts, once considered Trudeau’s right-hand man, quit his job as principal secretary, saying he did not want to be a distraction from the government’s agenda. In addition, Jane Philpott left cabinet over the government’s handling of the controversy.

The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country’s top public servant, having concluded he’s lost the trust of opposition parties.

HE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Petr David Josek

MONTREAL – Proposed rules to limit natural testosterone levels in some female track and field athletes are unscientific and would set a precedent for discriminating against people based on their natural abilities, a Canadian researcher says.

In an editorial published Wednesday in the medical journal BMJ, Universite de Montreal professor Cara Tannenbaum and Sheree Bekker of the University of Bath take aim at restrictions proposed by the international governing body for the sport of athletics. The rules would force female runners with differences of sex development to medically lower their testosterone levels before they could race internationally at distances from 400 meters through the mile.

In an interview, Tannenbaum said there isn’t enough evidence to prove that increased testosterone causes improved results, and there’s no reason to force women with naturally high hormone levels to compete with men.

“What they’re doing is they’re essentially defining a female athlete by the (level) of testosterone in her blood, and certainly in medical science we don’t define individuals as men and women based on a blood test,” Tannenbaum said in a phone interview.

The proposed rules by the International Association of Athletics Federations, or IAAF, would require competitors to maintain testosterone levels to below 5 nanomoles per litre of blood in order to compete in certain events.

However, the governing body agreed last year to delay the implementation of the new rules pending a decision on an appeal brought by two-time 800-metre Olympic champion Caster Semenya, who would be forced to lower her natural hormone levels under the new rules.

The South African athlete appealed the hormone regulations to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, arguing the governing body lacks scientific evidence that testosterone levels substantially enhance sports performance. Semenya’s lawyers have said she is facing discrimination for “genetic gifts” that should instead be celebrated.

A panel of judges is expected to announce a decision by March 26.

Tannenbaum, who is scientific director for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s Institute of Gender and Health, said there is “absolutely zero research” to suggest that high testosterone levels can make someone a great athlete. She said performance depends on multiple factors, including training, skill, and various other physical and mental qualities.

“I bet if you went on the street today and randomly took blood and tested the testosterone of everyone driving from work … you would probably have people who had the exact testosterone level in their blood as many of the Olympic athletes, but that doesn’t mean they could win the Olympics,” she said.

The IAAF has disputed the claim that its findings aren’t scientific.

“There is a broad medical and scientific consensus, supported by peer-reviewed data and evidence from the field, that the high levels of endogenous testosterone circulating in athletes with certain (differences of sex development) can significantly enhance their sporting performance,” the organization wrote last year.

Tannenbaum says the issue raises a host of larger questions, including how to define what separates a male athlete from a female one, and what constitutes an unfair biological advantage, given that most elite athletes have no shortage of genetic gifts that make them faster, taller, or stronger than the vast majority of the population.

“If you’re born with bigger feet, should you not be able to play soccer?” she asked. “If you had a genetic superiority because you’re very, very tall, should you not be able to play basketball?”

Tannenbaum believes that, at the very least, there needs to be more research before any new rules are adopted to categorize women based on biological measures.

But she also questions why any limits need to be placed on an athlete such as Semenya, who is classified as a woman and identifies as such, just because of her exceptional ability.

“The whole idea of the Olympics is to look for individuals who are born with extraordinary talent or ability,” Tannenbaum said.

A protesting First Nations woman who was pushed to the ground during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Climate Action Rally at the Danforth Music Hall on March 4, says the prime minister “witnessed” her being assaulted, and “did nothing.”

The woman is 26-year-old Vanessa Gray, a community organizer from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation. In a press release written a few days after the incident, Gray said it is disturbing that many of the people who attended the event, including Trudeau himself, did nothing.

At the event, Trudeau was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers and protestors in the crowd, who were immediately ushered out by security.

Gray said she went to ensure that the voices of Indigenous people were present and draw attention to the ongoing colonial and environmental violence that indigenous people experience in Canada.

Before arriving at the event, Gray hid a Canadian flag in her shirt that said, “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.”

She said it was to remind those at the event that ground zero of environmental violence is occurring right now on unceded land.

Videos and photographs of the incident have been making the rounds online.

During Trudeau’s speech, Gray threw her flag and shouted “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.” Seconds later, an older white man, in a blue shirt, pushed her down to the floor.

“Shocked, but not deterred I rose up and continued to speak, ‘No Justice on Stolen Native Land.’ I said this over and over until security pulled me from the rally,” she wrote in her statement.

While Gray was quickly escorted out, the man, who is yet to be identified, remained inside the event and continued to cheer Trudeau on.

In a video taken during the event, Trudeau can be seen witnessing the scuffle and uttering “Oh boy, oh boy,” moments after Gray is pushed to the ground.

Gray has been speaking up against environmental violence for eight years.

She and her lawyer Nick Cake, with Millars Law, are considering her legal options. Cake said they are in a preliminary stage and are reviewing all options and working to determine the best possible path.

“Our options include filing a police report because police didn’t take any action on that day. Another avenue will be civil remedies that may be available. Another would be to leverage a conversation between Vanessa and the prime minister’s office,” he said.

Andrew Coyne

Mostly it was a rehash of the measures already announced in November’s Fall Economic Statement: a labour cost subsidy (in the form of a tax credit — presumably this sounds more palatable) for journalism organizations, a tax credit/subsidy for digital news subscribers, and charitable tax status for news organizations that register as non-profits. Only if you turned back further still, to an annex marked Tax Measures: Supplementary Information, would you find the details.

What you would discover, if you did, was how a bad idea in principle was likely to be infinitely worse in practice.

There are any number of objections to the government getting into the game of propping up failing news organizations: that taking money from the people we cover will place us in a permanent and inescapable conflict of interest; that it will produce newspapers concerned less with appealing to readers than to grantsmen; that it will not only leave us dependent on government, but without standing to oppose such dependence in others; that it will solve none of our problems, but only encourage us to put off dealing with them; that it is all so bloody unnecessary.

But the most potent objection is that, as the government cannot possibly bail out everybody — for in the internet age what was formerly a tidy little constellation of newspapers and other outlets has exploded into a vast universe of what could plausibly be called news organizations — it must inevitably get into choosing who should receive its blessing and who should not.

Whether this is done directly by the prime minister or by his designates, whether the preference is based on partisanship, or ideology, or connections, or mere incumbency, it is not an appropriate role for government in a democracy. Subsidizing speech the government likes is not materially different from suppressing speech it doesn’t like, and indeed may have much the same effect.

You might understand that in the abstract, but it’s when you see the details of how they propose to go about it that the chill really sets in.

Henceforth, if this goes ahead, the Canadian journalism business will be divided into two groups: on the one hand, a coterie of government-approved trough-feeders adorned with little merit badges identifying them as Qualified Canadian Journalism Organizations, and on the other, everyone else. Eligibility for QCJO status is ostensibly to be decided by an “independent panel” of journalists, but the government has already dictated a list of its own not-so-independent criteria in advance.

Thus, a QCJO would have to be “organized as a corporation, partnership or trust” (no sole proprietorships), incorporated in Canada and 75 per cent Canadian-owned (no foreign-based or -owned publications); and “primarily engaged,” not only in producing “original news content,” but news content of a particular kind: “matters of general interest and reports of current events, including coverage of democratic institutions and processes,” but not “primarily focused on a particular topic such as industry-specific news, sports, recreation, arts, lifestyle or entertainment.”

So: the government will subsidize department stores, but not boutiques. Why? The same reason the 25 per cent wage subsidy, like the 15 per cent subscription subsidy, is restricted to news organizations that “primarily” produce “written content.” Because that description neatly excludes anyone outside the existing Canadian newspaper industry. And that’s who this policy is designed for: not the future of news but the past; not the scrappy startups who might save the business, but the lumbering dinosaurs who are taking it down.

That’s, as I say, before the independent panel has even been struck. What additional criteria its members will come up with can only be guessed at — the November statement suggested they would also be asked to “define and promote core journalism standards” and “define professional journalism,” which sounds even more ominous.

How independent will the panel be? How will its members be chosen, and by whom? If previous such exercises, for example the Senate selection model, are any guide, they will not be partisan Liberals, as such — just reliably progressive in outlook. Of course they will be. For they will have already selected themselves: not just by their enthusiasm for the idea of a government body picking which news organizations live or die, but by the firm conviction that they are just the sort of person who ought to be a member of that body.

And why not? Membership on the panel, as on the (presumably separate) administrative body that will “evaluate” organizations according to how well they adhere to the panel’s criteria, will carry with it extraordinary power — over businesses, over careers. Possibly news organizations will be prohibited from lobbying panel members, but nothing can prevent them from sucking up to them, whether in the issues they cover or the stances they take.

But then, again, their work would be half-done before they had started: self-selection would have already winnowed the field. What sort of news organization do you think would operate as a non-profit, the kind that charitable tax status would benefit? Would it be likely to be, say, a strong believer in the profit motive? What sort of organization would be most likely to apply for the labour subsidy? The kind that advocates for less government intervention in the economy? And yet, those organizations that refused to apply would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage relative to those that did.

The inevitable result will be to tilt the field, gradually perhaps but irreversibly, in favour of progressives and of progressive views — not necessarily congenial to the government of the day, but certainly to government, and absolutely certainly within the ambit of “acceptable” opinion. The radical, the unorthodox, the unsettling or unappealing — to some, though not to others — need not apply.

You say something like this is already in place, in broadcasting? Yes it is. I’m not sure the CBC is really an advertisement for the wonders of subsidized newsgathering. But that’s not the point. Maybe there’s a place for the CBC, or something like it, as one offering among others. The point is, if this goes through, everything will be subsidized: print, broadcast, the works — a whole industry of CBCs. If you were searching for a way to kill the news business, you couldn’t do a better job.",Andrew Coyne: It's when you read details of media bailout that the chill sets in,Cape Breton Post,https://www.capebretonpost.com/opinion/columnists/andrew-coyne-its-when-you-read-details-of-media-bailout-that-the-chill-sets-in-293938/

Fitting, as this year’s show, which runs at the downtown convention centre through Sunday, is awash in green vehicles as never before.

The Nissan Leaf was named 2019 Canadian Green Car of the Year, while the Jaguar I-Pace took the 2019 Canadian Green Utility Vehicle of the Year title. At the recent Toronto Auto Show, the I-Pace claimed 2019 utility vehicle of the year honours, marking the first time an all-electric claimed that honour.

“It’s important for many Canadian drivers to be environmentally aware, and AJAC’s Green Vehicle of the Year awards help them to make the responsible choice when it’s time to buy a new car or utility vehicle,“ AJAC president Mark Richardson said in a release. “If they can save money on fuel while also driving a vehicle with low emissions – or no emissions at all – then everybody wins.”

Entries to the awards must meet the standard requirements for initial entry into the Canadian Car of the Year awards program, and additional criteria for fuel efficiency based on the entry’s size, powertrain and purpose.

All entries are tested by AJAC journalists, and evaluation takes place over months on different road surfaces and road conditions throughout the year and during AJAC’s autumn Test Fest event. The journalists score all eligible entries on parameters including recharge time, driving range, vehicle dynamics, market significance, and overall value. Each of the scores is then weighted for relevance to the vehicle and category in question. The winning score also represents how the vehicle stacks up to its market segment competition, whether green or otherwise.",Leaf and I-Pace top AJAC Green Awards podium,blogs.driving.ca,https://driving.ca/jaguar/auto-shows/vancouver-auto-show/leaf-and-i-pace-top-ajac-green-awards-podium

The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- A new report by a green energy think tank calls for increased investment in electric buses to both reduce emissions and boost Canada's growing manufacturing base of the vehicles.

The report by Clean Energy Canada says that while Canada is a leading manufacturer of electric buses, transit authorities are behind international peers.

China is by far the leader in electric buses with about 99 per cent the world's e-buses, including Shenzhen's more than 16,000-strong fleet. Other cities have also committed to moving in that direction, including Amsterdam that is aiming to transition to zero-emissions buses by 2025 and Los Angeles by 2030.

Several Canadian cities have also set fully-renewable fleet targets, but on less aggressive timelines. Montreal is aiming for 2040, Toronto by 2042 and Vancouver by 2050, the report notes.

The report's call for more buses comes the same week as a study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance Ltd. found the world's electric buses will displace about 270,000 barrels a day of diesel by the end of this year as the heavily used vehicles have an outsized impact on fuel demand.

Clean Energy's report notes Canada has several leading manufacturers of electric buses, including Winnipeg-based New Flyer, Vancouver-based GreenPower, and Quebec-based Lion Electric Co. and Nova Bus, that could be boosted by increased domestic demand.",Green think tank calls for Canada to boost electric buses,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/autos/green-think-tank-calls-for-canada-to-boost-electric-buses-1.4345723

Our review of the 2019 Nissan LEAF

See our Guide to all-electric vehicles in Canada in 2019

The Nissan LEAF has been just as popular here in Canada as it’s been in other markets, and continues to be a reference in the segment. But in 2019 the model faces some stiffer competition, notably from the new Kona Electric and of course the wee Chevrolet Bolt, which both benefit from a substantially longer range (415 km for the former, 383 km for the latter) on a full charge. The LEAF has a range of 241 km.

In response, Nissan has produced an extended-range version called the LEAF PLUS (363 km of range) that is just coming on the market now. It will be interesting to see if the boost in range is enough to keep consumers on board with this model, which does a have a ton of other qualities going for it – a fact confirmed by the AJAC jury.

Another factor the LEAF has going for it? Its starting price of $36,398 makes it eligible for the new EV rebate program just announced by the Canadian federal government as part of its new election-year budget. That program, yet to be implemented, will set a price limit of $45,000 CAD for eligibility for the EV rebate. That makes the much-talked new Kona Electric (starting price of $45,599) ineligible.

If and when the new EV rebate program is up and running, that should give the LEAF quite a leg up on the increasingly stiff competition it faces.

The Yellowknife Co-op recently installed a hydroponic greenhouse on its property. Its general manager hopes to start selling homegrown leafy greens and fresh herbs in four to six weeks time.

“We’ve had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce or Canadian produce,” said manager Justin Nelson.

“There was an opportunity to get involved in a hydroponic greenhouse, so we decided to do an investment in it. We just want to provide to our members some locally-grown produce.”

We’ve had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce. Justin Nelson, manager

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op’s food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer’s greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants “as quickly as possible,” said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that’s running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, “which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.”

The Yellowknife Co-op’s sea can greenhouse isn’t the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Curious Yellowknife Co-op shoppers will be able to watch the in-house farming live.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

“Power and heat up here isn’t cheap, so this isn’t something to subsidize produce here,” he said. “Produce is cheap, it’s no different than other locations in the South.”

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

Though he declined to talk about how much the greenhouse costs, Nelson did say he is “feeling pretty cool” and “pretty happy” about the operation.

The Nissan LEAF has been reinvented for its second generation featuring a 243-kilometre driving range1, all-new attractive exterior design, roomy high tech interior and advanced technologies including ProPILOT Assist and e-Pedal.

""As the pioneer of the world's first, mass-market electric vehicle, we have a duty to offer Canadians an EV that offers more, and continues to spearhead the advancement of the zero-emission segment,"" says Joni Paiva, president of Nissan Canada Inc. ""We have achieved that with the new Nissan LEAF, which provides the right range at the right price, offering a suite of advanced safety technology, and standard features specifically for Canada.""

Entries for Canadian Green Car of the Year and Canadian Green Utility Vehicle of the Year must meet the standard requirements for entry into the Canadian Car of the Year awards program, and must satisfy additional criteria for fuel efficiency based on the entry's size, powertrain and purpose.

All entries are tested by more than 65 AJAC journalists across Canada. Evaluation takes place over months on different road surfaces and road conditions throughout the year and during AJAC's autumn Test Fest event.

""We are honoured to be recognized by AJAC members. We also appreciate the effort put in by AJAC to evaluate solely for this 'Green' category, separating traditional vehicles from those which offer advanced powertrains to bring the industry closer to more sustainable mobility,"" concluded Paiva.

The award from AJAC is added to a growing list of accolades for the new Nissan LEAF, including the 2018 World Green Car of the Year. As of March 5, 2019, the Nissan LEAF became the first electric car in history to surpass 400,000 sales (globally). Recently, a model with a new powertrain joined the lineup: the Nissan LEAF PLUS, which offers increased power and up to 363 kilometres2 of range. Canadian sales of the LEAF PLUS will begin this spring.

About the Nissan LEAF

The focal point of Nissan Intelligent Power in the new LEAF is the e-powertrain, which offers improved energy efficiency and increased torque and power output. The new e-powertrain delivers an exhilarating, linear driving performance with a power output of 147 horsepower, 40 per cent more than the previous-generation LEAF. Torque has been increased 26 percent to 236 lb-ft, resulting in improved acceleration.

Existing LEAF drivers already enjoy the instant response and linearity of performance as they navigate the city. The new LEAF's improved acceleration will boost enjoyment even further. Even with the additional power output, the new LEAF's driving range has been increased. The car's new lithium-ion battery pack delivers a range of 243 kilometres1.

The new battery design adds energy-storage capacity without increasing the size. The battery pack occupies the exact same dimensions as that of the previous-generation LEAF. The individual cell structure of the laminated lithium-ion battery cells have been improved, representing a 67 percent increase in energy density versus the original 2010 LEAF model.

It reported that German industrial giant Siemens AG is teaming up with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to build an underground 560-kilometre transmission line that will carry power from Iowa to the Chicago area. It will be called the SOO Green Renewable Rail.

The prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, but they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, according to some experts. ( MARTIN BERNETTI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO )

So, what’s so special about another power line, even if it’s underground? Just that the electricity it carries will be wind and solar generated. When it’s completed, hopefully by 2024, the line will be capable of transmitting 2,100 megawatts, which the Journal says is the equivalent of a large nuclear power plant. Although two European companies are undertaking the project, there’s a Canadian connection. Most of the route will run along a Canadian Pacific railroad corridor, which should make it easier to obtain the necessary permits. I found this story intriguing because I had no idea that solar and wind generation had reached such a substantial scale. I had been under the mistaken impression that green energy initiatives were still small-scale ventures that relied heavily on government subsidies to survive.

Not so, says John A. Cook, president of Greenchip Financial Corp., which specializes in this type of investing. “Last year there was $340 billion invested in wind and solar energy projects – more than for all other types of electrical generation,” he told me in a phone interview. He noted that in December, the Alberta Government signed three contracts to provide 600 megawatts of wind generation to the province for the next 20 years (enough to power 255,000 homes). “The remarkable part of this story is the unsubsidized auction price of 3.7 cents per kWh,” he says. “This is about half where wind generation was at only a year ago and is almost as cheap as solar. It is also half what a new natural gas or coal plant could produce these electrons at. The breakthrough can be attributed to technological advances, the good Alberta wind regime, and the low cost of capital large developers now bring. For several reasons, solar will continue to grow faster than wind, but 3.7 cents is a game changer.” Greenchip is a sub-advisor to the recently launched Mackenzie Global Environmental Equities Fund. It has only been around since October, so we don’t have much history to work with. However, the year-to-date gain of 13.25 per cent (to March 11) is impressive. The portfolio is basically the same as the 11-year-old Greenchip Global Equity Fund, which is only open to accredited investors ($250,000 and up).

That Greenchip portfolio consists of several familiar names such as Siemens, Panasonic, Hitachi and Johnson Controls, plus a lot of companies that few people have ever heard of. The largest position is in JinkoSolar, a small-cap producer of solar modules, based in Shanghai. Although the prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, says Cook. It may be hard to believe, but the market capitalization all the listed solar manufacturers in the Greenchip portfolio is just over $10 billion. A single cannabis company, Canopy Growth, has a market cap more than double that.

One reason for the depressed value of solar and wind stocks is that relatively few analysts cover them. Also, environmental sectors generally experience higher levels of technological and regulatory change, which is often missed by investors. Finally, due to the sector’s high growth potential and disruptive nature, individual companies or sub-sectors are susceptible to excessive hype and/or cynicism. The net result, Cook contends, are “incredibly attractive” valuations. So, how do you participate in this energy revolution? There are four Canadian mutual funds that focus on these companies. They include the Mackenzie fund already mentioned, the NEI Environmental Leaders Fund, the Desjardins Societerra Environment Fund (a fund that invests in bonds issued by “responsible” companies), and the AGF Global Sustainable Growth Equity Fund. It’s been around the longest and shows a 10-year average annual return of 9.9 per cent. The portfolio goes well beyond energy to include health care, basic materials, consumer cyclicals, etc. Surprisingly, I could not find a single Canadian-based ETF that focuses on this area. There are several in the U.S., however. One of the largest is the Invesco Solar ETF, which invests in a portfolio of U.S. and international companies that produce solar power or build components for the industry. Its 10-year record is in negative territory but for the first two months of this year it was ahead an amazing 34.85 per cent. Another strong performer this year is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, which was up 17 per cent for 2019 as of March 11. Here again, the 10-year return is negative. Investors have taken a long time to understand this business, but they finally are catching on. Amazingly, this is all happening in a world where the President of the United States is a climate change skeptic, whose policies seek to weaken the development of alternative power sources and, instead, revitalize the coal industry. Clearly, his plans are not working. Alternative energy momentum is building, and investors are increasingly looking to get in on the action.

Michael Green is president and CEO of Canada Health Infoway ...","To adapt to our increasingly just-in-time lives, the Canadian health care system is moving increasingly toward digitization. This necessary modernization of health care means better patient outcomes as well as improved insight into future health-care decisions.

Despite the personal and system-wide benefits of a digital health-care system, what cannot be ignored is that your health information has value to people wishing to take advantage or use the information inappropriately.

The fact remains that Canadians may also be unwittingly sharing their health information. Whether it’s apps that are used, mailing lists that are joined, or online surveys, what is really being tracked is personal health information that tells unscrupulous users information you may not want them to know. If the fine print in the privacy agreement isn’t read and understood, it’s hard to know where your information goes and how it’s used.

Thieves collect personal data such as home addresses and contact information, but also details of physical or mental conditions and prescribed medications. Individuals can be threatened with public exposure of their data, especially those in high-profile positions, and future health benefit claims or even border crossings could be affected.

Compromised personal health data has a much greater and lasting impact. When a credit card is stolen, card numbers are changed and charges in question are typically reimbursed. Conversely, your health record stays with you for life, leaving you more vulnerable to future problems.

Just like Canadians have not shied away from online banking or commerce, the answer isn’t to fear a digital health system either. The benefits to patients, professionals and the overall system are far too great, but we also can’t bury our head in the sand when it comes to privacy or the selling of personal health-care data.

Instead, we must look at ways to protect Canadians while increasing the digital health options available to them. One such tool is Infoway’s PrescribeIT, a paperless e-prescription service that enables prescribers to securely transmit a prescription to a patient’s pharmacy of choice. As a not-for-profit service funded by the federal government, it ensures all personal health information is secure, confidential and only used for its intended purpose.

Finally, the protection of personal data, and especially health data, must be a priority for everyone. Data drives decisions, it allows us to react to new trends in care and system needs, but we can’t let data drive profit at the expense of the patient.

Physicians, pharmacists and all health-care professionals must continue to take an active role in protecting their patients’ data, while at the same time patients must ask questions about how their information is kept safe, secure and guarded against commercial misuse. During Fraud Prevention Month, we have an opportunity to look at where the data in our health system is now and map out a plan that keeps the system healthy and safe for all.

Michael Green is president and CEO of Canada Health Infoway, which helps to improve the health of Canadians by working with partners to accelerate the development, adoption and effective use of digital health solutions across Canada.

The announcement of the award was made by members of the Automotive Journalists’ Association of Canada at the Vancouver Auto Show today.

The brand-new all-electric I-PACE was already the first EV to be named Utility Vehicle of the Year by AJAC, and now it takes the honour in the green category as well. It beat out the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.

“This award for Jaguar proves that the I-PACE is a truly exceptional vehicle. It’s won Canada’s top award for Best Utility Vehicle, based on its merits as an SUV, and now it’s won Canada’s top award for Best Green Utility Vehicle, based on its environmental responsibility.” - AJAC President Mark Richardson

Jaguar-Land Rover, for all its well-publicized struggles to keep sales above water in several global markets, does seem to have caught the eye of award juries, and AJAC is no exception. In the past two years, four Jaguar-Land Rover vehicles have been honoured with AJAC awards: in 2018 the XE was named best small luxury car, the F-TYPE was named best premium sports car and the Range Rover Velar was deemed the best small luxury SUV. In 2019 the Jaguar I-PACE was also named Canada’s best premium EV.

Monday qualifier David Hearn of Brantford ...","This week’s Valspar Championship is playing right into Nick Taylor’s hands.

Taylor, from Abbotsford, B.C., is looking forward to taking on the difficult Copperhead Course at the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor, Fla., this week at the Valspar because it is just that — a challenging par-71 7,340 yards.

“It’s typically a difficult golf course. You have to keep it in play. Par’s not going to hurt you,” said Taylor on Wednesday. “I just prefer courses where 2- or 3-under par is a great score instead of being a shootout like some tournaments where the winner is 20- to 25-under.

“Here, 10- to 14- under is where winners have been and it’s where I would prefer it if I were to pick a tournament.”

The timing is great for Taylor, too. He’s coming off his strongest performance of the season, tying for 16th at 10 under at the hyper-competitive Players Championship.

“My iron play was really solid all week, made a few mistakes the first day. I felt the greens were tough in the afternoon,” said Taylor, who shot a 73 in the first round but recovered with a 69-69-67 line the rest of the way. “I played really well the last three days and cashed in a lot of opportunities on the Sunday to have my best round of the week so that was pretty much the difference.”

Pleased with his overall performance, Taylor isn’t looking to tweak anything about his game, instead focusing on maintaining what brought him success at the Players to the Valspar.

Taylor will be joined by seven other Canadians at the Valspar Championship, matching the record for Canadians at a PGA Tour event outside of the RBC Canadian Open. Monday qualifier David Hearn of Brantford, Ont., Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, dual citizen Austin Connelly, Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., Adam Svensson of Surrey, B.C., and Ben Silverman of Thornhill, Ont., will also play, with the latter being added to the field on Wednesday.

Already a tough course, Taylor played nine holes on Tuesday at Copperhead and another nine at the Pro-Am and said that the greens are firm.

“Early in the morning was a little chilly, but the course is in great shape,” said Taylor. “The greens are fast and pretty firm. If the weather holds up it might be tough.”

LPGA TOUR — Brooke Henderson of Smiths Falls, Ont., took in the Arizona Coyotes game on Saturday, since she was already in Phoenix ahead of the Founders Cup as the LPGA Tour begins its North American season. She’ll be joined in the tournament by fellow Canadians Brittany Marchand (Orangeville, Ont.), Alena Sharp (Hamilton), Jaclyn Lee (Calgary) and Anne-Catherine Tanguay (Quebec City).

WEB.COM TOUR — The Web.com Tour returns after a five-week break with the Chitimacha Louisiana Open at Le Triomphe Golf and Country Club in Broussard, La. Ottawa’s Brad Fritsch, Calgary’s Ryan Yip, Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., Toronto’s Albin Choi and Michael Gligic of Burlington, Ont., are all in the field.

As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.","OTTAWA—For his first question in the House of Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh asked the prime minister whether he was going to make housing more affordable for Canadians. This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is recognized in the House of Commons before taking his place before question period on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. The prime minister and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh, Chantal Hébert writes. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Article Continued Below

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op's food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer's greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants ""as quickly as possible,"" said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that's running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, ""which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.""

The Yellowknife Co-op's sea can greenhouse isn't the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

""Power and heat up here isn't cheap, so this isn't something to subsidize produce here,"" he said. ""Produce is cheap, it's no different than other locations in the South.""

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

335,Sports,2019-03-19T19:16:00.0000000Z,"Travis Green, by the way, likes Motte so take it ... blocking shots.” Good Canadian kid there.","Will dropping the number of homegrown starters in the CFL diminish the Canadiana of the league?

With just 21 sleeps until the NHL’s draft lottery, here’s something else that’s exciting to Vancouver Canucks fans, the musings and meditations on the world of sports.

• The news that the CFL and CFLPA are considering revisions to the player ratio has been floating around the league for a couple of months, but it surfaced violently last week as negotiations opened for a new CBA.

Traditionalists, predictably, had a conniption, claiming the league would sell out its birthright if the ratio was altered. The league, they argue, derives its character and identity from its Canadian content and if the number of Canadian starters is reduced from seven to five, the league will lose its soul.

You can understand their outrage to a point but, in this case the economic considerations of an adjustment outweigh those issues which concern the flag and back bacon. The CFL is a lot of things — not least of which is a uniquely Canadian institution — but it’s also a second-tier professional league trying to survive in a brutally competitive market.

The ratio, unfortunately, distorts the league’s business model. Once you get past the quarterbacks, the highest-paid players aren’t the league’s stars but tend to be veteran Canadians who can play at or near an all-star level. The proposal to reduce their number doesn’t eradicate the Canadiana aspect of the league. But it does reduce the inflationary pressure involved with those players.

The CFL will also argue that expansion will open more jobs to all players, irrespective of their passport, and when you come right down to it, it seems the millennial audience the league is trying to reach isn’t as concerned with the game’s history as their parents and grandparents.

The league is trying to rebrand itself as a global entity which can attract players from all over the world. This is a necessary step in that process.

Now, if they come after the rouge they’ll have a fight on their hands.

• If the Players Championship isn’t the fifth major, it easily qualifies as the fifth-most important tournament in world golf and you can make the case it’s as prestigious as the PGA. It served up another beauty this week, a 16-man battle royal from which Rory McIlroy emerged as the survivor. The new March start date also serves as a brilliant kickoff to the golf season for anyone who lives north of St. Louis.

It has its own history, its own setting and its own unique story to tell each year. Basically, it’s The Masters Lite. which is a pretty good thing to be.

• During Wednesday’s Canucks-Rangers tilt, I made the observation on Twitter that, while the bar isn’t exactly high, Tyler Motte qualifies as one of the more positive stories of this Canucks season.

Didn’t realize this was a hugely controversial position.

Motte, in fact, sets up as a test case in the ongoing debate over analytics. The eyeball test sees the 24-year-old winger as a fourth-liner who kills penalties, has scored nine goals this season and plays the game with speed and tenacity. Among other things, he leads the Canucks in hits by a huge margin.

Again, this is as much a commentary on the rest of the team as Motte.

As for his fancy stats, they are, well, terrible. I’d argue that’s a result of playing most of the season with Jay Beagle and Loui Eriksson in a matchup role, but the analytics folk believe his underlying data is a reflection of Motte as a player. At least that’s what they mentioned on Wednesday in the calm, reasoned language which makes Twitter such a fun place to inhabit.

We can revisit this one this time next year and if I’m wrong, it won’t be the first time.

Travis Green, by the way, likes Motte so take it up with him.

• Ran into an NHL scout in Dallas who spends a lot of time working the NCAA. Here’s his take on Canucks prospect Tyler Madden, who’s just finishing his freshman year at Northeastern.

“The kid’s a stud. I don’t care about his weight (Madden goes a buck fifty-five on a good day). He’ll play and he’s a winner.”

• And finally, it’s been an up-and-down season for Luke Schenn, and that’s putting it mildly. In his career, a larger stardom has eluded the fifth-overall pick in the 2008 draft but, until this season, he spent 10 years in the NHL as a reliable stay-at-home defencemen.

Then things changed, abruptly, and the speed of the game and Schenn’s own limitations made him an expendable commodity. He’s played for four teams this season — Anaheim and the Canucks in the NHL; San Diego and Utica in the AHL — and, as much as anyone, he understands his situation.

“You don’t ask questions,” said the 29-year-old. “When you get in the lineup, you just try to play to the best of your capability. Being in the position I have been this year, I don’t take anything for granted. I just want to enjoy it and have fun.

“When you’re a young guy, you can be naive to the way things can be. When you’re younger, you take certain situations and opportunities for granted. When you get older you learn to appreciate them a lot more, knowing they’re not going to be there forever.”

Schenn drew into the Canucks’ lineup on Sunday because of the injury to Chris Tanev. He also understands the hazards of playing the style he shares with Tanev.

“It would be nice to sit on the half-wall and run the power play but it’s just not in the cards for guys like myself and him,” he said with a laugh. “I did it a couple of times in the minors where you run the power play and you think, man, it would be nice to be doing this my whole career. You’d feel a lot less beaten down.

“But you have to play to your strengths and that’s part of it, taking hits, making hits, blocking shots.”

Good Canadian kid there.

Neighbourhood: Chinatown

Previously: Dim Sum Plus

Owner: Celine Zhang

The food

“I think we’re the first restaurant to bring real Southern Chinese food to Toronto,” says Celine Zhang, who also co-owns Canada’s only other Green Tea franchise, located in Markham (there are 80 locations in China, however). Green Tea is part of the new crop of mainland Chinese chains that have set their expansion sights on the Canadian market. It specializes in Hangzhou-style food, which is known for its ingredient-forward dishes that aren’t overly spicy or greasy: it’s a fresh, light cuisine. “A lot of the dishes are a little sweet, too,” says Zhang. “We add sugar to almost everything to bring out the flavour.”

The drinks

Despite being called Green Tea Restaurant, the focus here is on the fresh-made juices, which include watermelon and pear, along with blends popular in China like cogongrass root and sugar cane. The one tea on offer is longjing, a pan-roasted green tea from Hangzhou.

The space

Zhang took what was previously a bare-bones dim sum place and brought it to life with Southern Chinese–inspired décor, decorative blonde wood and wall murals depicting traditional buildings commonly found in Zhejiang province. “I wanted the space to feel young so it would appeal to students and young professionals,” says Zhang, who says their Markham location abides by a more traditional Chinese aesthetic, which she thinks is a bit dark and heavy.","What’s on the menu at Green Tea, Chinatown’s new place for Hangzhou-style dishes",Toronto Life,https://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/whats-menu-green-tea-chinatowns-new-place-hangzhou-style-dishes/

Businesses with unique inventories are always a pleasure to see, but, unfortunately, sometimes it’s difficult to keep up with the times.

London, Ontario-based gift shop business Green Earth, which has been in business since 1990, has announced it will be closing its doors due to multiple factors.

We are sad to be closing, but we can’t say how much we love our customers and appreciate their business over the years!

“After considering a number of restructuring options we have determined that this is the best course based on an array of business challenges,” Green Earth representative Matthew McBride said.

“We thank all of our loyal employees for their hard work and dedication, and we thank all of our life long customers for so many years of patronage and support, and encourage all to take advantage of the incredible savings on our entire inventory.”

The business is known for its specialty gift items, which come in a large selection of products. These range from candles, jewellry, pots, and intricately-designed dragon eggs.

As a signal of appreciation to customers, Green Earth has also announced a nation-wide liquidation sale event, which could see all products, including many of the aforementioned, receive anywhere from 40 to 80 per cent off.

The sale began on March 9, and will continue until all of its $16 million of inventory, plus fixtures and equipment, is liquidated.



Furniture products, as well as fixtures and equipment, are also available for sale.



“Our stores are really well known in the local markets where we have served our communities for years. McBride said.” The sale provides an opportunity for our loyal customers to buy products at compelling discounts.



“A sale like this is unprecedented in Green Earth’s history. We encourage customers to take advantage while selection is best.”

The topic of whether or not marijuana causes ...","On Feb. 2019, TGO published a story on how a Canadian supplement company was aiming to mitigate marijuana’s negative effects, including hangovers. The topic of whether or not marijuana causes hangovers led to a spirited debate.

“Some users have reported that they have never experienced a cannabis hangover. So, there is a gamut of individual experiences based on anecdotal evidence,” says Thomas Folan, MD, CEO and founder of SolaceMD, an online medical cannabis information, recommendation and consultation platform. “As with so many other areas of cannabis research, more well-performed trials are needed to fully understand what is going on,” Folan notes.

The symptoms of a weed hangover range from headache, nausea, brain fog, dehydration, lethargy to dry eyes. Overconsumption, like it is with alcohol, is the key.

Bethany Rae, founder of Flower & Freedom, a community exploring cannabis use for fitness, admits to experiencing brain fog and a feeling of lethargy when she goes over her sweet spot. “The term hangover doesn’t necessarily make sense to me. But I have experienced brain fog and the feeling of lethargy from overconsuming cannabis—particularly from too many edibles.” Rae uses cannabis for pain relief, anxiety and depression. “I understand cannabis to be a lot like food, and not so much like alcohol or tobacco. When you have education around nutrition, you know what to eat and how much. With cannabis, it’s the same; understanding the amount and strain type is crucial,” she says.

What do the studies say about cannabis hangovers?

Conclusively, not a lot. There’s lack of extensive research done on this topic, and two most commonly known studies were conducted in 1985 and 2006.

The study conducted is 1985 saw participation from 13 male marijuana smokers. The purpose of the study was to determine whether marijuana smoked in the evening would result in subjective or behavioural effects the following morning. “The findings suggest that marijuana smoking can produce residual (hangover) effects the day after smoking. The precise nature and extent of these effects, as well as their practical implications, remain to be determined,” notes the study abstract.

The one published in 2006 examined the association among cannabis use and cognitive performance, mood and human error at work. “The pattern of results suggests two possible effects. First, a hangover-type effect that may increase with frequency of use; second, a subtle effect on cognitive function, perhaps more apparent under cognitive load and/or fatigue, which may increase with more prolonged use,” reads the study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.

Folan points out that “the 2006 study was confounded by concomitant alcohol and tobacco use, so the results must be considered in that light.”

Hangovers: Cannabis versus alcohol

Despite the similarities, alcohol hangovers are more severe and have been reported to induce coma and even cause death.

Unlike cannabis, “the alcohol molecule actually suppresses the hormone in the body that is supposed to hold onto water—appropriately named anti-diuretic hormone, or ADH. This is why people will talk about breaking the seal and attempting to hold out urinating when drinking,” says Folan. “It also explains the reason behind being dehydrated after a drinking session despite (potentially) imbibing copious amounts of fluid. Upon overindulgence, the body’s alcohol dehydrogenase (the enzyme used to break down alcohol) cannot work any faster than if you just had a beer or two. This is not how it is with most substances, including cannabis overconsumption,” he explains.

Is confusion around usage contributing to hangovers?

More than half of respondents (56 percent), who participated in a 2018 survey by Shopper’s Drug Mart in partnership with Environics Research, admitted that with so many different strains and brands, medical cannabis is really confusing. The survey reviewed data from among 1,000 Canadian adults over 18 and years of age or older.

Gerald Major, president and CEO of Canadians for Fair Access to Medical Marijuana, is not surprised. “Cannabis is a medicine, first and foremost; and for those reasons, absolutely requires expert advice. Imagine someone over the age of 50 taking gummies. What if they can’t gauge the dosage and end up taking 100 mg of cannabis? I am certain that would require an emergency visit to the hospital.” A medical cannabis patient himself, Major adds, “you can take cannabis for seizures, Post-traumatic stress disorder, arthritis… but if you are not taking the right thing, then the medical properties that would help with, say, seizures can cause negative effects.”

Source of your cannabis can play a huge role

The product needs to well-sourced and “devoid of contaminants, pesticides and solvents, which could potentially be contributing to side effects and/or hangover,” Folan points out.

Andrew Gordon, senior vice president of strategic partnerships and community at cannabis retailer Kiaro, agrees. “The good news is in a regulated market, one can be assured that the products have been tested for pesticides and residual solvents.”

While the issue of cannabis hangover should be taken seriously, Gordon says, “I also want us to be mindful of a larger hangover—prohibition hangover, one that’s still in the air post-legalization, and affects people, in terms of asking questions or getting involved.”

While cannabis is not harmless, “as a society and as retailers working with regulators, we need to be proactive in interacting with existing and prospective consumers to help reduce stigma and normalize cannabis use in a meaningful way,” he adds.",Going green with cannabis on St. Patrick's Day?

Brett Bundale, The Canadian Press





It started with a chance encounter in a coffee shop. He was charming and attractive, and everything he said mirrored her life.

The relationship developed into a romance but the seduction ended months later in apparent deception, an elaborate scheme by an alleged serial con man to whom she lost thousands of dollars.

""Everything he said to me was a lie,"" says Andrea Speranza, an athletic 49-year-old with long brown hair. ""I couldn't understand how he could make love to me with the sole purpose of ripping me off.""

She has since found multiple alleged victims of Marcel Andre Vautour, a man with a criminal record, warrants for his arrest and several aliases.

His suspected victims say he targets busy career women between the ages of 45 and 50, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty bank accounts across the country.

The Canadian Press has spoken with three women across the country who say they fell victim to his romantic schemes, and one man who was promised a job and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars. Each alleged victim has positively identified photos of the same person.

Vautour did not respond to requests for comment by phone, email or social media. None of the new allegations against him have been proven in court.

Speranza says she's sharing her story to prevent more people from falling victim to his alleged scams.

""I want to stop him from hurting more people,"" Speranza says. ""I'm going to catch a criminal.""

Originally from Ontario, Speranza had a hardscrabble childhood.

Despite her hard upbringing, she graduated from university and moved to Nova Scotia, where she became a firefighter and one of the first female captains in Halifax.

Speranza has dedicated her life to helping others, running an award-winning camp that educates girls about emergency services careers.

When she met a man who called himself March Hebert last summer, they seemed like kindred spirits.

He told her a story about his difficult family life, saying his parents struggled with addictions. But he turned his life around, worked on offshore oil rigs, and purchased hundreds of acres in rural Nova Scotia to build a youth-at-risk facility.

""It was almost like everything about my life he was saying back to me,"" Speranza says.

She says she now realizes it wasn't a chance encounter. He targeted her, she says, using a well-honed script and asking pointed questions to develop a plan.

It started off very casually -- she wasn't looking for a relationship. But she was attracted to his desire to help youth and to give back to the community.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.

He told her she was beautiful. She made him a better person. She was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was falling hard and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

""Everything was just perfect,"" she says. ""He was super accommodating and helpful and complimentary. Nothing I could say or do was wrong.""

Speranza now believes he targeted her to invest in his apparently fabricated youth-at-risk facility. When she instead offered to help him apply for grants, she believes he implemented an exit strategy.

He said he suffered from Crohn's disease and one day he called her to say he'd been hospitalized.

She recalls him saying he was OK, but his wallet had been stolen. He needed money to buy costly medication. Then he had to go to Toronto to get his dog from his ex, and borrowed money for a train ticket and hotel room. He promised to pay her back.

She gave him $5,000.

""He ghosted me after that,"" Speranza says, adding that he never repaid her. ""I pride myself on good decisions. But I had no inkling whatsoever.""

She filed a police report and encouraged another alleged victim she met, Jean-Baptiste Joachin, to do the same.

The French citizen had met Vautour at a hostel in Quebec City and had travelled with him to Halifax, where he was promised a job on an offshore rig.

Joachin allegedly paid Vautour thousands of dollars for training courses. He also opened up Canadian bank accounts and credit cards, which Vautour had access to.

By the time Vautour skipped town last fall, Joachin had lost $30,000.

""He completely blindsided me,"" Joachin said. ""Everything he told me was bullshit.""

Halifax police spokesman John MacLeod confirmed the force has received two complaints of fraud based on case file numbers provided to The Canadian Press by Speranza and Joachin. But he said one incident had been closed while the second was deemed a civil matter.

Meanwhile, Speranza has discovered more alleged victims in other provinces through social media. They exchanged photos of the fraudster to confirm his identity, and have shared information about their cases.

Together, they've pieced together a string of allegations against Vautour across the country.

The Canadian Press has contacted police forces, court houses and justice departments in several provinces and has confirmed he's a wanted man with a criminal past.

Documents obtained from Quebec's Justice Department show Vautour pleaded guilty in 2005 to unauthorized use of credit card data and received a suspended sentence of one year's probation.

In 2015, Quebec courts issued an arrest warrant for Vautour for fraud.

Victoria Law Courts confirmed a warrant for the arrest of Vautour was issued in 2001, and executed in 2009. He pleaded guilty in August 2009 to obtaining by false pretence and served a six-month conditional sentence in the community, followed by two and half years of probation.

Meanwhile, West Kelowna RCMP said they are aware of a recent incident and have a police file open on the matter. But spokesman Jesse O'Donaghey said specific details are not released until charges are laid by Crown counsel.

The Winnipeg Police Service confirmed Vautour is currently the subject of two arrest warrants. Const. Rob Carver said the charges pending from 1998 include possession of goods obtained by crime over $5,000 and personation.

Records from the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick indicate Vautour was charged in 1996 with stealing a Volkswagen Jetta in Dieppe.

Despite efforts by law enforcement, some alleged victims have launched their own investigations -- even hiring a private investigator.

They've tracked down more than 20 phone numbers, 10 email addresses and multiple physical addresses used by Vautour in Canada and overseas.

The alleged victims have even narrowed down his method.

They say he told them all variations on a theme: He had a successful career either working on offshore rigs, as a remotely operated underwater vehicle operator, or running companies.

He claimed he made it big investing in precious metals, cryptocurrency and cannabis, the alleged victims say. He said he owned a white convertible Porsche, a Ford F-350 truck, a baby blue Aston Martin. He even had pictures to show off his upscale possessions.

""He had money and was well-travelled,"" says Jodi McMullin, a woman from the Okanagan area of B.C. who met him on a dating site in January 2018.

The whirlwind romance moved quickly, and they began planning a future together.

He told her he had been working in Vietnam and wanted to stay with her in Canada. But he had tax issues, and needed help cashing a business cheque.

The businesswoman offered to help him out. When she had doubts, he was always ready with an explanation.

""Every time I questioned him on something, he had a response right away,"" she says. ""There was never any hesitation.""

She provided him with her bank account number, and he deposited a cheque and then pressured her to transfer him the money, she says.

McMullin acquiesced and then left for a wedding in the U.S. When she returned, the cheque -- which she later learned was a fake purchased online -- bounced, she says.

""He ended up stealing just over $45,000 from me,"" she says. ""My trust is shot. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it.""

Speranza is determined to bring the man she knew as March to justice, launching www.stopthemarchmadness.com in the hopes of preventing romance fraud and encouraging more potential victims to come forward with anecdotes, stories and possible charges against Vautour.

""This man ruins people's lives and I am in the business of saving people's lives,"" the firefighter says. ""I have to stop him.""",Duped Canadian women go after charming alleged con man,Bell Media,https://london.ctvnews.ca/duped-canadian-women-go-after-charming-alleged-con-man-1.4342350

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled after the federal budget was released Tuesday said they would vote for Justin Trudeau's Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of about three percentage points from February.

That compared with 37 per cent who said they would back the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer, a one-point increase from February, while 14 per cent said they would vote NDP and 10 per cent the Greens.

Scheer also jumped ahead of Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister as the Tory leader got the backing of 25 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau, who has been struggling to contain damage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As for the budget, which the Liberals are hoping will help turn the page on SNC-Lavalin, 12 per cent of respondents said it was good and 19 per cent that it was bad, but 39 per cent said they didn't really know about it.

Leger's internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology and heard from 1,529 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm's online panel.

The Canadians in the field this week at The Players Championship – Adam Hadwin rounds out the Canadian contingent – are only a small part of global group Applebaum has connected ...","PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – On the 18th green at TPC Sawgrass, Laurence Applebaum was laughing and chatting with whomever was around.

Usually standing on that intimidating tee – with water up the left-hand side and a thin fairway – you’re not happy at all. But Golf Canada’s CEO caught Canadians Nick Taylor and Corey Conners coming through in the final hole of their practice round, and how could he not be happy?

Taylor and Conners were wearing shorts. Applebaum was clad in a grey monotone ensemble, the pop of colour reserved for the red in the Golf Canada logo on his shirt. It was like a scene you might stumble upon at any golf club in the country when a trio of friends got together at the end of a round – it just so happened that two of the three are some of the best golfers in the world.

“They’re true professionals on the PGA Tour,” said Applebaum on the veranda of the iconic clubhouse at TPC Sawgrass. “It seems like the vibe amongst those guys is that every week there is a different guy who is finding his groove. Roger Sloan, for example, had a couple great weeks, and to have Adam Hadwin leading that class… it’s so good to have those guys on the Tour and they’ve been great ambassadors for golf in Canada.”

The Canadians in the field this week at The Players Championship – Adam Hadwin rounds out the Canadian contingent – are only a small part of global group Applebaum has connected with already.

As the CEO of Golf Canada, he’s been thrilled to continue to drive the momentum of the organization forward – ‘momentum’ he said, is probably the one word to sum-up the last 12 months or so.

Applebaum, with his second Annual Meeting as CEO in the rearview – where Golf Canada announced its three-year strategic plan – was happy to mix business with pleasure this week in Ponte Vedra Beach.

Martin Slumbers, the chief executive of the R&A, Jay Monahan, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, Canadian golf hall of famer Mike Weir, and Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada president Jeff Monday are just some of crew Applebaum has talked with. He’s enjoyed sharing the good-news story behind this year’s RBC Canadian Open.

“The new date. The new purse. The extension of the RBC sponsorship. The recent news that we’ll have three direct qualifiers from the RBC Canadian Open into the British Open is going to be wonderful,” he said. “We have such a great snowball effect of what’s going on.”

The commissioner, Applebaum said, was instrumental with the new date and helping to bring three partners – RBC, Golf Canada, and the PGA Tour – together to make the upcoming RBC Canadian Open a special one.

He said although the PGA Tour is a big professional sports organization, it’s also a really intimate family.

“They’ve wrapped their arms around Canada,” he said.

With The Players becoming the signature event of the PGA Tour, it’s become a spectacle with the global golf community invited. There are things the organizing team will bring from The Players to the RBC Canadian Open this year.

“When you spend any time here, you realize it’s a little beach town outside Jacksonville, Florida, and it’s become a mecca for golf fans. Golfers, sports fans, people looking for fun things to do – like family entertainment – and they’ve brought food, music, a real spectacle in the middle of March which is really nice,” said Applebaum.

“We’ve learned a lot from what they’ve done. We’ve really got to build our own identity for the RBC Canadian Open and it’s going to be the start of summer when our new event is, which is really exciting.”

Not only is there exciting news around the RBC Canadian Open, but Canadian golf as a whole, said Applebaum.

There are eight Canadians with PGA Tour status this year – nine if you count Graham DeLaet, who is on a major medical exemption and 10 if you count Weir, as a past major champion – which is the most ever.

He also points to the success of Team RBC members Dustin Johnson (as world no.1) and new Team RBC member Webb Simpson (as defending champion at The Players) as something else that’s been a positive through late 2018 and early 2019.

“We want to keep that momentum going,” he said – with a smile, of course.",Momentum builds for 2019 RBC Canadian Open,Golf Canada,https://golfcanada.ca/article/momentum-builds-2019-rbc-canadian-open

Image: Canadian Solar

PV module nameplate capacity by around 26% in 2019, despite the high-end of new shipment guidance increasing by 18%.



Canadian Solar has updated its manufacturing capacity levels reached in 2018, as well as revising upwards expansion plans for 2019.



The company exited 2018 with 1,650MW of multicrystalline ingot capacity, down slightly from 1,700MW in 2017. Multicrystalline wafer capacity stood at 5,000MW, up from 4,000MW in 2017.

The major changes continued to be focused on both cell and module expansions.

The major changes continued to be focused on both cell and module expansions. Canadian Solar increased cell capacity from 4,490MW in 2017 to 6,300MW at the end of 2018. The last updated guidance from Canadian Solar was for cell capacity to reach 6,250MW.

Module capacity was increased from 6,970MW in 2017 to 8,880MW by the end of 2018. The company had previously guided module capacity to reach 8,700MW in 2018.

Both ingot and wafer nameplate capacity was guided to remain unchanged in 2019. With overcapacity rife for multicrystalline ingot/wafers as the likes of LONGi Green Energy continues to expand high-efficiency monocrystalline capacity to a targeted 45GW in 2019, Canadian Solar is benefiting from lower multicrystalline wafer prices from long-term supply partner, GCL-Poly, negating any need to add capacity themselves.

The company has made upward revisions to cell capacity expansions. Cell capacity is planned to reach 7,800MW in 2019, compared to the last update when the target was a minimal increase from 6,250MW in 2018 to 7,100MW in 2019.

However, the biggest change is for module assembly capacity to increase to 11,200MW in 2019, compared to previous guidance of an expansion to 9,640MW in 2019.

Canadian Solar has revised upwards module assembly plans for 2019.

Utilisation rates

Canadian Solar reported total module shipments of 6,615MW in 2018, compared to 6,828MW in 2017. Therefore, average module assembly utilisation rates in 2018 were around 74%.

However, Canadian Solar has guided total module shipments to be in the range of approximately 7,400MW to 7,800MW in 2019. This means that utilisation rates could decline to around 70% at the high-end of guidance or decline to around 66% at the low-end of the 2019 shipment guidance.

Although crystalline silicon module assembly utilisation rates are less critical to profitable operations than thin-film manufacturing, Canadian Solar said that it expected continued ASP (Average Selling Price) pressure in 2019, resulting in lower profitability than in 2018.

Manufacturing milestone

Despite the expected lower average module assembly utilisation rates, Canadian Solar is only the third PV manufacturer to announce plans to take annual nameplate capacity beyond the 10GW milestone.

JinkoSolar is expected to shortly confirm its module assembly annual nameplate capacity had reached around 10.8GW at the end of 2018, while further expansion announcements are expected when it also reports its 2018 financial results.

The third company is LONGi Solar, which PV Tech recently reported that its commissioning of the first phase (2.5GW) of a 5GW module assembly expansion would result in the company having at least 13GW of nameplate capacity in 2019, and had become the largest module manufacturer, from a capacity perspective.",Canadian Solar expanding module capacity to 11.2GW in 2019,PV Tech,https://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/canadian-solar-expanding-module-capacity-to-11.2gw-in-2019

The company has plans to build out to a capacity of 170,000 kg of pot production, potentially putting it among the ...","Cannabis company The Green Organic Dutchman (The Green Organic Dutchman Stock Quote, Chart TSX:TGOD) could be poised to take a significant chunk out of the marijuana market, according to investment coach Tim Nash of Good Investment, who argues that as the only certified organic pot company around, TGOD could capitalize on cannabis culture’s apparent bent towards naturally sourced products.

Like many of the pot companies, TGOD has had a great start to 2019, in its case rising 85 per cent since January 1. Now trading in the mid-$4.00 range, the stock is well off its high of $10.24 set last September, but there are reasons to be bullish on the name.

Last month, the company got the nod from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies in its coverage launch of the cannabis space, where TGOD was one of five Buys listed. (They initiated coverage on nine companies.) Rather than trying to be all things to all pot consumers, concentrating on the organic market could be rewarding, according to Jefferies, who gave the stock a price target of $4.65 per share.

Nash agrees. “This is a really interesting cannabis company. It’s the only one that’s certified organic,” he says, in conversation with BNN Bloomberg last Thursday.

“What it comes down to is that the market is still so young on [cannabis], so for consumers that are buying online, I don’t see a huge amount of differentiation involved. What I’m curious to see is once those stores are available and people can go in and touch it and smell it, are they going to have a preference for an organic cannabis option? If the answer is yes, then this company is very, very well situated to capitalize on it,” Nash says.

After a good day on the greens on Friday ...,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Don’t call him Goldilocks, but Corey Conners finally played the par-3 island green at TPC Sawgrass just right.

During the first round of the Players Championship, his shot at the iconic 17th hole was too soft. That day, he intended to fly his ball past the front pin and use the back stop to get it close. Instead, his shot – which he deemed his luckiest of the day – barely made it over the water before nestling nine feet from the hole. He made par.

During round two, Conners hit his target but the late afternoon green was too hard and his ball skipped forward, almost meeting the same watery fate as Tiger Wood’s ball. Conners’ ball mercifully stopped in the sliver of rough between the green and the water. He made another par.

On Saturday, Conners arrived at the 17th tee at three-under for the day, five-under for the championship.

Weekends at the Players are different. There is a lot more fun to be had outside of the ropes, especially at the island green. The VIP suites surrounding the hole bustled with action. Everyone’s spirits raised by, well, spirits. Below on the grassy amphitheatre, much of the grass had been replaced by chairs and blankets; fans camped out in the best seats in the house for an afternoon of water balls and cold beer. Marshals had all but given up keeping the fans quiet, raising their arms before each shot more in surrender than authority.

Coming off a birdie at the par-5 16th, Conners wasn’t thinking about the crowd.

“I don’t really notice the noise, don’t really mind it when it’s consistent like that,” he said after the round.

On Saturday, the wind at 17 had turned into the players, and with the pin at the front left, Conners found it trickier to get close.

“I think for most guys it will be a wedge, but you’ve got to hit a good wedge,” he said. “It’s a gutsy wedge I guess.”

Conners’ playing partner Matt Wallace, not happy with his wedge shots on Saturday, hit nine-iron and it went long. The Englishman’s lower trajectory shot penetrated the wind and sent his ball to the back tier. Conners’ pitching wedge was higher, hit harder by the wind, but landed gently 12 feet from the hole.

Just right.

“It was a perfect shot,” Conners said “Exactly how I wanted it. I maybe thought it was going to land one or two yards further into the green but I hit it really solid.”

Being a golf nut was about to pay dividends for Conners. After watching similar putts on television throughout the years, he knew that his 12-foot putt would stop breaking near the hole, a subtlety not obvious from the green. There was a pitch mark near his line and he knew if he started his ball just to the right of it, it would go in for birdie.

He did, and it did.

“My mind is always thinking about golf,” he said when asked about the changing course conditions. “Last night on the practice green I was rolling some putts and envisioning some of the holes, sitting on the couch back at the house I was thinking about how some of the holes might play, sort of visualizing what I wanted my shot to look like.”

Conners’ Saturday 68 moved him up the leaderboard into a tie for 24th at six-under par. Another good round Sunday will mean a great payday and valuable FedEx Cup points.

But, beware, this course is a bear.

Taylor battles putter, finally wins

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Nick Taylor’s patience is being tested this week at the Players Championship.

The 30-year-old Canadian arrived at TPC Sawgrass feeling great about his putter before promptly missing several short putts in Thursday’s first round. After a good day on the greens on Friday, nothing would drop on Saturday.

“To be honest there was probably three putts today where a foot short I would have bet a lot of money they were going in, and they didn’t,” Taylor said.

Taylor made a total of just 47 feet of putts during round three. His first three birdies came on near-gimmes from 8 inches, 3-feet-7-inches and 1-foot-7-inches. Taylor hit 15 greens in regulation on Saturday and had plenty of mid-range looks at birdie that went unrewarded.

“You keep telling yourself that eventually, they are going to drop,” he said. “If you keep hitting edges and starting on the lines you are choosing that’s really all you can do.”

Despite frustration setting in, Taylor was playing well and was determined to keep giving himself chances. At the brutally difficult 18th hole, Taylor had one last chance to make a putt. He had 10-feet-5-inches for birdie get to five-under for the week and head to Sunday tied for 32nd at the Players Championship.

It dropped. Finally.

Taylor shot 69 at TPC Sawgrass on Saturday while making just one putt from outside of five feet.

We are grateful to Hyundai Canada and the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association for their financial contribution in making this possible.""","NEXO is powered by hydrogen, a fully sustainable energy source, which allows the vehicle to emit clean water vapour and purify the air as it is being driven. This technology also provides the vehicle with superior range conservation in cold climates compared to other battery electric powertrains, making them particularly resilient for Canadian winters. What's more – a five minute refill will carry you for up to 570 KM.

Modo will make two NEXO vehicles available for consumer use in the coming weeks through its carsharing services. This collaboration will provide Vancouverites with unparalleled access to fuel cell vehicles, allowing more Canadians than ever to learn about and experience this technology firsthand. Hyundai will also be the first to make fuel cell vehicles available for retail sale through select local dealerships.

""Hydrogen vehicles are the most promising type of alternative powertrain transportation in existence today. It's important for us to make innovative green technologies like NEXO readily available for Canadians to ensure a sustainable future,"" says Don Romano, President and CEO of Hyundai Auto Canada Corp. ""We're thrilled to launch NEXO in B.C, as the province is a leader in implementing important sustainability initiatives and is aligned with our vision of introducing new means of clean mobility.""

Hyundai has always been a leader in sustainable transportation, remaining the only automaker in Canada to offer vehicles with four electrified powertrains including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell. With the launch of NEXO, Hyundai becomes the only automotive manufacturer in Canada to offer a second generation fuel cell vehicle – the first being the Tucson Fuel Cell which launched in 2015.

""We are excited to be the first carshare to offer consumers the opportunity to experience a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle for themselves,"" says Patrick Nangle, CEO of Modo. ""Supporting a cleaner BC aligns with Modo's social and environmental purpose as a member-owned co-operative. We are grateful to Hyundai Canada and the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association for their financial contribution in making this possible.""

While hydrogen fueling infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, Vancouver is home to one of Canada's only public refueling stations located in the city's Marpole neighborhood. Members of the public who are interested in test-driving NEXO are able to do so at the Vancouver International Auto Show, which runs from March 19 through 24.

Dividend yields, more often than not, can be deceptive. Sometimes companies pay out more than they can afford, leading to a rush for a coveted yield. Other times, a company pays out much less than it can afford, leading to unattractive dividend yields that miss the attention of income-seeking investors.

In my opinion, Vancouver-based wealth management company Canaccord Genuity (TSX:CF) is one of the latter. If you’re an active stock picker, you’ve probably come across this company’s research on a wide range of Canadian and American stocks. What you’ve probably missed is the fact that equity research is only a small fraction of Canaccord’s operations.

The company provides wealth management, investment banking, and financial consultation services to companies and individuals spread across much of the developed world. While 80% of revenue last year was generated in North America, the company also has operations in the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, European Union, and Australia.

Although the company offers a dividend, the yield is barely 0.65% — one-third the rate on a 10-year Canadian government bond. However, my research indicates six reasons for investors to take a closer look:

Low dividend-payout ratio

Canaccord’s dividend-payout ratio is a mere 11%, which indicates the company is holding back and reinvesting much of the cash it generates. My guess is that the company is building its arsenal for further expansion and acquisitions, like the recently purchased Petsky Prunier LLC, a merger and acquisition specialist based in New York.

Insiders buying

Insiders have been net buyers of the stock over the past 12 months, deploying $2 million in net inflow. The biggest purchase was driven by Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer Stuart Raftus.

Earnings growth

Revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share are all up over the past three fiscal years. The company has swung from a $6 million loss in 2016 to a $82 million profit in 2018.

Share buybacks

The company has bought back and retired 1,028,700 shares over the past 12 months. Assuming the average price for these purchases was $6, the company has deployed 50% more cash in buybacks than dividends over the past year. However, some of this buyback is offset by the dilution caused by the company’s stock compensation to employees.

Buy ratings

The two analysts who cover the stock, Jeff Fenwick of Cormark Securities and Graham Ryding of TD Securities, both have buy ratings on Canaccord Genuity. The average of their respective price targets is $9.25, while the stock trades 33% lower.

Cash on hand

As of December 31, 2018, Canaccord Genuity reported $931 million in cash and cash equivalents. That covers the dividend and buyback more than 93 times.

Bottom line

I suspect that Canaccord Genuity is trying to drive growth through the mergers and acquisitions strategies it specializes in. Over the next few years, much of its cash hoard could be deployed in buying financial companies across the world.

If the company can boost the return on equity with this strategy, investors will ultimately reap the benefits of capital appreciation. Meanwhile, there’s always a chance management will be more generous with dividends and buybacks.",6 Green Flags Indicate This Dividend Stock Could Rally Soon,The Motley Fool Canada,https://www.fool.ca/2019/03/14/6-green-flags-indicate-this-dividend-stock-could-rally-soon/

The rebrand comes as the Company expands the scope of the business to include new developments, including plans to grow industrial hemp for the extraction of cannabidiol (CBD).

“We are extremely pleased with Green Mountain’s enhanced identity, and we feel that the simplified name adjustment better encompasses the Company’s flexibility in its future direction and ability to respond fluidly to the ever-evolving cannabis market,” said Green Mountain President, Wade Attwood. “We built our Company in alliance with our Indigenous partners, and designed our business plans to facilitate expansion and flexibility within these partnerships. While our business activities will still be focused on the large-scale cultivation of high-quality cannabis plants for both recreational and medical purposes, we are in the process of implementing additional ventures which will add significant value to our Company and complement our core mission”.

Green Mountain retained the services of the renowned, award-winning Calgary-based Maverick Agency for the rebrand. Mr. Attwood noted, “We were thrilled to work with Maverick and are very appreciative of the creative, functional and attractive online experience and brand they have created for us. They were a pleasure to work with and worked incredibly hard to truly capture the essence of our Company and the dedication to social responsibility that make us stand out in the market.”

Matthew Howard, Founding Partner and Managing Director for Maverick said, ""Maverick is very pleased to have partnered with such a dynamic and visionary group as Green Mountain. They are unwavering in their vision, and the pairing of their passion and steadfast business acumen make them a powerful contender to enter this space. We are grateful to be able to position the brand and online experience to reflect the values that drive the organization and will power their continued success.”

Formed in the fall of 2017 to pursue an application to become a licensed cultivator and processor of cannabis under Health Canada’s ACMPR program, Green Mountain has secured three properties in the Okanagan Valley in BC. A full cannabis Cultivation and Processing License is in the approval process on a 16-acre parcel in Kaleden, British Columbia, with the first stage of greenhouse construction anticipated to be complete in the spring of 2019. Green Mountain has a Letter of Intent to lease a 98-acre parcel of Indigenous agricultural land and has leased a commercial greenhouse in the White Lake area of Kaleden, intending to cultivate industrial hemp for the extraction of cannabidiol (CBD) and conduct research and development on a high CBD hemp strain.

Once licensed by Health Canada, Green Mountain will grow cannabis and hemp, sell nursery stock, harvest and sell dried cannabis and hemp flower, and process and sell cannabis derivatives. The company has a strong commitment to social responsibility with Indigenous partnerships forming the foundation of its business; through Green Mountain’s operations, it is involved with members of the Penticton Indian Band, Pimicikamak Okimawin, and the Manitoba Métis Federation. The Company is committed to sustainable outdoor and greenhouse growing practices which will reduce environmental impacts and utilize natural elements to ensure the highest quality product.

About Green Mountain

Located in the Okanagan Valley, BC’s best cannabis growing area, Green Mountain is progressing towards becoming one of Canada’s leading, socially responsible, low-cost, large-scale wholesale cannabis and hemp producers. Our team of employees, proven industry experts, and Indigenous partners are working to ensure we will provide safe, sun-grown, high-quality cannabis and hemp using environmentally sustainable cultivation methods and greenhouse technology.

As a wholesale, high-volume, low-cost producer, Green Mountain is ideally positioned to fill a market gap; providing the expanding Canadian medical and recreational cannabis industry with consistently high-quality product utilizing superior genetics.

WINNIPEG, March 15 (MarketsFarm) – Routine business and crusher activity are supporting increases on the ICE canola futures midday Friday, said a Winnipeg-based trader.

“We’re off those lows certainly by a fair chunk, but we’re still below yesterday’s high,” he said, noting the funds are maxed out with their large short positions.

He also pointed to farmers, who have been quite reluctant to sell their canola, as they wait for better prices.

The Canadian dollar slipped under 75 U.S. cents.

There has been nothing new out of China regarding Richardson International. Chinese officials have yet to provide any evidence of Richardson’s canola shipments being contaminated.

Although trade negotiations between the United States and China have slowed, progress is still being made. U.S. President Donald Trump stated the next three to four weeks will determine whether negotiators come to an agreement or not. It’s widely believed Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will sign a deal by the end of April.

It seems sensible to say the team that has swept ...","The new Formula One season opens in Australia on Sunday with the same old question — can Mercedes be beaten? — and a trunkful of tantalizing subplots.

For one, Montreal’s Lance Stroll carries the colours of a new team and the prospect of a smoother road ahead after a rocky ride in his sophomore campaign last season.

The 2019 calendar features a record-matching 21 stops, with the Canadian Grand Prix taking up its usual slot June 7-9 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

To get you primed, here are five key storylines to watch as F1 gets set to go in Melbourne:

Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes

It seems sensible to say the team that has swept the drivers’ and constructors’ championships in each of the last five years enters the new season as the clear favourite.

Hamilton, though, doesn’t want you to think that. He’s been playing up Ferrari’s strong form during pre-season tests and insisting the Silver Arrows are behind by as much as half a second per lap, an eternity in F1 terms.

But we’ve heard this before. Last season, too, Ferrari seemed to have the better car at the outset and at certain points during the campaign. And yet, in the end, Hamilton bagged his fifth drivers’ title with two races to spare.

Which goes to show, despite what the detractors say, the car alone doesn’t win championships. The driver must deliver maximum performance, too, at every opportunity, or pretty well close. And so does the team around him.

No one has delivered better on all three fronts — driver, car, team — than Mercedes since the introduction of hybrid-turbo engines in 2014. That’s why they are where they are, and why they will be difficult to displace.

Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari

Hamilton’s hyperbole aside, it’s true Ferrari looked strong in testing and remains the most likely candidate to break the Mercedes stranglehold on F1.

To do that, though, it must avoid repeating the gaffes of last season — both on and off the track — that saw it squander championship points on too many occasions.

Vettel, a four-time champion, must for his part be more like, well, Hamilton, and put in a near-error-free performance if he is to deliver Ferrari its first drivers’ title since 2007.

This time around, it seems, the atmosphere at the Italian stable is more positive and relaxed under new team principal Mattia Binotto, who has replaced the enigmatic Maurizio Arrivabene. That should help.

But Binotto is not the only big change, nor perhaps the most significant.

The highly rated Charles Leclerc is making his much-anticipated debut as Vettel’s teammate, replacing the veteran Kimi Raikkonen, who’s sitting in Leclerc’s old seat at Alfa Romeo.

With the eager and talented Leclerc nipping at his tailpipe, Vettel will have all the more reason to up his game if he wants to remain Ferrari’s No. 1 title contender.

Lance Stroll and Racing Point

If there is something to be learned from Leclerc’s accelerated move to Ferrari, it is that you don’t need a great car to make a big impression.

The lesson is not lost on Stroll, you’d think.

In just one year in F1, Leclerc, 21, managed to show sufficient promise at a mid-level team to have earned him arguably the most coveted seat on the grid.

Stroll, meanwhile, is starting his third year. At 20, it’s fair to say he’s held his own so far. It’s also reasonable to expect a little bit more.

This season offers a fresh start with a new team — Racing Point, the former Force India outfit that was bought out by a group of investors led by his billionaire father.

Given dad’s influence, Stroll will have all the support he needs to step up and stand out, Leclerc-like.

If he doesn’t, the risk is that pretty soon he’ll be seen as just another also-ran.

Robert Kubica and Williams

Kubica, who’s making an improbable return to F1 after eight years, has strong connections to Montreal — both good and bad.

The bad came in 2007, when he was involved in a horrific crash at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, his airborne BMW-Sauber striking a barrier at 300 km/h. Incredibly, he suffered only minor injuries.

The good came the following year when he returned to the scene of the accident to score his first and only F1 win, stunning the packed grandstands that included a great many emotional members of Montreal’s Polish community.

In 2011, another major setback: Kubica sustained major injuries, including a partially severed forearm, in a rally crash in Italy, and his racing days were thought to be over.

But no. Intense rehabilitation and determination have steered him back to an F1 racing seat at age 34, filling the vacancy left by Stroll at Williams.

Watch for the Polish flags to wave once more on Île Notre Dame come June, no matter the result.

Daniel Ricciardo and Renault

F1 drivers take a risk every time they climb into their cockpits, but Ricciardo’s decision to ditch Red Bull in favour of Renault might rank as his biggest gamble yet.

Red Bull is the only team besides Mercedes and Ferrari to have won races since 2014. Ricciardo has seven to his name — his first coming, coincidentally, at the Canadian Grand Prix that year.

There is no evidence Renault is anywhere near ready to challenge for a win — even a podium might be difficult — so it’s a mystery why the Australian has chosen this path.

The closest he has come to an explanation appeared in a Melbourne newspaper this week, where he was quoted as saying “perhaps the love just wasn’t there” during contract negotiations that left him feeling less wanted than his younger and brasher teammate, Max Verstappen.

Ricciardo, who turns 30 on Canada Day, is among the most talented and popular drivers in F1, and it would be a shame to see his career shift into reverse.

Then again, behind his trademark grin, maybe he knows something the rest of us do not about Renault’s prospects, whether in the short or long term.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.","Open this photo in gallery Andrea Speranza, a captain with Halifax Regional Fire & Emergency, visits Shubie Park in Dartmouth, N.S., on March 12, 2019. Speranza says she was the victim of an elaborate scheme by a con man. Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press

It started with a chance encounter in a coffee shop. He was charming and attractive, and everything he said mirrored her life.

The relationship developed into a romance but the seduction ended months later in apparent deception, an elaborate scheme by an alleged serial con man to whom she lost thousands of dollars.

“Everything he said to me was a lie,” says Andrea Speranza, an athletic 49-year-old with long brown hair. “I couldn’t understand how he could make love to me with the sole purpose of ripping me off.”

Story continues below advertisement

She has since found multiple alleged victims of Marcel Andre Vautour, a man with a criminal record, warrants for his arrest and several aliases.

His suspected victims say he targets busy career women between the ages of 45 and 50, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty bank accounts across the country.

The Canadian Press has spoken with three women across the country who say they fell victim to his romantic schemes, and one man who was promised a job and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars. Each alleged victim has positively identified photos of the same person.

Vautour did not respond to requests for comment by phone, e-mail or social media. None of the new allegations against him have been proven in court.

Speranza says she’s sharing her story to prevent more people from falling victim to his alleged scams.

“I want to stop him from hurting more people,” Speranza says. “I’m going to catch a criminal.”

Originally from Ontario, Speranza had a hardscrabble childhood.

Story continues below advertisement

Despite her hard upbringing, she graduated from university and moved to Nova Scotia, where she became a firefighter and one of the first female captains in Halifax.

Speranza has dedicated her life to helping others, running an award-winning camp that educates girls about emergency services careers.

When she met a man who called himself March Hebert last summer, they seemed like kindred spirits.

He told her a story about his difficult family life, saying his parents struggled with addictions. But he turned his life around, worked on offshore oil rigs, and purchased hundreds of acres in rural Nova Scotia to build a youth-at-risk facility.

“It was almost like everything about my life he was saying back to me,” Speranza says.

She says she now realizes it wasn’t a chance encounter. He targeted her, she says, using a well-honed script and asking pointed questions to develop a plan.

Story continues below advertisement

It started off very casually – she wasn’t looking for a relationship. But she was attracted to his desire to help youth and to give back to the community.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.

He told her she was beautiful. She made him a better person. She was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was falling hard and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

“Everything was just perfect,” she says. “He was super accommodating and helpful and complimentary. Nothing I could say or do was wrong.”

Speranza now believes he targeted her to invest in his apparently fabricated youth-at-risk facility. When she instead offered to help him apply for grants, she believes he implemented an exit strategy.

He said he suffered from Crohn’s disease and one day he called her to say he’d been hospitalized.

Story continues below advertisement

She recalls him saying he was OK, but his wallet had been stolen. He needed money to buy costly medication. Then he had to go to Toronto to get his dog from his ex, and borrowed money for a train ticket and hotel room. He promised to pay her back.

She gave him $5,000.

“He ghosted me after that,” Speranza says, adding that he never repaid her. “I pride myself on good decisions. But I had no inkling whatsoever.”

She filed a police report and encouraged another alleged victim she met, Jean-Baptiste Joachin, to do the same.

The French citizen had met Vautour at a hostel in Quebec City and had travelled with him to Halifax, where he was promised a job on an offshore rig.

Joachin allegedly paid Vautour thousands of dollars for training courses. He also opened up Canadian bank accounts and credit cards, which Vautour had access to.

Story continues below advertisement

By the time Vautour skipped town last fall, Joachin had lost $30,000.

“He completely blindsided me,” Joachin said.

Halifax police spokesman John MacLeod confirmed the force has received two complaints of fraud based on case file numbers provided to The Canadian Press by Speranza and Joachin. But he said one incident had been closed while the second was deemed a civil matter.

Meanwhile, Speranza has discovered more alleged victims in other provinces through social media. They exchanged photos of the fraudster to confirm his identity, and have shared information about their cases.

Together, they’ve pieced together a string of allegations against Vautour across the country.

The Canadian Press has contacted police forces, court houses and justice departments in several provinces and has confirmed he’s a wanted man with a criminal past.

Story continues below advertisement

Documents obtained from Quebec’s Justice Department show Vautour pleaded guilty in 2005 to unauthorized use of credit card data and received a suspended sentence of one year’s probation.

In 2015, Quebec courts issued an arrest warrant for Vautour for fraud.

Victoria Law Courts confirmed a warrant for the arrest of Vautour was issued in 2001, and executed in 2009. He pleaded guilty in August 2009 to obtaining by false pretense and served a six-month conditional sentence in the community, followed by two and half years of probation.

Meanwhile, West Kelowna RCMP said they are aware of a recent incident and have a police file open on the matter. But spokesman Jesse O’Donaghey said specific details are not released until charges are laid by Crown counsel.

The Winnipeg Police Service confirmed Vautour is currently the subject of two arrest warrants. Const. Rob Carver said the charges pending from 1998 include possession of goods obtained by crime over $5,000 and personation.

Records from the Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick indicate Vautour was charged in 1996 with stealing a Volkswagen Jetta in Dieppe.

Despite efforts by law enforcement, some alleged victims have launched their own investigations – even hiring a private investigator.

They’ve tracked down more than 20 phone numbers, 10 e-mail addresses and multiple physical addresses used by Vautour in Canada and overseas.

The alleged victims have even narrowed down his method.

They say he told them all variations on a theme: He had a successful career either working on offshore rigs, as a remotely operated underwater vehicle operator, or running companies.

He claimed he made it big investing in precious metals, cryptocurrency and cannabis, the alleged victims say. He said he owned a white convertible Porsche, a Ford F-350 truck, a baby blue Aston Martin. He even had pictures to show off his upscale possessions.

“He had money and was well-travelled,” says Jodi McMullin, a woman from the Okanagan area of B.C. who met him on a dating site in January 2018.

The whirlwind romance moved quickly, and they began planning a future together.

He told her he had been working in Vietnam and wanted to stay with her in Canada. But he had tax issues, and needed help cashing a business cheque.

The businesswoman offered to help him out. When she had doubts, he was always ready with an explanation.

“Every time I questioned him on something, he had a response right away,” she says. “There was never any hesitation.”

She provided him with her bank account number, and he deposited a cheque and then pressured her to transfer him the money, she says.

Ashka Dixit, Anushka Dixit, Prerit Dixit, Kosha Vaidya: The family of six from Brampton, Ont., was planning to visit Kosha's birthplace in Kenya, said her brother, Manant Vaidya. He said his 37-year-old sister hadn't visited Kenya for decades. Her daughters, 14-year-old Ashka and 13-year-old Anushka, were looking forward to going on a safari, he said.

The other family members on the trip were 45-year-old father Prerit Dixit, 71-year-old grandfather Pannagesh Vaidya and 63-year-old grandmother Hansini Vaidya.

Kosha moved to Ontario in 2004 after marrying her husband, who already lived in Canada.

The girls were strong students and enrolled in specialized science and technology courses, Manant said. Ashka was also known for her singing voice, while Anushka was talented in dance and was learning a traditional Indian form called khattak.

Prerit worked as a medical lab assistant for LifeLabs and also held a job at Ontario's Ministry of Health. Kosha used to work for the Canadian Hearing Society, said Manant.

Pius Adesanmi: Adesanmi was a Nigerian-born professor in the Department of English Language and Literature and the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa.

He was a ""towering figure in African and postcolonial scholarship,"" said the school's president, Benoit-Antoine Bacon.

Adesanmi was the winner of the inaugural Penguin Prize for African non-fiction writing in 2010.

Mitchell Dick, a Carleton student in communications, said Adesanmi was ""extremely nice and approachable,"" and stood out for his passion for African literature.

Angela Rehhorn: Angela Rehhorn, 24, was an enthusiastic conservation volunteer from Orillia, Ont., who was developing a citizen science project on bat conservation.

The Canadian Wildlife Federation says she had recently participated in its Canadian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program for Canadians ages 18 to 30. She was on her way to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi as part of the UN Association of Canada's Canada Service Corps Program, it said.

Rick Bates, CEO of the Canadian Wildlife Federation, said in an interview that Rehhorn was a well-liked ""outdoors girl"" who was also a great leader.

""She was full of excitement and the optimism of youth and wanting to change the world and work on changing the world. And that's what she was doing,"" Bates said.

Rehhorn recently completed a bachelor of science at Dalhousie University and was ""thrilled"" to take part in the conservation corps, the federation said.

Her experience took her to Alberta where she went backpacking in Kananaskis this fall, then to Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island for her field training. At the time of her death, Rehhorn had just finished volunteering her time to do species surveys and was especially interested in expanding her experience working in the marine environment, the federation said.

Stephanie Lacroix: Stephanie Lacroix was passionate about youth education and life skills development in both Canada and southern Africa.

Lacroix was working with the United Nations Association in Canada to help engage young Canadians in the UN's work to grow global citizens as a project officer with the association's Canada Service Corps, her LinkedIn profile says.

She graduated in 2015 with an honours degree in international development and globalization from the University of Ottawa. She was a board member of the African Community Fund for Education Canada and previously volunteered with Free the Children.

In an interview, Jasveen Brar said she met Lacroix at COP24 in Poland.

Darcy Belanger:

Parvati.org, a not-for-profit conservation group, says the former Edmonton resident was its founding member and director of strategic initiatives.

Belanger's LinkedIn profile says he was working as a United States director of professional development with PCL Construction in Denver. Parvati says Belanger had taken time off from PCL and was travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly.

The organization said he was a champion of the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary because he realized the importance of the Arctic Ocean in balancing global weather patterns. MAPS declares the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle a protected area, the group said in a statement.

""Admired for his courage, outstanding achievements, and noble qualities, Darcy was a hero in every sense of the word,"" Parvati said. ""He was passionately devoted to the protection of all life through the realization of MAPS.""

Micah Messent: Messent was an environmentalist from British Columbia who expressed his joy on social media at being able to attend the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi.

In an Instagram post, he said he had been selected by the United Nations Association of Canada to attend the assembly and was travelling to Kenya where he would ""have the chance to meet with other passionate youth and leaders from around the world and explore how we can tackle the biggest challenges that are facing our generation.""

""I'm so grateful for this opportunity and want to thank all of the people in my life who have helped me get this far.""

Prof. Laurie Meijer Drees taught Messent at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo and said he was committed to being a role model for Indigenous youth and was a trailblazer among his classmates and the faculty.

""He was a bright light among all of those bright lights,"" she said. ""He was very enthusiastic, a bright young scholar, very committed to the environment and the land.""

Drees said Messent was part of a group of about a dozen Indigenous Studies students who wanted to make the world a better place.

The First Nations Leadership Council said Messent was a member of the Red River Métis Nation in Manitoba and was raised as the youngest of five siblings in the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island. It said he had plans to return to school in the future to pursue a law degree.

Peter deMarsh: Described by a longtime family friend in New Brunswick as a dedicated community activist, deMarsh travelled the world as chair of the International Family Forestry Alliance.

The international group, based in Luxembourg, represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide.

Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association in New Brunswick more than a decade ago.

""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them.""

MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community.

""He was warm, funny, passionate — you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community.""

Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the International Family Forestry Alliance, said in an email that police shared the news of deMarsh's death with his family late Sunday.

DeMarsh was en route to Nairobi, where he and Montecuccoli had planned to attend a workshop on financing for small farms.

The CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, Derek Nighbor, issued a statement describing deMarsh as a lifelong advocate for the Canadian forest sector.

Amina Ibrahim Odowaa and her daughter Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir:

The 33-year-old Edmonton woman and her five-year-old daughter were travelling to Kenya to visit relatives. Her brother, Mohamed Hassan Ali of Toronto, said he had planned to travel with them but had to cancel last week.

""(She was) a very nice person, very outgoing, very friendly — had a lot of friends,"" he said.

A family friend said Odowaa had lived in Edmonton since 2006.

Derick Lwugi: An accountant with the City of Calgary, Lwugi was on his way to Kenya to visit both his and his wife's parents.

""His mom was not feeling well,"" Lwugi's wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary.

The couple have three children, aged 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home. The family has lived in Calgary for 12 years.

Lwugi's neighbours in the southeast suburban neighbourhood of Mohogany said they would honour him with a ribbon campaign in the Kenyan flag's colours of red, black and green.

Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said on Twitter he was ""crushed"" by news of Lwugi's death.

Jessica Hyba: Hyba's Facebook page says she was born in Ottawa and pursued a career in international aid work. She worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an public relations officer, based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Prior to that, the UNHCR said Hyba worked for CARE Canada.

That agency issued a statement saying she had worked in Indonesia as part of the emergency response to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.

""We remember her fondly as a dedicated humanitarian and loving mother,"" CARE Canada said on their website.

Danielle Moore: A 24-year-old marine biology student from Winnipeg, Moore graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 2017.

She posted on Facebook on Saturday morning that she would be travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly.

""Over the next week, I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world,"" she wrote.

""I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity.""

Colby Deighton, who dated Moore for four years and was still a friend, said he has many fond memories of her.

""Danielle was fearless, she had an insatiable curiosity and kind of an unbelievable capacity to do whatever she wanted to do,"" he said. ""She was always looking for opportunities and not just for herself, but she would regularly send people job opportunities or ideas that related to her friend's interests or programs they might want to apply to because it reminded her of them.

""She would often tell me that her dream job was to work in a school and be a guidance counsellor.""

Prof. Kim Davies, her honours thesis adviser at Dalhousie, said Moore was an exceptional student.

""She excelled at her studies, she was a kind and friendly person, and she was deeply devoted to environmental and human rights causes,"" Davies said in an email.

Davies said after graduating from Dalhousie, Moore returned to Manitoba where she worked for several non-governmental organizations, including the Canada Learning Code, a group dedicated to improving the accessibility of educational and technological resources for Canadians.

The professor confirmed Moore's work was recognized by the United Nations, which is why she was invited to be a delegate to the environmental assembly.",Remembering the 18 Canadian victims of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9224336-remembering-the-18-canadian-victims-of-the-ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash/

Star speakers include Canadian Green Party leader Elizabeth May.","Links between hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and earthquakes, and predicting and preventing the tremors, remain riddles requiring far more scientific study, according to a report commissioned by the British Columbia (BC) government.

Only 0.3% of fracking and 1% of waste disposal by western Canadian wells since 1985 shook the ground -- and explanations for the cases remain elusive, said the report, “Scientific Review of Hydraulic Fracturing in British Columbia.”

“AIS [anomalous induced seismicity] is observed in clusters and not scattered across a region with active fluid-injection operations,” according to an inquiry panel of three experts from technical specialties involved in natural gas, liquid byproducts and oil extraction.

“Differentiating why certain areas are more susceptible to AIS, understanding the variability within susceptible areas and accurately forecasting whether a fluid-injection operation is susceptible to AIS are key challenges.”

Improved measurements of subterranean rock, water and forces are needed to close fracking knowledge gaps.

“Forecasting whether a specific operation will induce anomalous seismicity requires physics-based modeling with accurate hydro-geomechanical parameters.”

Detection of earth tremors with suspected industry causes has multiplied since 2013, when BC quadrupled to eight the number of its seismic activity observation stations in northern shale drilling regions. Sensitive instruments register even tiny tremors.

BC has linked 129 subterranean tremors to drilling in its richest shale target, the Montney formation. Of four tremors that were strong enough to be felt on the ground surface as earthquakes, two are attributed to fracking injections, one to fluid disposal and one to both types of industry operations.

A single Montney well was associated with two earthquakes last fall and prompted the BC Oil & Gas Commission (BCOGC) to suspend all fracking in the region for a one-month review and improvement of drilling plans.

The inquiry recommends strengthening BCOGC earthquake prevention by requiring assessments of naturally vulnerable underground rock faults for all fracking wells and following an Alberta example of mapping sensitive spots in geological formations.

The fracking report’s account of earthquake knowledge gaps is part of a 236-page recital of technical uncertainties that also covers pollution emissions, health, and water quantity, quality and use issues.

“The very rapid development of shale gas in northeastern B.C. has made it difficult to assure that risks are being adequately managed at every step. Furthermore, the panel could not quantify risk because there are too few data to assess risk.”

But the report adds, “Nevertheless, it is the view of the panel that the current regulations under many acts appear to be robust.”

No fracking ban is recommended. No plans to halt drilling have emerged in the B.C. government, which has granted supportive tax breaks to a CDN$40-billion (US$30-billion) liquefied natural gas export terminal, pipeline and shale supply development now under construction.

An energy ministry statement says a “phased approach” will be adopted to respond to 97 technical recommendations by the fracking report. The ministry says, “Over the last 18 months, government has implemented a number of changes to strengthen the regulatory framework for the oil and gas industry. Much of this work addresses concerns raised by the scientific panel.”

As a textbook on fracking methods, knowledge gaps and uncertainties, the inquiry report became instant ammunition for a environmental protest caravan seeking a B.C. counterpart to bans enacted by Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Free public forums reciting fracking risks are being held in B.C. centers including the provincial capital, Victoria, by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, David Suzuki Foundation, Force of Nature, My Sea to Sky, Sierra Club B.C., Quest University and Watershed Sentinel.

Dubbed the gateway to cottage country in Peterborough & the Kawarthas, Lakefield’s history dates back to the early 19th century. The village was originally founded by Colonel Samuel Strickland (brother of the iconic 19th-century writers Catharine Parr Traill and Susanna Moodie) when he settled in the area in 1831. Before becoming known as Lakefield, the village was previously called Nelson’s, Herriot’s Falls, and then Selby.

This is part three of a three-part series on Canadian getaways in Peterborough & The Kawarthas.

Originally sustained by the saw mill industry, Lakefield is now a prosperous residential community supported by small business, especially retail and tourism, along with international companies including SGS Research and Savage Arms.

A 15-minute drive north of Peterborough, a two-hour drive from Toronto, and a three-hour drive Ottawa, Lakefield’s historic homes and heritage sites, vibrant downtown, and close proximity to many local attractions make it an ideal destination for your next Canadian getaway.

Explore Canada’s literary history

The Village of Lakefield has a rich literary heritage, with two of Canada’s most important 19th-century writers — sisters Catharine Parr Traill and Susanna Moodie — having lived in the area, as well as one of Canada’s most esteemed and beloved writers, the novelist and short-story writer Margaret Laurence.

Born in England almost two years apart, Susanna and Catharine Parr Strickland eventually married, respectively, John Moodie and Thomas Traill. In 1832, both families emigrated to Canada where they settled on adjacent bush farms along the eastern shore of Lake Katchewanooka just north of Lakefield, with the help of their brother Samuel Strickland.

Their experiences as pioneers led to Catharine Parr Traill’s book The Backwoods of Canada (1836) and Susanna Moodie’s book Roughing It in the Bush (1852).

In 1840, Susanna Moodie and her husband moved to Belleville, but she returned to the Lakefield area for a month each summer to visit her sister.

The prior year, the Traills sold their farm and then lived at various locations in Peterborough County until Thomas Traill died in 1859. Following her husband’s death, Catharine had a cottage built in Lakefield with the help of her brother Samuel.

She called it “Westove”, after her husband’s home in the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Except for short absences to visit family and friends, it was Catharine’s home from 1860 until her death in 1899.

Located at 16 Smith Street in Lakefield, it is now a private residence with a historical plaque located beside the home.

One of Canada’s most esteemed literary figures, Margaret Laurence, spent the last 13 years of her life in Lakefield. She is best known for her iconic books The Stone Angel (1964), A Jest of God (1966), and The Diviners (1974).

Called the “First Lady of Lakefield”, Laurence lived at 8 Regent Street in Lakefield from 1974 until her death there in 1987. She also had a cottage on the Otonabee River near Peterborough, where she wrote The Diviners during the summers of 1971 to 1973.

Laurence’s Lakefield home is located near Christ Church (62 Queen St.), a small stone church built in 1853 under the leadership of Samuel Strickland. It now houses the Christ Church Community Museum, which displays important historical artifacts and displays including the Strickland family history and information about Susanna Moodie, Catharine Parr Traill, Margaret Laurence, and 19th-century writer and poet Isabella Valancy Crawford, who also lived in Lakefield.

Christ Church Community Museum is only open to the public in the summer, when Lakefield also hosts the annual Lakefield Literary Festival. The 25th anniversary festival takes place in 2019 from July 13th to 14th.

363,Politics,2019-03-21T04:07:00.0000000Z,"May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada ... One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments ...","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

DVBBS (pronounced “dubs”) is taking the dance world by storm. The Canadian dance duo—composed of brothers Chris Chronicles (born Christopher van den Hoef) and Alexandre (born Alexandre van den Hoef) first caused a storm in 2013 with their smash single “Tsunami.” Since then, they’ve dropped a string of hits including “La La Land,” “Gold Skies” “Not Going Home,” “Parallel Lines” and the No. 1 breakthrough “Angel,” achieving worldwide success and over one billion streams.

The Ontario-born brothers structure their new music around sunny melodies, catchy vocal tracks and feel-good guitars, connecting the dots between trap beats, future house and electro. They have performed with Tiësto, NERVO, Steve Aoki, Martin Garrix, Showtek, Sander Van Doorn, DJ Snake and have played major festivals including Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and Creamfields, among others.

Here, we chat with these haute DJ brothers about the music they’re making—including their latest single with Saro, “Somebody Like You”, how L.A. inspires their sound and what’s next.

You just released your new single “Somebody Like You” with Saro. What else can we expect from you guys this year?

We’ve been going super hard in the studio every day! You can expect a lot of material from us all year.

You’re from Canada, but live in LA. How does the music scene from each place influence your creative process?

Music is so international so we always produce what we like but I would say we have more close friends in Canada so whatever they’re currently vibing to would influence us.

What are your favorite spots: restaurants, shops, etc.?

Erewhon.

Your EP sounds like it’s been inspired a lot by LA. How so specifically?

I guess the weather and costal vibes really capture our soul.

What did you buy yourself as a celebratory present when your first single became such a success?

A new computer and later on, a car.

Is it tough, easy or somewhere in between living, working and touring as brothers?

It’s all we know, we’ve kind of done everything together all our lives. 🤷🏻‍♂️

You just released your new single “Somebody Like You” with Saro. What else can we expect from you guys this year?

I truly believe, any artist in this new age that is a part of the music production, the songwriting, the music videos and is just invested in the brand above everything else…there is a time where reinventing yourself or your sound is key. For us this year is our next chapter. We spent all of 2018 almost plotting, creating for what will be next, and even though there were many road blocks and writer blocks, we are finally so happy to say. That year we released two records, this year we plan to release an album and a few surprises: the stars aligned on many of the upcoming features and records.

You’re from Canada, but live in LA. How does the music scene from each place influence your creative process?

We are so blessed to come from such an insanely talented & beautiful city. Let alone the music scene is absolutely booming in Toronto. I consider it the best of both worlds, and if you can digest the tastes of the east coast and taste of the west coast, then you are golden.

What do you love most about LA?

Weather isn’t weather…it’s just another beautiful day, and although this year was forest fires straight into weeks of rain, that’s when California becomes most beautiful and green. I like that everyone here – underneath all the craziness – there are people just like me with brains exploding with creativity and we all kinda hover around Los Angeles and in these hills. So many amazing singers, producers and artists at all times, all with the drive to make it, showing up to your house to work. I don’t even need to leave my hill anymore to work or create, it’s a beautiful relaxed feeling. Not to mention we have really turned the health kick on around our household and Los Angeles does very well with clean eating and healthy active living.

What are your favorite spots: restaurants, shops, etc.?

Erewhon (most LA) thing to say but at least it’s quality…Chris became a crazy chef this year: he cooks like 2-3 times a day.

Your EP sounds like it’s been inspired a lot by LA. How so specifically?

If you saw what our studio overlooks…we have a spot that can see downtown straight to the ocean, and the inspiration you draw from just working in this room we set up, is incredible.

You’ve performed with top names like Tiesto, Martin Garrix and Steve Aoki. Has anyone given you career advice that resonated? Who, and what was it if so?

Steve has always since day 1 given us any advice we have ever asked. But the best advice I think I was ever given was from a trumpet player from one of my favorite reggae bands in California. When I was 16 he said, “Man, if you want to become a full time musician, your life needs to be 110% music.” And after all these years of figuring out how I could get that last 10% on my 100%, it all started to make so much sense to me. A majority of our sanity and happiness just comes from creating music now, almost like a therapy, and I truly believe I’ve found that 110%. Our everyday revolves around DVBBS, our fans and our next world tours.

What did you buy yourself as a celebratory present when your first single became such a success?

I never owned a car until I bought a G-wagon. Chris and I had our first boss moment with just two cars, cash in duffle bags and drove off of the lot. Probably not the best investment, but you only really live once so why not?

Is it tough, easy or somewhere in between living, working and touring as brothers?

It’s the hardest thing In the world, but the trust is stronger than anything else, and that’s why DVBBS is immortal.

Every week we pull together some great Canadian recipes from Canadian food bloggers around the web featuring one main ingredient or dish. This week, we're featuring a fan favourite everywhere with over 25 ways to make chili!

Chill is a fan favourite all year round. A big pot of steaming, spicy chili warms you up in fall and winter but it's also the perfect topping to your favourite dog or baked potato year round and a tasty side to your bbq in summer. But it gets better...

Chili is a meal prep dream. You can make a big batch any time of year on the stove, in your Instant Pot or slow cooker. Freeze it up in meal sized portions to eat any time of year when you need a quick dinner. But there's more....

Omnivore? Vegetarian? Vegan? No matter what your dietary preferences are there's more than a few chili recipes out there for you! But we're not done yet...

Chili can be as healthy and as economical as you want to make it. Pack it with beans, lentils, and veggies for extra bulk and flavour (and a cheaper cost). Use a leaner animal protein like chicken or turkey if you eat meat. But can we mention one more thing?

It tastes sooooo good!! There's a reason everyone loves it and it's not just because it's healthy, economical or an easy meal to prep. It's because it tastes delicious and you can dress it up (or down) however you like it. Top it with cheese or avocado, green onions, peppers, sour cream, cashew cream, crunch tortilla chips... whatever makes it taste even better to you!

Interesting side note for you: Did you know that competition chili is not allowed to have beans or any other kind of filler in it! It's meat, tomatoes, spices and chili peppers!

But we're not in a competition here so anything goes! To get you started, we've got over 25 chili recipes for you to check out from FBC Members across the country.

His work has also been featured in publications like Vogue and Elle, and he's dressed the likes of Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau, Jennifer Aniston, Jada Pinkett Smith and MTV’s Jessi Cruickshank. It’s safe to say Kitty’s hit the big time!

“It was definitely unexpected. I thought I had someone else’s phone when I woke up the next morning,” she told the publication of the massive wave of interest after she was photographed at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ’s 2018 nuptials, before joking: “I had to turn my notifications off because my phone was going to die… Can I still FaceTime my cat and put it on my Stories?”

There was a massive wave of interest in Kitty after Harry and Meghan’s nuptials. You’ll remember she arrived at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing an emerald green slim-fit dress with a gorgeous floral pattern and co-ordinating hat with netting. Her look, which also included a diamond choker lipstick and red lipstick, went viral and became the talk of royal watchers during and after the wedding.

But things didn’t quiet down after that – far from it. Later that month, Charles Spencer’s daughter was also announced as the new face of high-end jeweller BVLGARI. She was also spotted in an absolutely to-die-for Dolce & Gabbana outfit at the V&A Summer Party later in the year.

The model told HarpersBazaar.com she hasn’t gotten used to her new fame, and said she feels a sense of “not belonging.” She said it’s particularly prominent for her when she takes the runway with the likes of Monica Bellucci, Carla Bruni, Isabella Rossellini, Helena Christensen and Naomi Campbell – something she did in the fall of 2018 for Dolce & Gabbana.

“I do feel like I sort of snuck through the back door and no one’s noticed yet,” she said. “I keep thinking that this is potentially short term and a really exciting moment, so I’m trying to embrace it for what it is. And then when it does end, just being grateful because it was something I never imagined in the first place.”

Kitty said one thing that’s kept her grounded through her newfound fame is her upbringing and close family ties. She told the publication she feels “lucky” to have been raised in South Africa, where she enjoyed time outdoors and lived at a relaxed, serene pace.

Mary Greenwall, Princess Diana’s makeup artist, told HarpersBazaar.com that Kitty’s spirit is remarkably similar to that of her late-aunt: “Diana was so willing and open... as is Kitty. Just sort of free – there’s a sense of freedom with all of them. I think the sense of freedom is actually very important, that then they didn’t feel stifled by their upbringing and their circumstances.”

For now, Kitty told the publication she’d like to continue to focus on her career and on being a role model for young women. “I guess I’m doing these things on my own terms,” she said, particularly of maintaining a healthy sense of self. “I look after myself but I’m not obsessive or unhealthy. If a brand wants to work with me, and think their designs look good on me, then they can give them to me in my size.”

Love could also be in the cards. “I’ve been really lucky. I’ve always had really lovely, straightforward boyfriends,” she said. “Whenever anything exciting happens in my life, or sad, the serious boyfriends I’ve had will be the first to get in touch and the first to be supportive. I don’t see the appeal of going for anyone who’s too complicated or not trustworthy… The men that I’ve been with have been kind and still are. And it’s lovely because it’s like a greater form of friendship in a way.”

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans’ magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to “share completely” her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott’s remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau’s closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

“Until we are able to put this behind us, it’s pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,” Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: “No, we never gave a number.”

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company’s share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

By most accounts, they were members of the last legislative chamber in the Western world to keep TV cameras out.

No more.

As of today, proceedings in the Red Chamber can and will be televised.

The move comes 42 years after the House of Commons let the cameras in.

Many of the senators had resisted because they feared their mandate to supply “sober second thought” would degenerate into partisan politics if cameras appeared.

But in 2016, a committee charged with modernizing the Senate recommended that proceedings in the chamber be televised to show Canadians the “value” of the upper house.

A committee report noted that broadcasting proceedings would demonstrate ‘high quality of debate’ in Red Chamber.”

However, at least for now, senators will not be sharing their sober second thoughts from their long-time lair, the Red Chamber.

Because of major renovation work on Parliament Hill, the Senate is currently housed at the Government Conference Centre.

Once Ottawa’s central train station, the building has been the site of many famous events in Canadian history, including the federal-provincial meetings that led to the repatriation of the Constitution in 1982.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties ...","Regardless of who wins the 2019 provincial election, Alberta has been fundamentally altered by the results of the 2015 election and its aftermath.

This is one of the themes of Orange Chinook, a book I co-edited with my colleagues Keith Brownsey, Richard Sutherland, and David Taras at Mount Royal University.

In several chapters, the book highlights how the last provincial election brought to the fore a number of demographic and political changes that had been bubbling below the surface for years.

Alberta has a reputation as a conservative place, but a progressive evolution has been happening in its largest cities. The 2015 election also saw a breakthrough for women in politics, dramatically shifting what was once a male-dominated landscape. We witnessed, too, the rise of Indigenous activism, an undercurrent that is rising, increasingly, to the surface.

Many of these changes seem permanent, and the net effect appears to be the end of decades-long political dynasties that characterized this province for so long.

In short, Alberta politics is becoming more ""normal"" in the Canadian context.

Toward a two-party system

From 1905 to 2015, Alberta was unique in Canada. It was a province dominated by a single party.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties: Liberals (1905-1921), the United Farmers of Alberta (1921-1935), Social Credit (1935-1971), and the Progressive Conservatives (1971-2015).

Moreover, when the dynasty was finally defeated, it was never really a contender again. The once-dominant party often disappeared entirely.

Alberta PC leader Jim Prentice leaves the stage after election results came in on Tuesday, May 5, 2015, showing the NDP had won a majority, toppling the PC colossus that has dominated the province for more than four decades. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

The 2015 election replicated this pattern. After their defeat, the PCs voted themselves out of existence when they merged with the Wildrose Party to form the new United Conservative Party.

But the situation is now different. If the UCP wins the 2019 election, as polls currently suggest, it's unlikely to govern for 44 years. And the NDP is unlikely to disappear.

Instead, Alberta is moving toward a two-party system, with the NDP on the left and the UCP on the right. With this structure, it more closely resembles the political landscape in other Canadian provinces.

Alberta has never had a party lose power and then come back and win another election. But that day is coming.

And the path to victory for any party, increasingly, runs through Alberta's largest cities.

The rise of cities

Rural Alberta had been the political bedrock of previous political dynasties, but the election of the NDP in 2015 was remarkable for its lack of a powerful rural minister in the vein of Hugh Horner, Marv Moore, Ken Kowlaski or Ed Stelmach.

The NDP, despite winning a handful of rural seats, was widely seen as ""the party of cities,"" as James Wilt describes it in one chapter of the book.

Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, given the success of progressive candidates at a municipal level.

In the case of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, Dave Bronconnier, Al Duerr, and even a young Ralph Klein could not be described as either fiscal or social conservatives. The situation was the same in Edmonton with Don Iveson, Stephen Mandel, Bill Smith, and Jan Reimer.

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson and Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi share the stage at at the University of Alberta for the 10th annual Hurtig Lecture. (CBC)

The longevity of the Progressive Conservative dynasty at a provincial level masked changes that were already underway in Alberta's two biggest cities.

For Roger Epp, who contributed another chapter to Orange Chinook, the fiasco over the NDP's farm workers bill and some insensitive remarks about the carbon tax showed a government that was, in his words, ""post-rural.""

The 2015 election, in Epp's view, put the electoral stamp on a number of trends that had been occurring in rural Alberta: a declining population, the increasing encroachments of urban life, the loss of health and education services, and the rural way of life quickly fading.

Indeed, the percentage of MLAs from rural Alberta has been in a slow but steady decline as urban and suburban populations grow. As recently as 2001, less than half of MLAs came from Calgary and Edmonton. For the 2019 election, when the suburbs are included, it will be two-thirds.

And in both 2012 and 2015, rural MLAs were mostly on the opposition side of the legislature. If the UCP forms government in 2019, a majority of rural MLAs will be back on the government side. But this will not bring back the political glory days. Those days are gone.

So too, are the days of politics being a man's game.

Alberta steps into the future

When Alison Redford won the PC leadership race in 2011, the Globe and Mail carried a notoriously condescending front-page headline: ""Alberta steps into the present.""

But as Lori Williams shows in her chapter comparing the leadership styles of Danielle Smith, Alison Redford, and Rachel Notley, Albertans have had several women succeed in a hitherto masculine environment.

These changes are permanent.

It was Notley — not Justin Trudeau — who introduced the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada.

Meanwhile the UCP, which had been mocked for having more men in its caucus named Richard than it did women, has nominated dozens of women to run in 2019.

The days of Alberta politics being so heavily male-dominated are over.

A final demographic change is the rise of Indigenous political activism.

Indigenous votes

Brad Clark, in his chapter of Orange Chinook, demonstrates the NDP was overwhelmingly supported by Indigenous people in the 2015 election.

In fact, there were three ridings that were significantly impacted by First Nations and Métis votes: Lesser Slave Lake, Peace River, and Wetaskiwin-Camrose.

The potential for clashes over energy infrastructure, environmental considerations, revenue sharing, and the constitutionally mandated duty to consult means future Alberta governments need to respond to Indigenous people.

There are those who believe that the election of the NDP was an accident and that Alberta is really an ideologically conservative province going back to the Social Credit days.

But is that true?

Politics in the new Alberta

The concluding chapter by Anthony Sayers and David Stewart — using post-election survey data from 2008, 2012, and 2015 — shows that notion is more myth than reality.

On most questions of political values, they write, ""stereotypes notwithstanding, voters in Alberta appear broadly supportive of a substantial role for the state with respect to government spending.""

This was also replicated by a spring 2018 survey for CBC by Janet Brown and John Santos, who co-wrote a chapter on polling in the book.

The chapter on the fiscal situation in Alberta, written by Ron Kneebone and Jennifer Zwicker, provides more evidence that Albertans are not particularly fiscally conservative. In reality, they say, we like high government spending and low taxes.

For decades, Albertans could get away with that because the gap between revenue and expenses was covered by rich oil and gas royalties. When those royalties decline, as they did in 2015, budget deficits occur.

Whoever wins the 2019 election will need to make some hard choices to address Alberta's fiscal situation.

The titular Orange Chinook refers to the winds of change that carried the NDP to victory in 2015. But chinooks can be temporary. We could see the government voted out of office in 2019.

However, as the sub-title indicates — Politics in the New Alberta — what we witnessed four years ago represents a much more durable shift than just a change of governing parties.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, seeking to move past a political crisis threatening its re-election, lavished new spending on middle-class voters in its budget on Tuesday as it forecast a bigger fiscal deficit of C$19.8 billion in 2019-20.

The budget contained spending measures that could lift gross domestic product by 0.2 percent this year, which is “not enough to move the dial on Bank of Canada policy,” Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.

The market has shifted from expecting further rate hikes from the Bank of Canada, which has tightened 125 basis points since July 2017, to seeing potential for a rate cut as data showed a slowdown in the country’s economy.

Canada said on Tuesday it would issue nearly 20 percent more bonds in the coming fiscal year to help the Liberal government fund its spending programs.

At 9:31 a.m. (1331 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3321 to the greenback, or 75.07 U.S. cents. The currency traded in a range of 1.3316 to 1.3345.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to hold interest rates steady, shave the number of hikes projected for the rest of the year, and release long-awaited details of a plan to end the monthly reduction of its massive balance sheet.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, was dragged down by concerns about global economic growth as the U.S.-China trade dispute rumbled on, but receiving some support from tightened supply. U.S. crude oil futures were down 0.3 percent at $58.86 a barrel.

Canadian government bond prices were little changed across the yield curve, with the 10-year rising 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.725 percent.

Kevin Chan, head of public policy in Canada for Facebook, says the company is trying to exceed the standards the Canadian law sets. ""C-76 is, in fact, very ...","OTTAWA — Facebook is launching a new advertisement library that will capture detailed information about political ads targeted at voters in Canada, including who pays for them and whom they target.

The move is part of the social-media giant's response to changes the Trudeau government has made to Canada's election laws aimed at stopping bad actors — foreign or domestic — from interfering with Canada's upcoming federal election through advertising.

Bill C-76, which received royal assent in December, bans the use of money from foreign entities to conduct partisan campaigns.

It also requires online platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to create a registry of all digital advertisements placed by political parties or third parties during the pre-writ and writ periods and to ensure they remain visible to the public for two years.

Google recently said the demands of the new law are too onerous for its advertising system, which auctions ad space on the fly. It's simply refusing to take political advertisements in Canada around the upcoming election.

Kevin Chan, head of public policy in Canada for Facebook, says the company is trying to exceed the standards the Canadian law sets.

""C-76 is, in fact, very important and consequential legislation. It actually regulates online platforms, including Facebook,"" Chan said. ""In order to comply we actually need to build new systems and new products to be able to do this, so right now we have our product-engineering teams working very, very hard between now and the end of June to ensure that we will be in compliance with what C-76 requires.""

Advertisements that refer to political figures, political parties, elections, legislation or issues of national importance will have to go through an authorization process. This will capture the information of the entity or group buying the ad and ensure the buyer is based in Canada.

Political ads that appear on Facebook during the pre-writ and writ periods will be labelled with a ""paid for by"" disclosure. People will be able to click the disclosure and see the ad library. This library will include information on the ad's reach — who saw it, their gender and location, as well as a range of its impressions.

Information in the library will be viewable and searchable online for up to seven years, which exceeds the period required in the new election laws.

Another effort to exceed the legislative rules will see Facebook using its artificial-intelligence technologies and algorithms to detect ads or content that tries to circumvent the rules.

""We recognize that there's going to probably be the potential for bad actors to try to work around the system — in other words, they may want to run a political ad and not seek to self-declare and not seek to be authorized,"" Chan said. ""That is obviously problematic for us because we recognize that the spirit of what Parliament intended and what we intend, in terms of what we're trying to do, is provide the most transparency for political ads as possible.""

To help Facebook predict what issues might become key points of debate in the federal election, the company has amassed an group of policy advisers from a wide range of political backgrounds and expertise.

The group includes: former NDP MP Megan Leslie; former Stephen Harper aide Ray Novak, who is the managing director of Harper and Associates; Antonia Maioni, McGill University's dean of arts; Ry Moran, executive director of the truth and reconciliation centre at the University of Manitoba; and David Zussman, a professor at the University of Victoria's school of public administration.",Facebook announces changes to political advertising to meet new federal rules,Pique Newsmagazine,https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/facebook-announces-changes-to-political-advertising-to-meet-new-federal-rules/Content?oid=13452275

“What we’ve discovered is that in the determination to diversify our audiences, the only success is if we deliver work from underrepresented communities. We’re really making a commitment to that in our programming this year,” says Eric Coates, the GCTC’s artistic director.

The 2019-20 season consists of five plays — all of which were hits when they were staged elsewhere in recent years, Coates says — plus a key role in a new 11-day festival.

From Sept. 12 to 22, the GCTC will be the home base for the Prismatic Arts Festival, which, in line with Coates’s priorities, focuses on Indigenous and culturally diverse artists. The multi-disciplinary festival, which has run in Halifax since 2008, features not only theatre, but also dance, music, spoken word, visual arts, film and media arts.

Prismatic’s artistic director in Halifax “wants to create a stronger international presence for it. He believes Ottawa is the right place, and we’ve agreed to be the home for this pilot project of bringing it to Ottawa,” Coates says.

When Prismatic takes place in Ottawa, its presentations will happen at a mix of venues. The festival’s events at the GCTC will not be included in the GCTC’s subscription series.

The season’s first play is Bang Bang, which manages to tackle the charged issues of police violence, race, appropriation of voice and mental illness as “a very provocative comedy,” Coates says. The play by Toronto-based playwright Kat Sandler was staged in early 2018 at Toronto’s Factory Theatre. Its GCTC run will be from Oct. 22 to Nov. 10.

Cottagers and Indians, another comedy that premiered in Toronto in early 2018, comes to the GCTC Nov. 26 to Dec. 15.

Indigenous playwright Drew Hayden Taylor’s play is all about the interaction of two characters in central Ontario, an Indigenous farmer and a white female cottager, who are at odds after the farmer plants wild rice on the lake shore. “They have this running dialogue about how unreasonable these people are being,” Coates says. Hayden Taylor “writes with an extreme playfulness about very serious conflicts in society,” Coates adds.

The GCTC’s first presentation of 2020 is a unique play called Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools, which pairs Inuk artist Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory and queer theatre-maker Evalyn Parry. The two women had met on an Arctic expedition from Iqaluit to Greenland and the play that has arisen from their encounter addresses the meeting of Northern and Southern cultures in Canada. The play, which also features the accompaniment of two-spirit Cree cellist Cris Derksen, runs from Jan. 22 to Feb. 9 next year. It will be presented at the GCTC thanks to a partnership with the National Arts Centre’s Indigenous Theatre department.

Next spring will see the Canadian premiere of the play Daisy. It was written by Ottawa-based playwright Sean Devine but it premiered in 2016 in Seattle, where it received a Gregory Award nomination for outstanding new play and a Broadway World Seattle Critic’s Choice Award for best new play.

Devine’s play is based on the story behind the creation of the first modern political attack ad, a short clip known as the “Daisy ad” that was in support of Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 presidential campaign. The ad aired just once and then was banned because of the controversy that erupted. “It really rocked convention,” Coates says. “It set the stage for what we’re seeing as the signature of U.S. politics bleeding over to Canadian politics.”

Devine’s play, Coates says, is “is very much like an episode of Mad Men, taken out of that era and environment.” It will run from Mar. 10 to 29 next year.

Concluding the season will be the play Unholy, by Toronto playwright Diane Flacks. The play, which runs from April 21 to May 10 next year, features a debate of the question “Should women abandon religion?,” pitting a former nun and an atheist on the yea side versus a Muslim lawyer and a Jewish scholar.

The witty, provocative play also features a male moderator — “We wish him all the best,” Coates says. He adds that when he saw Unholy staged in Toronto, discussions would inevitably ensue after the play, and that the play drew a strikingly young audience.

Typically the GCTC’s season features the world premieres of one or two plays. However, for the 2019-20 season, “for a number of reasons we just didn’t have anything that was really ready to go,” Coates says.

He says he’ll be pleased nonetheless to see how the upcoming season’s plays will resonate with Ottawa viewers. “I suddenly found myself looking at my short list of plays, and I realized what a great test this would be to see how Ottawa responds to work, compared to other markets. I believe we really do have regional tastes.”

Coates added that “giving local artists a shot at plays that have a proven track record, that have some star quality to them, escalates everybody’s excitement in a different way.”

In Canada, there are 338 members of parliament, 751 members of provincial and territorial legislatures and some 25,000 municipal councillors and mayors. Add to that the number of people who ran for office but were not elected, and Max Cameron, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), says there are currently more than 75,000 people across the country who are actively thinking about entering politics.

But Cameron believes that number could be higher, and its cohort more diverse, if only Canadians had a better understanding of the entry points and inner-workings of politics.

“There are so many good people who would never go into politics because they don’t find it appealing. They’re deterred by the idea of living in a fish bowl where everyone is looking at you or not wanting to deal with the attacks,” says Cameron. “But without those good people, it’s affecting the way our institutions are functioning.”

With this in mind, through the CSDI, the University of British Columbia launched a non-partisan “boot camp” in 2013 that teaches participants about the day-to-day life of Canadian politicians at the federal, provincial and city level, as well as experimenting with new concepts to improve our democratic institutions.

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson (IFLR), a program modelled after CSDI’s boot camp. Applications are now open and are due by April 1. The program, which costs $1,200, runs over three weekends in May and June and is open to anyone.

Unlike most professions, there’s no concrete training for politicians. The boot camp prepares the participants for the real world of politics, from learning the basics of parliamentary practices and procedures, to how to answer media questions, to how to pass legislation and work with other political parties. The participants also get advice from elected officials, scholars and political journalists who offer mentorship and share their experiences. So far, former NDP MP Peggy Nash and journalist Martin Regg Cohn are confirmed for the Ryerson program.

During the final weekend, participants will head to Ottawa for a mock parliamentary session at the House of Commons. The students will break into political parties, run caucus meetings and try to pass legislation, while also keeping up to date on breaking news and fielding questions from journalists.

Although some of the UBC program’s alumni have gone onto become politicians – like Heather Sweet who was elected to Alberta’s legislature, and Allison Patton, who is on Surrey’s city council – others have gone onto become elected officials in unions or as civil servants. “Whether a participant decides to run afterwards or not, they’ll know much better what the job of a parliamentarian entails,” says Cameron.

Hailey Graham participated in the UBC program in 2013 with political aspirations. “Politics is definitely for me and I think the Institute helped me realize it’s not for me right now, but one day,” says Graham, who is currently in law school in Vancouver.

One of the most enlightening experiences for Graham was learning how to become more self-reflective, something that’s prompted by the instructors throughout the program.

“One of my passions is to have more women in politics, so part of the reflective piece for me was thinking, ‘Who’s taking up space?’ or ‘Who is putting themselves forward into leadership positions right away?’ and ‘How do those people end up getting elected?’” says Graham. “The boot camp highlights those inconsistencies [between different groups of people].”

Cameron says integrating the self-reflective element – something the CSDI picked up from UBC’s medical school – is a way for participants to become better politicians. “It gives them the tools to listen, be more empathetic, find common ground and be able to work with people across party lines,” he says.

Instructors at both Ryerson and UBC’s programs believe that the boot camp is also an opportunity to help elevate groups who have historically been underrepresented in politics, like women, people of colour and LGBTQ- communities.

“For people who haven’t had a political voice or have been marginalized, [IFLR] helps them find ways in which they can articulate their own concerns and do it in the legislature,” says Pamela Sugiman, dean of Ryerson’s Faculty of Arts.

Cameron agrees.

“If you don’t encourage the people who are underrepresented to acquire the skills to be effective statespeople, then politics will be dominated by the same families and social classes as always. Part of our hope for the boot camp is to encourage more inclusion.”

There's more here than meets the eye. If there isn't, this is the most incredibly incompetent, misguided ...","Politics can be unforgiving. Politicians come and go. The sepia state does not.

Let's be clear. The SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal runs deep and is not limited to one event involving Muammar Gaddafi and Libya. As Chrystia Freeland, our foreign minister, is fond of saying, we are punching well above our weight on this one.

It's been a while since a scandal has covered so many bases. If you are an identity politics aficionado, this imbroglio covers women, Indigenous peoples, Québec sovereignty and Alberta outrage.

Depending on your perspective, the prime minister, in one fell swoop, has wrecked his feminist bona fides by firing a female cabinet minister for standing up to him, hobbled his Indigenous reconciliation initiatives because she is also Aboriginal, and been disproportionately concerned about jobs in Québec, which means he obviously cares little for jobs in Alberta.

Much of this is a stretch but understandable given the prime minister's proclivity for announcing with regularity his immaculate conception (free from original sin). It turns out Justin is normal. He has a temper (a piker compared to Paul Martin); has poor people skills when he doesn't get his way, not unlike his ex-attorney general; seems highly motivated to get re-elected; and is prepared to do weaselly things if necessary (a rank amateur compared to Stephen Harper, who prorogued Parliament conveniently more than once).

The real problem with Justin is that he isn't authentic. That's why he is suffering so much.

Let's compare him to Donald Trump. Trump is a crook, a misogynist, a compulsive liar, intellectually lazy, uninterested in public policy, a bully and not very smart. He continues to be popular with 40 to 45 per cent of the American people.

Let's compare him to Doug Ford. Doug Ford got caught trying to put his unqualified friend in charge of the OPP because he wanted a big-screen TV in his van and someone to talk to when he travelled. When confronted with the obvious, he hid from Question Period for days, and when he came back he started screaming about the opposition playing politics with his decisions. Crazy, really, but I doubt he's paid any serious popularity price.

The reason is that just like Trump, Ford is authentic. He is who he is and doesn't pretend to be something else.

More concerning with this scandal is the behaviour of Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council. He's chippy and defensive. And what's this business about not wearing a wire? Too much Netflix?

In America, this is called the deep state. In Canada, let's call it the sepia state. Very interesting: the current top civil servant in the land is taking calls from the former top civil servant in the land (Kevin Lynch), who happens to be the chair of SNC-Lavalin. The appointment of Mr. Lynch on Jan. 1, 2018 was no doubt made with that call in mind, given Kevin brings no serious experience otherwise to chair a multibillion-dollar engineering company.

I met Mr. Lynch in the mid-’90s a couple of times (not alone) when the magazine industry was fighting an American attempt to dismantle our cultural laws protecting national magazines. I was on the road with John Tory, who was president of Rogers Media at the time. More arresting than Kevin Lynch was a call John took at the corner of Wellington and Metcalf. It was from Joe Clark. He was the newly installed leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, for the second time, and he was calling John to see if he could scare up some airline points so he could actually fly around the country. The party was broke and John had the best Conservative Rolodex.

Politics can be unforgiving. Politicians come and go.

The sepia state does not.

My hunch is that the Liberals led by Michael Wernick are more worried what witnesses in any upcoming trial will have to say about who else is involved in the payoff trail than any job loss in Québec. Remember: where international Canadian companies go, so goes the federal government (Export Development Bank, etc.).

There's more here than meets the eye. If there isn't, this is the most incredibly incompetent, misguided, amateurish meltdown of a federal government in living memory.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans’ magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to “share completely” her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott’s remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau’s closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

“Until we are able to put this behind us, it’s pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,” Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: “No, we never gave a number.”

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company’s share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

Sexism is still obviously persistent in politics and ...,"A lot of things have changed in this country since Brian Mulroney was its Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, namely that it's no longer OK to call a female politician a ""little girl""— unless of course she is a little girl.

Stranger things have happened. In 2012, a 3-year-old boy named Bobby Tufts was appointed mayor of the tiny tourist town of Dorset, Minn., when his name was drawn from a hat at a town fair.

Amanda Simard, however, is not 3 years old, nor was her name drawn from a hat. She is an elected official and an adult.

Unfortunately Brian Mulroney didn't treat her like one on Sunday. The former PM participated in an interview on Radio Canada's Toute le monde en parle, where he went to bat for Ontario's Francophone Affairs Minister, Caroline Mulroney, a.k.a. his daughter.

""Caroline is always there to defend the interests of francophones in Ontario,"" Brian Mulroney said on the program in French.

He said this because last year the Ontario Progressive Conservatives came under fire for eliminating the province's French language commissioner and for cancelling plans to build a French language university.

Simard, herself a representative of a heavily French-speaking riding, was so displeased with these cuts, she left the PC caucus to sit as an independent. It was an action some Canadians regarded as brave and principled.

Brian Mulroney, presumably, was not one of them. In the interview in question he described Simard like this: ""la petite fille qui a démissionné est partie."" Translation: ""the little girl who resigned has left.""

As far as sexist barbs go, it's certainly an odd one, considering that Mulroney made it in a direct attempt to defend his daughter — a powerful female leader who no doubt has come up against similar sexist stupidity during her time in office, and who no doubt wasn't a fan of it.

It's hard to believe that Caroline Mulroney is pleased with her dad right now, whose remarks suggest he thinks she is as much a little girl as Simard is; a little girl who needs her father to fight her battles in the media.",Emma Teitel: Brian Mulroney should leave politics to the ‘little girls’ of the world who can handle it,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9229576-emma-teitel-brian-mulroney-should-leave-politics-to-the-little-girls-of-the-world-who-can-handle-it/

Part of the British strategy for ...","“Jewish” used to be considered a religious category. However, for many Jews, that is changing. Increasingly, people who live outside of Israel and identify as Jewish think of themselves as members of an ethnic or cultural group.

For years, researchers have expressed concern that Jewish communities would assimilate and dissipate as religious identification waned. They pointed to intermarriage as an indicator of declining community cohesiveness. For example, they found that in the U.S., half of Jews who are married or in a common law relationship are partnered with non-Jews.

A recent survey reveals that something different is happening in Canada.

A shift from religious identification toward ethnic and cultural identification is taking place. However, the expected assimilation and dissipation of the community is less evident. The intermarriage rate in Canada is less than half that in the United States.

Our family certainly did not follow the path that many researchers anticipated. We got married in 1987. Rhonda converted to Judaism. Our three girls attended full-time Jewish schools. They became fluent in Hebrew to varying degrees. All of them partnered with Jewish men.

While we are both secular in orientation, Rhonda insists that we attend synagogue on occasion. She is the major force behind the organization of activities and preparation of family meals to celebrate Jewish holidays.

We often wondered how common our story is. As senior sociologists in neighbouring Canadian universities, we decided to find out.

Last year we conducted a survey based on a representative sample of 2,335 Canadian Jewish adults in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver – home to 84 per cent of the Canadian Jewish population of about 392,000. Several surprises awaited us.

A strong community

The biggest news coming out of the survey is that the Canadian Jewish community remains highly cohesive. A much higher percentage of Canadian Jews than American Jews make financial donations to the Jewish community, send their children to full-time Jewish school, belong to a synagogue or other type of Jewish organisation and are strongly emotionally attached to Israel. Yet a smaller percentage of Canadian Jews than American Jews believes in God or a higher spirit and thinks that Jewishness is solely a matter of religion.

It is especially among young adults that the religious basis of Jewishness seems to be weakening.

When asked to report whether being Jewish is, for them, mainly a matter of religion, culture or ancestry, young adults are less likely than older adults to choose religion alone.

For these young people, Jewishness is often expressed in their community involvement. Younger Jews are about as active as older Jews on most indicators of community involvement. They are more likely to belong to a Jewish organisation other than a synagogue, light Sabbath candles weekly and donate to Jewish causes.

However, for them, such practices seem to be chiefly a means of achieving conviviality in the family and, beyond that, solidarity with the larger Jewish community.

One interpretation of these findings is that Canadian Jews, particularly young adults, are finding ways of remaining Jewish that are not principally religious. A shift away from religious identification is taking place in other Jewish diaspora communities too, but its replacement by community involvement does not seem to be happening to the same extent.

Canadian exceptionalism?

There are three main reasons why community involvement is substantially stronger in Canada than in the United States.

First, immigration has been proportionately stronger in Canada than in the U.S. since the Second World War. Consequently, 30 per cent of Canadian Jews are immigrants compared to just 14 per cent of American Jews. Canadians therefore tend to have stronger ties to “old country” traditions and languages than do American Jews.

Second, American Jews developed a stronger national identity than Canadians did, partly because the U.S. was settled earlier and therefore had more time for a national identity to crystallize. In addition, American national identity was forged in an anti-colonial war (always a great unifier), while Canadian national identity emerged gradually with the peaceful evolution of independence from Great Britain.

Zionism, the movement to establish a Jewish homeland, appeared on the scene in the late 19th century. It conflicted with American patriotism, particularly for Reform Jews, members of the country’s largest Jewish denomination. Most Reform Jews thought Jewishness should be based on religion, not a national movement.

Not so in Canada, where the Reform movement was weak. By the beginning of the First World War, Zionism was a core element of Jewish identity for the great majority of Canadian Jews. It thus helped to keep the forces of assimilation at bay. It did so by providing a new basis for Jewish identification that became even more compelling after the Holocaust.

The third main reason for Canadian-Jewish exceptionalism is that, out of political necessity, fostering the growth of ethnic institutions has been Canadian public policy since the British conquest of New France in 1760.

Part of the British strategy for dominating the French population was not to quash French Catholic culture, but to help the conservative Catholic Church maintain religious, educational and cultural control.

Two centuries later, shortly after Canada was proclaimed a bilingual and bicultural country, numerous ethnic groups objected that they, too, deserve official recognition and funding. The era of multiculturalism had arrived. For the past half century, strong state support for ethnic institutions has helped all Canadians, Jews among them, to ward off assimilation.

American and Canadian Jews do not differ in all respects. One similarity is the tendency for older Jews in both countries to be more likely than younger Jews to say that caring for Israel is an essential part of being Jewish.

A similar difference between young and old shows up in both countries when Jews are asked about the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Younger Jews are more likely to regard them as illegal by international law. If younger North American Jews are less emotionally attached to Israel than are older members of the community, that may be because they are more likely to disagree with Israel’s policy on the construction of West Bank settlements.

One in three often experience discrimination

Finally, we note a discontinuity of outlook between Canadian Jews and non-Jews.

One in three Canadian Jews believe that Jews often experience discrimination in Canada. In contrast, just one in eight members of the Canadian population at large shares that opinion.

This difference may be due largely to the tendency of non-Jewish Canadians to think of discrimination as mainly a socio-economic phenomenon, while Jewish Canadians tend to think of anti-Jewish discrimination as an ideological matter.

Canadian Jews are not underprivileged. About 80 per cent of Jewish adults between the ages of 25 and 64 have at least a bachelor’s degree. That compares to about 30 per cent of people in that age cohort in the population at large.

However, when Jews think of anti-Jewish discrimination, they have in mind being called offensive names, being snubbed in social settings or being criticized for supporting the existence of a Jewish state.

Of course, we cannot be completely certain of the validity of our findings.

For example, although our generalizations about the relationship between age and community involvement apply across the entire age range, we found it comparatively difficult to recruit 18-to-29-year-old respondents.

It is therefore possible that the youngest cohort in our sample overrepresents highly involved individuals. In that case, the most important relationship we discovered may be a bit weaker than we report. Only more research can discover whether that is the case.

The Canadian dollar is trading in Toronto very close to where it left off yesterday. FX markets were very quiet overnight with traders adopting a cautious stance ahead of this afternoon’s highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee meeting.



The Canadian dollar had a great morning on Tuesday but a ""not-so-great"" afternoon. West Texas Intermediate oil prices climbed to $59.52 U.S./barrel, and the U.S. dollar was trading softer against the G-10 major currencies. The loonie rallied and broke through 100-day moving average resistance but could not drive above the 75.47-cent level against the U.S. dollar.



U.K. political developments took a toll on positive risk sentiment after the Speaker of the House ruled against allowing Prime Minister Theresa May to table her Brexit deal for a third vote. He insisted it needs to be substantially different which force the PM to seek an Article 50 extension from the European Union. Her letter to that effect is expected to be delivered today.



Those developments and the E.U.’s less than warm welcome to the news pressured GBP/USD overnight. GBP/USD opened at 1.3225, after trading in a $1.3270 to $1.3214 range, and then dropped further in Toronto trading, touching $1.3192, after Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded a confirmation referendum on a Brexit deal.



Today’s release of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting policy statement updated economic and interest rate forecasts and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference gave the US dollar a bit of support in Europe and Asia. The Fed is expected to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged but nudge their ""dot-plot"" forecasts lower. In December, the “dot-plot"" anticipated two rate hikes in 2019. Today’s forecast is expected to show just one. Even so, it still leaves the Fed as the only major G-10 central bank with a tightening bias. The rest are neutral and some, like the Bank of Canada, and Reserve Bank of Australia, could be forced to cut rates.



The selloff in WTI oil prices was due to profit taking ahead of today’s Fed meeting as well and concern about the state of the U.S./China trade talks. A Bloomberg article said China was stepping back from earlier trade concessions even as Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are heading to China next week. Those jitters were an excuse to take profit and undermined the Canadian dollar in the process.



The Canadian government released its 2019 budget. It plans a $22.7-billion spending spree to buy votes ahead of the October election but the news did not impact the Canadian dollar.



The economic calendar is empty, and traders will bide their time until the FOMC meeting concludes at 2:00 p.m. EDT.

Amy Smart, The Canadian Press





VANCOUVER -- A marine mammal scientist in Vancouver says he thinks his work has been misrepresented online and he's worried it's part of a trend that has him and his colleagues questioning whether they should talk to media at all in the era of ""fake news.""

""We've got groups that perhaps don't understand the science but they hear a little piece of science that fits with their own narrative, so they grab onto that,"" said Andrew Trites, who oversees the marine mammal unit at the University of British Columbia.

""The truth doesn't matter as much as hearing something that works to support your cause.""

Trites said a Washington state advocacy group called Save Family Farming recently posted a story alongside a slide from a presentation he gave on the endangered southern resident killer whales.

Trites said the slide shows population changes over a 45-year period, which show four different periods of decline, but could be used to illustrate an overall positive trend.

Save Family Farming's post specifically says the data doesn't mean the whales are safe and adds that Trites and other experts believe the prognosis for the species is not very positive.

But Trites said many people could glance at the page and reach the wrong conclusion. It's a dangerous graph to show in isolation because so many people just read headlines and look at the visuals without reading the story or context.

""The image is very powerful,"" he said.

Gerald Baron, executive director of Save Family Farming, said the organization fairly and accurately represented Trites' position. The post lists many of the challenges the whales face.

""Obviously you can't put in the headline what the whole story was, but I think we were very careful when we show the chart that this is one of a series of increases and declines,"" he said. ""I think the entire message of it was, these whales are in trouble but they're in trouble due to a number of factors.""

Trites said he became aware of the piece about a month ago, but did not reach out to the publication.

David Shiffman, a marine biologist with Simon Fraser University, said he has heard many colleagues gripe about the media's representation of science and believes basic media training for scientists could help solve the problem.

""When they explain the situation to me and exactly what happened, it could have been avoided if they had a little more familiarity with common media practices and the differences in culture between journalists and scientists,"" he said.

Shiffman has a study underway analysing media and discourse and says the problem isn't getting better.

With the decline of the science beat, Shiffman said scientists can't assume they are speaking with someone with a science background.

""What we can do is get scientists more familiar with how to effectively communicate their results to journalists and we can encourage media outlets to continue to hire and retain specialty journalists who know their stuff,"" he said.

Thomas Sisk, a professor of environmental science and policy at Northern Arizona University, has also studied the issue.

Beyond media coverage, he said science is not getting the attention it should in political decisions.

""I see a sort of despair that's created by the lack of attention to science generally and the lack of attention when science really does have something to offer in terms of a policy issue,"" he said.

As an example, he said he was surprised to see Prime Minister Justin Trudeau say the government's decision to back the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project was based on ""rigorous debate on science and evidence.""

Sisk said he submitted a peer-reviewed paper to Trudeau's office on the potential impacts of oilsands on the marine environment and never heard back. A journalist later shared documents obtained through a freedom of information request showing discussion of his work between officials with Natural Resources Canada.

""That seemed to me to clearly indicate that our work had been received, considered, distributed within government and their replies were basically as to how they were going to counter it rather than how to take it into account,"" he said.

Vanessa Adams, press secretary for Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi, didn't not respond directly to questions about Sisk's comments.

""Our government has been clear that our decisions on projects would be based on science, evidence, and traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples, and that the views of the public and affected communities will be sought and considered,"" Adams said in a statement.

Sisk said he doesn't expect decisions to be made solely on science because values have to come into play too. But he does hope that peer-reviewed science directly related to an issue of public importance will at least get a fair hearing.

""With the oilsands, the politicization of that has overwhelmed the science, which is unfortunate,"" he said. ""People want to claim the mantle of science to justify a policy decision, and that seems to undermine the role of science in decision-making and policy making.""",Why Canadian scientists are worried about being victims of 'fake news',CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/why-canadian-scientists-are-worried-about-being-victims-of-fake-news-1.4345432

Journalism programs from postsecondary schools across Canada have joined together to create J-Schools Canada, an organization meant to promote Canadian journalism education and collaboration among programs.

Susan Harada, associate director of Carleton University’s school of journalism and communications, spearheaded its creation. She said the idea for the organization came from a few journalism educators during a Canadian Communication Association conference a few years ago. She credits Ivor Shapiro, associate dean of undergraduate education and student affairs at Ryerson University’s faculty of communication and design, with first proposing the professional network.

“At a time when journalism is being challenged, Ivor thought that we should try to make some kind of pan-Canadian … organization that would bring journalism schools together,” Ms. Harada said.

According to Charles Hays, program coordinator for Thompson Rivers University’s journalism program and a member of J-Schools’ interim organizing committee, this new network is the first Canadian organization to do that.

Before J-Schools Canada “there wasn’t an organization that really spoke to, or for, or about Canadian journalism education,” Dr. Hays said. He noted that up until now, journalism educators would meet at the Canadian Communication Association conference once a year and then part ways.

He said it’s especially important for journalism educators to have cross-country connections to identify common issues across programs while also respecting different legal, political and cultural contexts found across provinces and regions.

“Our students go and work all over Canada and if we just teach them our own regional perspective, I don’t think we’re serving them well,” Dr. Hays said.

For Mark Hamilton, chair of the journalism and communication studies program at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, a J-Schools Canada member, one of the main draws for joining the organization was its links to J-Source, a trade website dedicated to providing news, research, and industry-related information for journalism professionals, scholars and students. J-Schools Canada produces and supports the website, and members will get access to a special section covering journalism education and pedagogy. Ms. Harada said the members-only section is currently in development.

The site is also accepting pitches for paid reporting assignments and republished content from students attending J-Schools Canada member institutions, and members can advertise on J-Source for no extra cost.

J-Schools Canada members currently include Carleton, Kwantlen, Ryerson, Algonquin College, the British Columbia Institute of Technology, the College of the North Atlantic, Lethbridge College, Mount Royal University, the University of British Columbia, the University of King’s College, the University of Ottawa, the University of Regina, the University of Toronto, and Wilfrid Laurier University.

Any postsecondary journalism program can become a member of the association, which will formalize its governing structure at the annual meeting of the Canadian Communication Association in June (held as part of the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, which this year is in Vancouver).",Canadian journalism schools partner in new association,University Affairs,https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/canadian-journalism-schools-partner-in-new-association/

The big night for homegrown music was hosted by cryfest generator/Canadian crooner Sarah McLachlan, who pulled double duty with an empowering performance later on in the night, and celebrated a variety of musical talents and genres, from hip hop and country to rock, pop and Indigenous music.

Let’s break down the good, the bad, and the Canadian of it all, shall we? For the full list of winners, head here.

The Good

Everything Corey Hart

We were all wearing our “Sunglasses at Night” when legendary performer and songwriter Corey Hart was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. A teary-eyed Hart accepted the award and dedicated it to his fans as his wife, Quebec musician Julie Masse, and his four children looked on with tears streaming down their own faces.

“I believe that music and love are the most powerful and enduring forces of good in the world,” he said. “Without music or the Junos, I would have never met my precious Julie. And without love I would have never experienced the miracle of cradling in my arms, my four precious babies… as a songwriter I can honestly say those are the greatest songs I will ever write.”

Cue the waterworks everywhere.

Hart has a long history with the Junos. As McLachlan pointed out, Hart’s “Sunglasses at Night” was the first video to ever win a Juno, but more importantly it was during the broadcast one year that he met Masse, as they presented together. They’ve been going strong ever since. #RelationshipGoals.

In 1993, Corey Hart was supposed to give out #JUNOs for video of the year.

He thought it was wrong for a musician to hand out a visual prize, and balked.

They offered to pair up with Julie Masse to give group of the year. He said yes.

They met that night.

London Calling

How a show opens is always a pretty important indication of how the evening is going to go and the Junos went for hometown hearts with a performance of “Body” by locals-gone-big Loud Luxury. They were joined by the Western Marching Band and the Western Mustang Cheerleaders, who wore their purple loud and proud.

It was an intricate number that undoubtedly sparked a few “They said London!” drinking games on couches across Canada, but it was sweet to see the hosting city get so much recognition. The swelled crowd certainly loved it, and exploded every time another artist coyly nodded, “Hey London,” from the stage.

What a feeling after that AMAZING opening to the #JUNOS. 💜💜💜@LoudLuxury pic.twitter.com/qu9VwoT6rF — The JUNO Awards (@TheJUNOAwards) March 18, 2019

Bülow lights up the stage

Sometimes it’s the simplest performances that resonate the most, as 20-year-old Bülow proved with a stripped down version of “This Is Not a Love Song.” The German-Canadian graced the stage with minimalist makeup and bare feet, using an array of lightbulbs as props while she belted out the hit.

It was only fitting when she won Breakthrough Artist of the Year a commercial break later, and tearfully accepted. We have a feeling she earned a few more social media followers as a result.

Jessie Reyez

After winning last year’s Breakthrough Artist of the Year, it was heartwarming to see the outspoken Reyez take home a statue for RB/Soul Recording of the Year 12 months later. Her speech was the cutest too, as she thanked fans over, and over, and over again.

“If there’s one thing that I leave tonight man, it’s that I am you and you are me,” she said. “If there’s one thing that you’re chasing and you’re willing to work hard for it, do it. Because you can do whatever you want man. Thank y’all so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you…”

And to have that award presented by Sting and super-producer David Foster? Not too shabby.

The Bad

Sarah McLachlan makes it political

The Junos have a long history of sometimes random but mostly musical hosts, like William Shatner, Michael Bublé, Brent Butt and Shania Twain taking on MC duties over the years. This year was Sarah McLachlan’s time to shine, 25 years into her career. And she did shine… for the most part.

As with any awards show, sometimes political speeches land and sometimes they don’t. Rather than address any of the current Canadian political turmoil making headlines or leaning into the music side, McLachlan opted to tackle Trump in her opener and viewers seemed a little thrown.

“You know when you live someplace peaceful and beautiful, and then get a crazy neighbour,” she said. “And they start causing all sorts of trouble like putting up weird walls, picking fights with all the other neighbours, telling your daughters how they should behave, all the while saying they’re making the area great again and you just watch feeling helpless… and hoping they’ll be gone by 2020.”

The remarks weren’t met with (much) anger, per se. Most people just seemed genuinely confused.

Paging Shawn Mendes

Sunday night was unquestionably Shawn Mendes’ time to shine. By the end of the broadcast he walked away with five wins out of his six nominations, including Single (for “In My Blood”), Pop Album and Artist. The only problem? He wasn’t there.

The global popstar is currently on tour and so he wasn’t able to accept any of the accolades in person. Or by proxy. Or by video. It left the show feeling a little hollow and lacklustre, especially when the producers tried to make up for his absence with a “special performance” of “In My Blood” from Amsterdam, which was taped on March 4.

Maybe a heartfelt, taped acceptance speech would have played better, but at least he showed up in some form since he was the night’s big winner.

The fan favourite

Speaking of not showing up, the last award of the night is the we all wait for, and at the Junos, it was the only one voted on by the people who buy the music and the tickets and the merch: the Fan Choice Award. Given Mendes’ online support (hello #MendesArmy) and his big wins it seemed likely that he would sweep the bonus category too, but in the end Avril Lavigne fans showed up and led her to a win. But of course Lavigne wasn’t there either, so instead the night’s big moment just ended with a bit of a whimper.

At least Corey Hart’s show-ending performance was there to save the day.

THE CANADIAN

Indigenous rights

The night was full of tributes and performances, including Jeremy Dutcher’s performance of “Sakomawit” (he won best Indigenous music album during the pre-telecast and was asked to return to the stage by fellow winners Arkells after his thank-you speech was cut off), Elisapie’s ode to women delivered in Inuktitut, and indigenous journalist and author Tanya Telaga reminding everyone of the importance of language in a powerful speech.

Really cool to see Tanya Talaga on the Junos. Seven Fallen Feathers is required reading. And introducing Jeremy Dutcher, who is awesome. — Blake Murphy (@BlakeMurphyODC) March 18, 2019

A mashup of personalities

Sometimes Canadian artists and performers stop by just because they can. That’s how it felt when Rick Mercer, Tessa Virtue, Sting, and the OG grandfather of Canadian hip hop (and former Mr. D star) Maestro Fresh took to the stage at various intervals to present.

Bill C-76, which received royal assent in December, bans the use of money from foreign entities to conduct partisan campaigns. It also requires online platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to create a registry of all digital advertisements placed by political parties or third parties during the pre-writ and writ periods and to ensure they remain visible to the public for two years.

It actually regulates online platforms, including Facebook,” Chan said. “In order to comply we actually need to build new systems and new products to be able to do this, so right now we have our product-engineering teams working very, very hard between now and the end of June to ensure that we will be in compliance with what C-76 requires.” Advertisements that refer to political figures, political parties, elections, legislation or issues of national importance will have to go through an authorization process. This will capture the information of the entity or group buying the ad and ensure the buyer is based in Canada. Political ads that appear on Facebook during the pre-writ and writ periods will be labelled with a “paid for by” disclosure. People will be able to click the disclosure and see the ad library. This library will include information on the ad’s reach — who saw it, their gender and location, as well as a range of its impressions. Information in the library will be viewable and searchable online for up to seven years, which exceeds the period required in the new election laws.

Another effort to exceed the legislative rules will see Facebook using its artificial-intelligence technologies and algorithms to detect ads or content that tries to circumvent the rules. “We recognize that there’s going to probably be the potential for bad actors to try to work around the system — in other words, they may want to run a political ad and not seek to self-declare and not seek to be authorized,” Chan said. “That is obviously problematic for us because we recognize that the spirit of what Parliament intended and what we intend, in terms of what we’re trying to do, is provide the most transparency for political ads as possible.”

To help Facebook predict what issues might become key points of debate in the federal election, the company has amassed an group of policy advisers from a wide range of political backgrounds and expertise. The group includes: former NDP MP Megan Leslie; former Stephen Harper aide Ray Novak, who is the managing director of Harper and Associates; Antonia Maioni, McGill University’s dean of arts; Ry Moran, executive director of the truth and reconciliation centre at the University of Manitoba; and David Zussman, a professor at the University of Victoria’s school of public administration.

By Brian Mulroney

A challenge to visionary leadership in Canada and elsewhere is anti-Semitism.

Anti-Semitism is born in ignorance and nurtured in envy. It is the stepchild of delusion and evil.

The ongoing success of Canada’s Jewish community is consequently often misunderstood, misrepresented and misreported. The rise in the number of attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions in Canada testifies to the intractability of the problem and the constant need for vigilance, consistency and strength in dealing with the entire sweep of anti-Semitism.

The rise in the number of attacks … testifies to the intractability of the problem

In Dante’s Inferno it is noted that “the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who in times of great moral crisis, strive to maintain their neutrality.” In fact, ambivalence on an issue of such importance is for the cowardly, which is why each of us must stand up and be counted, and why our elected leaders cannot duck or dodge.

Anti-Semitic incidents are on the rise everywhere including in this country, where B’nai B’rith reported a 26-per-cent increase in events — such as harassment, vandalism and violence — to 1,752, a record high; to the U.K., where the clueless leader of the Official Opposition directs a motley and pathetic crew that includes open anti-Semites and proud opponents of Israel; to the Continent, where Jeffrey Goldberg reported in The Atlantic that in a recent year 51 per cent of all racist attacks in France targeted Jews although Jews account for only one per cent of France’s population; to the U.S. Congress, where a Democratic representative aroused enormous concerns when she publicly decried “dual loyalties” involving American Jews and Israel.

So new steps must be taken. Among them, the federal government should consider the appointment of a blue-ribbon panel composed of Canada’s most distinguished citizens.

They could examine the growth of Holocaust denial, introduce action in co-operation with the provinces and territories of obligatory education about the Holocaust and the courageous history of Jewish survival, and urge the consideration and implementation of a national action plan to combat anti-Semitism, as Norway and France have done.

Only if Canada reaches out to our youth to obliterate anti-Semitism … will real progress be made in a manner that will honour our citizenship in this splendid country of which we are all so proud.

Only if Canada reaches out to our youth to obliterate anti-Semitism … will real progress be made

After all, according to the Azrieli Foundation, 22 per cent of young Canadian adults haven’t heard about, or weren’t sure they had heard about, the Holocaust. In addition, 49 per cent of young adults in the same survey couldn’t name a concentration camp.

I took an extremely strong stand while prime minister against anti-Semitism in all of its forms. I stood proudly with the Jewish community and with those determined to provide unshakeable support for the state of Israel. Let us always maintain that noble tradition.

Leaders must have vision and they must find the courage to fight for the policies that will give that vision life. Leaders must govern not for easy headlines in 10 days but for a better Canada in 10 years — and they must be ready to endure the attacks that often accompany profound or controversial change, while they await the distant and compelling sounds of a verdict that only history and a more reflective nation can render in the fullness of time. …

Leaders must govern not for easy headlines in 10 days but for a better Canada in 10 years

From the bloodied sands of Afghanistan to the pristine snows and surging waters of the high Arctic — and everything in between — the Canada of 50 years from now will be defined by the leadership we are given today.

The 56-year-old author and professor of psychology, who has styled himself as an opponent of so-called political correctness, had been due to take up the fellowship later this year to do research on religion.

On Wednesday, the university confirmed the fellowship from the department of divinity had been withdrawn. It declined to say when the decision had been taken or why.

Mr Peterson said he had not officially informed of the university’s move, or its reasoning.

Yet, he told The Independent he believed it was because he did not appeal to the “diversity, equity and inclusivity mob” at the institution – “the political correctness types”.

Mr Peterson, whose books include Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief and 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, informed his nearly two million subscribers on YouTube on Monday evening that, having recently returned from a tour of Australia and New Zealand, he would be taking up a fellowship at Cambridge in the autumn.

“In October I am going to Cambridge University in the UK for two months and I will be a visiting fellow there at the divinity school and should give me the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months, as well as students,” he said.

On Wednesday, the department of divinity tweeted that the fellowship had been withdrawn. The university declined to explain the decision. A spokesperson said in a statement: “We can confirm that Jordan Peterson requested a visiting fellowship, and an initial offer has been rescinded after a further review.”

Cambridge University Students Union said it was pleased by the decision, telling Varsity: “His work and views are not representative of the student body and as such we do not see his visit as a valuable contribution to the university, but one that works in opposition to the principles of the university.”

Mr Peterson, who last year had a controversial interview with Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman wherein Newman challenged him over some of views on women, including referring to some as “crazy, harpy sisters”, said the university had lost out on a chance for him present a series of lectures on the Biblical book of Genesis.

He said he suspected the department of divinity was attempting to capitalise on its “virtue signalling”.

“It’s not going to stop me. I will do them in Canada or somewhere,” he said. “It’s not that I am going to be unable to occupy myself in October and November.”

He said he believed the students' union was among those who had been protesting the fellowship, hence its “gleeful reaction” to the decision.

Asked if the problem was not his association with culture war topics such as masculinity and gender pay gaps, rather than his standing as an authority on religion, he said: “I’m better known for that only if you read newspaper article headlines, not by people who actually follow what I have done.”

Asked about the students who had opposed the fellowship, he said: “They don’t know anything about me.”

Among faculty and alumni, the decision to withdraw the fellowship received a mixed reaction. Conservative writer Toby Young tweeted: “Cambridge University Students' Union says “his work and views are not representative of the student body”. Isn’t that the point, you numbskulls?”

Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches in the university’s English department, responded with sarcasm.

“The truth is Cambridge just doesn’t have enough sage authoritative white men who believe they know better than everyone else and can tell the world how to run itself,” she said. “We need to ship them in from outside.”

Canadian Legal Professionals’ Information Activities: What Do They Do, and How Do They Tweet?

ABSTRACT

The use of social media in professional settings has increased significantly over the past decade. This article presents the results of a statistical analysis performed on a sampling of Canadian legal professionals’ Twitter accounts between 2015 and 2016. A series of tweets were reviewed and subsequently categorized to determine the most common types of information activities occurring on social media accounts, specifically Twitter, from legal professionals.

INTRODUCTION

The use of social media and social networking platforms in a variety of professions, including the legal profession, has significantly increased over the past decade. In 2008, research performed by LexisNexis and Martindale, two of the leading providers of legal content and management resources, showed that more than 50 per cent of US attorneys actively used social media and social networking professionally. Similar research by the International Bar Association (IBA) in 2012 that received responses from 60 bar associations worldwide showed that 78 per cent of participants believed that the use of social media and social networking tools were advantageous for the legal profession.

One social media platform that legal professionals often use is Twitter. Twitter’s self-defined purpose is to

contain information you will find valuable. Messages from users you choose to follow will show up on your home page for you to read. It’s like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you’ll always find interesting—you can discover news as it’s happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time.

The microblogging aspect of Twitter is useful for professionals as it creates posts that are concise, focussed, and clearly depict the intention of the profile owner. Legal research requires precision with highly relevant, quality results while the business of law requires advertising and marketing. Twitter fulfils both these requirements, as it is both a real-time, convenient, and accessible database for current awareness as well as a public platform for self-promotion for legal professionals.

Research that provides a better understanding of legal professionals’ information activities will help to clarify best practices and research methods for legal professionals in an increasingly digital work environment. These findings will also elaborate on the information activities of legal professionals by clarifying their position within existing information behaviour models and providing additional information for the creation of information models directed towards lawyers specifically and, potentially, professionals as a group.

…

Objectives

The purpose of this research is to determine and categorize the information activities of Canadian legal professionals on Twitter. The objectives for determining and categorizing their information activities will include:

Do providers make posts to refer and/or to provide links to current awareness or self-promotion?

a. Does one of these categories occur more frequently? Are there other categories of information?

a. If so, which occurs most frequently? Does one of these categories, including the undefined categories, receive more engagement in the form of retweets and/or likes?

Clarification of the way that legal professionals interact with information through their activity on Twitter should assist in determining their real-time information needs.

Hypothesis

Current awareness and self-promotion will be the two most common information activities legal professionals perform online. Legal professionals will post current awareness materials more frequently than materials for self-promotion. Additional categories of information activities will exist, but they will be less prevalent than current awareness and self-promotion. One category of an information activity will have a higher rate of retweets and likes.

Definitions

Self-promotion: Content that provides announcements on personal involvement in presentations, publications, probono work, receiving awards, etc., related to the legal profession. Self-promotion is a method of enhancing professional image in a positive way to their colleagues, clients, and general public.

Current awareness: Content that is relevant to the legal profession, including case law, recent decisions at all levels of court, periodicals and other legal publications, legislation and additional government resources, news, conference proceedings, blogs, etc.

Alternative categories: Content that could not be described under the previously listed definitions of current awareness or self-promotion.

Methodology

To better understand how legal professionals are using Twitter to interact with information relevant to their work, a snowball sampling of Canadian legal professionals’ Twitter accounts was used. Snowball sampling uses a predefined list of users identified as experts by a medium outside of Twitter. This technique is useful when focussing on national-level or topical-based user groups. The predefined lists were drawn from Canadian Lawyer Magazine and a Twitter list created by a leading Canadian privacy and technology lawyer. Only open Twitter profiles were considered due to the nature of the data extraction tool and the assumption that the nature of the definitions aligned with account owners who were trying to reach a large audience and would, therefore, not maintain a private account.

A total of 67 accounts were compiled in the initial list. This list was reduced to the 25 accounts with the highest number of followers. This decrease is based on the assumption that followers are an indication of authority, validity of content, and consistent engagement. The most recent 50 tweets from each of these 25 accounts (1,250 tweets) were extracted from Twitter into 25 individual .txt .csv compatible files via Professor Michael Smit of the School of Information Management, Dalhousie University, through the use of a command line tool called GET statuses/user_timeline. These sheets were edited to contain only the most recent 50 tweets with information relating to the date the tweet was published, number of likes the tweet received, number of retweets the tweet received, and the text of the tweet for categorical analysis. Retweets were not included in the 50 tweets unless they had content added by the account owner to supplement or alter the original tweet. Each file was examined individually, and data was transferred to a master list after the text of each tweet had undergone categorical analysis.

These tweets were categorized under the previously defined information activities of:

Current awareness

Self-promotion

Alternative

The alternative content group was subsequently analyzed to determine if other categories of information activities were identifiable through reoccurring content themes. Once the tweets were categorized, a quantitative analysis determined which category was the most frequently posted by legal professionals.

The retweets and likes were sorted to determine the category that contained the largest number. The number of total retweets and likes per category were totalled to retrieve the sum of each. The number of tweets in each category was used to determine how many tweets received a retweet or a like. This total number was divided by the number of tweets within each separate category to return the percentage of retweets and likes for all categories.

The accounts were limited to individual legal professionals and excluded institutional accounts, such as law libraries, courthouses, or law firms. This exclusion was due to lack of identification regarding who is posting content and obligations to represent institutional opinions or neutrality. Simply put, legal institutions were assumed to have different information activities on Twitter than individual legal professionals. As the primary goal was to analyze the provision of information and its intended use, conversation tweets (replies) and retweets were also excluded.

Limitations

This study excludes legal institutions that host Twitter accounts due to the variations in information activities they are engaged with on Twitter and the inability to identify whether they have a singular or multitude of owners/contributors. Due to the volume of tweets available and the time frame associated with this study, this analysis was performed on a small scale and is not completely representative of the population of legal professionals in Canada. The selection of the top 50 tweets occurred on March 5, 2016. Twitter is frequently updated, and this analysis may be affected by trending events that occurred within the relative time frame prior to or on this date. Although social media and networking platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are used, Twitter is the sole focus of this study due to the availability of open data. This study does not focus on passive or intentional searching for the retrieval of information from Twitter. It focusses on the provision of information and its intended use for others.

Results

Sample Population

The 1,250 tweets were drawn on March 5, 2016. The tweets were sent between October 16, 2015 and March 5, 2016. The majority of tweets (86 per cent) were posted within a 12-day period between February 23, 2016 and March 5, 2016. This indicates that the account owners were actively engaging in communication via Twitter. The population of the final 25 accounts consisted of 24 per cent women and 76 per cent men. A 2014 publication from the Law Society of Upper Canada found that, although more women are called to the bar and enter the legal profession by an average of 4 per cent more than men, they often experience a change of status within the first 5 to 10 years of their careers. A change in status indicates that they have opted to take leaves or pursued alternate career paths outside of a legal organization. As a result, the gender ratios are approximately 45 per cent women to

55 per cent men at the associate and general employee level and 21 per cent women to 79 per cent men at the partner level.31 Although these statistics rely heavily on legal professionals who practice law, the majority (63 per cent) of the final sample used for this research were practicing lawyers. This suggests that the sample was an appropriate representation of the current legal field.

The accounts ranged from 1,520–85,800 followers due to the varying prominence of the legal professionals within the field. The breakdown of types of legal professionals is displayed in figure 1. The total number of types of legal professionals was seven, with several account owners holding multiple positions related to the legal profession (e.g., practicing lawyer and professor). The legal professionals identified as practicing lawyers practiced in eight different areas of law, as displayed in figure 2. These areas include business, family, Indigenous, international, labour, personal injury, privacy, and technology. The accounts acquired through the Twitter list created by the leading privacy and technology lawyer may have created a denser population within the areas of technology and privacy, as they practice in these areas of law and likely follow accounts that display content relevant to their area of practice. Eighty per cent of the account owners maintained their own individual websites or contributed to shared websites as authors, editors, and web developers. The remaining 20 per cent were visible on their employers’ organizational or institutional websites but did not generate their own content. Geographically the lawyers were located across Canada, in Ontario (64 per cent), British Columbia (20 per cent), Nova Scotia (4 per cent), Newfoundland (4 per cent), Quebec (4 per cent), and Nunavut (4 per cent) to cover five provinces and one territory.

Categorical Analysis

During the analysis of the tweets, it was discovered that several accounts had duplicate tweets that contained identical content. It was assumed that these duplicates were not intentional, and these tweets were discounted from the analysis to eliminate bias within one category. The total number of tweets analyzed was reduced from 1,250 to 1,243.

The content analysis was done by matching the contents with the previously defined categories: self-promotion, current awareness, and alternative. To accurately categorize the content, all tweets containing links to additional content were opened in separate browser windows and the added content was examined to determine the appropriate categorization. This examination included observing the overall text content, the author, publisher, editor, developer, and organization with which it was associated. It was assumed followers would have information on any blogs or periodical publications that the account owner would post updates on; therefore, if contextual information was not provided in a post (e.g., new post up on John Smith’s Law Blog: newpost.johnslawblog. com), it was still considered self-promotion and not current awareness.

Hypothesis 1 & 2

Current awareness was the most frequently practiced information activity by Canadian legal professionals with 577 (46 per cent) of 1,243 tweets being categorized under this definition. Self-promotion accounted for 291 (23 per cent) of 1,243 tweets and was the second most frequent information activity. Hypothesis 1 and 2 are supported by these findings.

Hypothesis 3

Once the alternative categories column had been populated, it was analyzed to determine consistent themes. Hypothesis 3 was supported by the inclusion of the following definitions of additional categories of Canadian legal professionals’ information activities:

General Communication with Other Legal Professional(s): Content as communication directed at specific individuals that were also identified as legal professionals or to legal institutions, organizations, publications, etc.

Personal Opinion on a Legal Topic: Content focussing on a specific topic pertinent to legal professionals with an explicitly expressed opinion from the account owner without a link to an alternative document or resource on the topic.

Personal Political Opinion: Content focussing on a political topic with an explicitly expressed opinion from the account owner that indicated a bias toward or against a specific politician or party.

Job Posting: Content related to a current opportunity within the legal profession directed at the entirety of their followers.

Unrelated to Legal Profession: Content that did not relate to the legal profession.

The category that occurred most frequently was unrelated to legal profession with 208 (17 per cent) of 1,243 tweets. Two categories occurred at the same frequency: personal political opinion, which included 74 (6 per cent) of 1,243 tweets, and general communication with legal professional(s), which accounted for 71 (6 per cent) of 1,243 tweets. The remaining additional categories, personal opinion on a legal topic and job posting within the legal profession, occurred 18 (1.5 per cent) of 1,243 and 4 (0.5 per cent) of 1,243 tweets, respectively. These findings also support Hypothesis 3, as the additional category unrelated to legal profession occurred 6 per cent less than the next most frequent predetermined category of self-promotion.

Hypothesis 4

The category with the highest number of retweets was personal political opinion with 64 per cent of tweets within this category receiving engagement through retweets. The category with the highest number of likes was general communication with other legal professional(s), with 79 per cent of tweets within this category receiving engagement through likes. Hypothesis 4 was not supported by these findings, as the rate of retweets and likes was not confined to one category. The remaining retweet and like rates per category are displayed in figure 3.

Discussion

Both the predetermined categories and the additional categories suggest that the primary information activity of lawyers is providing, or sharing, information. This type of information activity is supported by the definition of Twitter as a real-time newsfeed designed to suit individuals’ interests. It is the platform that best suits their needs for the provision of information.

Although not included as a hypothesis, during data analysis it became apparent that determining the frequency of participation by each individual account owner within the sample population would be an important factor in establishing the popularity and success of each category. Figures 4 and 5 display the participation rates for each category. These findings correspond to the number of tweets as stated in the results section and support the previous findings.

The predetermined categories of current awareness and self-promotion were the most common types of tweets. These categories can be identified as significant information activities that legal professionals engage in regardless of environment. A new information behaviour model specific to legal professionals could be designed including, or based on, these categories and sharing information activities. It also supports Leckie, Pettigrew, and Sylvain’s research that links roles and tasks to specific information activities. The provision of current awareness information and the action of self-promotion information are two separate tasks that are related to specific roles. For instance, drafting is a role that requires current awareness research as a task. Leckie’s five roles could be categorized under each of these associated tasks to provide a clarification of the type of task associated with each role.

Current awareness was identified as the most common information activity that legal professionals perform online and accounted for almost half of all tweets that were analyzed. These results, combined with the definition of Twitter as a news source, correlate with Mote’s research that indicated that professionals with a wide scope possess the highest information needs. Legal professionals are engaging in highly consistent information activities through the provision of current awareness via tweets. Twitter’s platform for providing information could be used as a technical model to improve electronic legal databases and develop recommended systems for legal resources. The high frequency of current awareness also provides information on the real-time research needs of legal professionals that could be used to improve institutional intranets to display relevant material to the appropriate demographic (e.g., based on type of profession, area of law, geography, etc.) as resources are updated internally.

The frequency of current awareness tweets in the study supports the notion that legal professionals require finding tools for frequently updated databases. Twitter simultaneously acts as a database that is frequently updated by leaders in the area of law while being a repository of these resources organized by individuals’ personal interests. It thus provides a model of a platform through which best practices can be developed and subsequently implemented within alternative databases that possess the legal rights of distribution of large legal publishers of resources like case law or statutes.

The highest rate of likes occurred within the additional category of general communication with other legal professionals. This category provided a link to an external resource the least often. These tweets did contain some discussion with other legal professionals about resources but were primarily congratulatory in nature. When a colleague engaged in an activity that contributed to their professional development (e.g., publishing a book, speaking at a conference, accepting an award or promotion, etc.), the 64 per cent of the sample population that participated in general communication with other legal professionals was likely to tweet a congratulations or compliment and receive likes on this tweet. These findings may indicate that mutual respect and appreciation among colleagues is an effective method of networking and self-promoting via Twitter.

An unexpected theme that appeared in the alternative category were tweets related to the ongoing American presidential electoral process and the most recent Canadian federal election. Although politics certainly have the potential to affect the law, political tweets concerning the ongoing American election or the most recent Canadian election that contained opinionated commentary from the account owner were categorized within alternative and subsequently defined as personal political opinions. If the tweet shared a political update without opinion, it was classified as current awareness. This was to differentiate between tweets with bias and without, as the definition of current awareness does not indicate that a personal bias is present in the dispersion of recent information.

Generally, it is recommended that professional accounts remain silent on personal opinions on polarizing topics such as politics. However, the geographic and political separation of Canada and the United States combined with the dramatic nature of the US election at this time in 2016 may create a setting where Canadians respond positively to these results. This may be indicated by the high rate of retweets that occurred within the additional category of personal political opinion.

…

Conclusion

This analysis of legal professionals’ information sharing activities on Twitter indicates that the information needs of Canadian legal professionals are largely related to current awareness to support up-to-date legal decision making and self-promotion to increase their presence and reputation within the legal community. These information activities were supplemented by five additional categories of information activities that support information sharing as a significant information activity in which Canadian legal professionals engage. Further research into the definition of self-promotion may assist in understanding the intention and effectiveness of providing self-promotional information. Assessing the opposite information activity of acquiring information via Twitter by Canadian legal professionals would provide an interesting comparative analysis as well.

Additionally, the data describing the rate of retweets and likes suggests that best practices on professional Twitter accounts could be improved through the provision of more current awareness and self-promotion in the form of congeniality amongst colleagues. Databases, intranets, and their related finding tools could be improved based on the information provided through the rate of retweets and likes on specific current awareness topics and an examination of the demographics of an account owner.

The company had very ...,"Nearly everyone now knows the story of how Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, has alleged that she was unduly pressured by Trudeau and other senior officials to offer a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

The Green Party hasn ...","It’s beginning to look a lot like electoral season. Everywhere you go, political parties are vying for your vote, even going as far as to text Albertans directly. With all too early political messaging and unsolicited texts abound, it makes you wonder why political parties even continue a practice like this.



As many of us know, Mary, the texting robot of the United Conservative Party, wants to know if she can count on you in the coming election. No matter that the election has just been called, the Conservatives have your phone number and now they — or rather Mary — wants your vote. The NDP has their own texter on front lines named Mike, who has been equally as annoying as Mary. The only difference is that Mike seems to be a human, which somehow is even more irritating. At least Mary is just following orders; I expected better from you, Mike.



But hold on, isn’t there some law that prevents Mary and Mike from sending me unsolicited text messages? Well, there is: it’s called Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL). But according to the government of Canada, “commercial electronic messages (CEMs) sent by or on behalf of a political party… are excluded from… CASL, if the primary purpose of the CEM is to solicit a contribution.” The reason for this is that it’s apparently in the public interest to receive these texts. Interest of the party maybe, and even that’s debatable.

It’s appalling that political parties would even consider these tactics. Given that they’re politicians, we can only assume they’re human, and if that’s the case, they should know that when people receive calls or texts from any kind of telemarketer, they will eventually be compelled to automatically reject the telemarketer’s message. It seems these parties were so preoccupied with whether or not they could send these messages that they didn’t stop to think if they should.



Perhaps they think that if a Canadian citizen doesn’t hear from them for a little while, they’ll just assume the party has disbanded. I mean, it could happen. The Green Party hasn’t ever really done that well in Alberta, so maybe they could pack it in someday. But who’s gonna assume the UCP have finally given up the fight? Is anyone actually gonna look down at their phone and say, “Damn, Mary, I forgot we had a conservative party, thanks for the heads up.”



But this is a democracy. Surely if voters really didn’t want to hear from politicians through texts and cold-calls, they’d put their vote elsewhere. The problem is that as we get deeper into the electoral season, these unsolicited messages will likely become a staple of every big party out there. Where can a voter go when all around are parties lowering themselves to the most annoying tactics in order to gain the upper hand? Seemingly the only way to escape this immense political spam is to move to the territories, where the cell reception is made up and Albertan political parties can’t reach you.



Someone needs to let these politicians know they’re only hurting their reputation in continuing with the spam. People have a bad enough view of the government anyways. Things like the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and a little less recently, the Alison Redford expenditure scandal, only work to widen the gap between representative and constituent. Having Mary slide into my DMs is not gonna help your case.

And while those problems are also evident in Delhi Crime, Mehta ...","× Expand Samuel Engelking Richie Mehta Canadian director Richie Mehta takes a harrowing look at the 2012 Delhi gang rape case in the Netflix series Delhi Crime.

DELHI CRIME (Richie Mehta). Seven episodes streaming on Netflix on Friday (March 22).

Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta always imagined a career making sci-fi movies, never intending to forge a path that keeps returning to his Indian roots.

His 2007 debut feature, Amal, about a rickshaw driver in New Delhi, was meant to be a one-off calling card. Then he happened across a chain-wallah who inspired 2013’s Siddharth. And then came Ridley Scott, who tapped Mehta to turn crowd-sourced videos from YouTube into the 2016 documentary India In A Day. Despite being raised in the GTA, Mehta has distinguished himself among the few filmmakers rigorously and empathically tackling heavy social issues in India.

Now that platforms like Netflix are disrupting the screen industries in Hollywood and Bollywood and allowing new voices to be heard, more content coming from India is exploring the kind of harrowing subject matter that has never made Mehta flinch. Meanwhile, his work is about to reach his widest audience yet.

Delhi Crime, his seven-part procedural dropping on Netflix, painstakingly details the investigation and social fallout from 2012’s Delhi gang rape in which 23-year-old Jyoti Singh was beaten, raped and tortured with an iron rod by six men on a private bus. She died from her injuries two weeks after the assault. The crime grabbed international headlines, led to protests, riots and some vigilante fervour in a community trying to get a handle on the immense shock and horror and what they should do about it.

The series follows the police investigation spearheaded by the deputy commissioner of police Vartika Chaturvedi (Shefali Shah), who coordinated the hunt for the perpetrators. We don’t see the crime committed, but follow its immediate aftermath. Mehta focuses on the forensics, but as with his previous Delhi-set films, he’s eyeing the periphery.

The show takes place over two weeks in Delhi, observing a patriarchal society where women are routinely victimized, and a widening gap between classes fuels further hatred.

For a Canadian director now residing in the UK, the social structures that feed into gendered violence in India is topical everywhere. Mehta’s investigation into the subject kept bringing me back to the Toronto van attack, and the incel community that inspired it.

Grappling with evil

Mehta is in New Delhi, speaking to me over video chat in the morning, before getting back to work on Delhi Crime’s second season, which will tackle a different crime and likely be released next year. He took five years to develop the first – the last few months consisted of 16-hour days – and the process looks like it considerably aged him since our the last time I interviewed him.

That was in 2013 when Siddharth, Mehta’s devastating fictional story about an impoverished chain-wallah searching for his missing son, had just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. At that time, Mehta had just begun researching the Jyoti Singh case for Delhi Crime.

The filmmaker was in Delhi when Singh was attacked, completing post-production on Siddharth while following news reports about the Singh case and witnessing the fallout. Some time later, his family friend, a retired police commissioner, encouraged the Canadian director to consider making a film about the incident, offering access to case files and the investigating officers.

“I’m reading about evil,” says Mehta, describing the early stages in his three-and-a-half-year research and writing process. “Diving into it. Dreaming about it. Sleeping with it. Eating with it. I became anti-social in that [early] period. Then you continue on and start to put it together, formatting it in a way that’s palatable.”

He repeatedly met with Singh’s parents, reporting on what he was doing and asking whether they approved. The resulting procedural hangs close to police details and the environment they work in, and makes for an illuminative companion piece to compatriot Deepa Mehta’s 2016 film Anatomy Of Violence, which also took on the Singh rape case.

In that film, Deepa Mehta (unrelated) takes a compassionate but not at all forgiving look at the perpetrators, imagining the conditions in their upbringing and social life that might have led to such a monstrous act.

Anatomy Of Violence’s thesis is similar to that of the investigators interviewed by the Delhi Crime creator. The officers, who Mehta describes as “de facto psychologists after many years on the job,” point to the widening gap between the rich and poor, particularly over the last 15 years.

“You have more money in society literally presenting itself,” he says. “More infrastructure being built, more people are wearing their money, and less people have access to it than before. People at the bottom are physically seeing more money present and they don’t have it, which creates a kind of strife.”

The police also pointed to a boom in uneducated youth, particularly among males, and sudden access to pornography on basic smart phones consumed by many young men.

“You’re seeing women rise up [economically] in society in a manner that you’re not [doing],” Mehta continues. “If you’re taught to treat women a certain way – that they have a certain place in a patriarchal system – and see women rising [up] around you, you’re feeling more and more that you want to objectify them.

“All of these things converge and can create these types of explosions in very frustrated anti-social men. There is a swelling anger that manifests itself in psychotic behaviour.”

The overlap between that explanation and the frustrations and social behaviour attributed to incels in the West, particularly in the case of Toronto van attack culprit Alek Minassian, is not lost on Mehta. Anti-social behaviour, ingrained misogyny and a sense of entitlement are all at work.

Mehta attributes a primary motivation for telling this story to a key statistic. While sex crimes in India are rampant, the U.S. and UK have the most reported rape cases per capita: rape cases per 100,000 people in the U.S. and UK are nearly seven times that of India.

That isn’t meant to minimize the issues in India, and certainly the statistic doesn’t take into consideration how many incidents go unreported. But for the director, that number narrowed the distance between East and West and unravelled the prevailing higher-than-thou attitude some Canadians feel toward Indian society.

In movies like Slumdog Millionaire, Lion and even those made by both Deepa Mehta and Richie Mehta, everything from sex slavery to political corruption in India is on display. And while those problems are also evident in Delhi Crime, Mehta found something inspiring to zero in on: the Indian police officers trying to do good despite the obstacles they face.

Keeping the peace

Mehta’s admiration for the officers involved in the Singh case isn’t an apologia for the rampant corruption within the force, from bribery to human rights abuses. The characters in Delhi Crime work to fight these issues.

In 2016, Human Rights Watch reported 591 deaths in Indian police custody between 2010 to 2015, a regular occurrence stemming from a culture of impunity. Even a perpetrator captured in the Jyoti Singh case died in custody. That was ruled a suicide, though some suspect otherwise.

Mehta likens that police culture Serpico-era 70s New York City, and believes the Indian police system needs an overhaul. India upholds the Imperial Police Service left behind by the British. During the colonial period, the Brits were the officers and they relied on locals to be constables. Constables could never become high-ranking officers. That system remains, with class hierarchies dictating ranks.

“Incentive is the key to non-corrupt policing,” says Mehta, pointing out why a constable with no opportunity to move up in their career would be susceptible to bribery and more.

Mehta also acknowledges that women being afraid to report sexual assaults to police affects the statistics. But he’s also noticed, at least in Delhi, more female police officers at every station. India began introducing more all-female police stations in the early 2000s to push back against gender biases and make victims feel more comfortable. That led to a 22 per cent increase in reports of violence against women.

The compassion of a female police officer is what Mehta hangs his entire series on. Shefali Shah’s Vartika is based on Chhaya Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police who oversaw the Singh investigation. Called “Madame Sir” – because the patriarchy gets confused – Sharma is portrayed as a woman whose gutted, visceral response to the attack motivates her to go above and beyond and take total control of the investigation.

“It was her reaction to the crime that led to it being solved,” says Mehta.

When he met Sharma for coffee, the woman behind the counter at the café repeatedly refused to take the deputy commissioner’s money.

“She had this look of ‘My superhero just walked in,’” he says. “Imagine this happening in Toronto. Somebody is in awe of a cop!”

A new Indian mainstream

The conversation I’m having with Mehta today is a great deal more optimistic than the one we had in 2013, particularly when discussing Indian cinema as a whole.

At that time, it seemed like Deepa Mehta and Richie Mehta were the only prominent filmmakers grappling with India’s social issues. Meanwhile, Bollywood spoon-fed audiences glamour and fantasy.

“[Bollywood filmmakers] could be more mindful of the power of what they are able to do,” Mehta had said at the time. “But they aren’t, by and large.”

But then along came stellar work like The Lunchbox, Court and, more recently, Village Rockstars. Those are indie films, but Mehta points out that such distinctions are breaking down, as even more Bollywood films like Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury’s Pink and Shree Narayan Singh’s Toilet tackle gender and social issues.

“Things have changed so much,” says Mehta. And at the risk of sounding like he’s stumping for his benefactor, he credits platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for aiding that progress, giving new voices opportunities to make compelling projects, and giving audiences access to discover them.

Amal and Siddharth were not released in India until they hit Netflix. Soon after Delhi Crime drops, expect Deepa Mehta’s new series, Leila, on the platform as well.

“Filmmakers, artists and creators are enabled to finally do the thing they’ve been fighting so hard to do. It’s edgier work, more probing. And there’s more grey zone.”

The carbon tax: The carbon tax might become the biggest political football during the upcoming campaign period.,"Alberta has officially entered into the election campaign, one expected to be highly divisive before people head to the polls later this spring.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley on March 19 called the election for April 16, prompting candidates of all political stripes to begin their official campaigns.

The battle for power so far is primarily between the United Conservative Party and the governing NDP, with leaders of each party offering differing visions for the province.

The UCP is currently leading the race, according to some opinion polls, but the party could lose traction as the RCMP investigate former leadership candidate Jeff Callaway’s campaign for irregular political contributions during the 2017 leadership race.

For agriculture, the issues that will likely dominate the headlines include Alberta’s crude-by-rail plan, farm safety, the carbon tax, research funding, abandoned oil and gas wells and rural school funding.

The Western Producer will be on the campaign trail, reporting regularly on issues that affect all producers.

Crude by rail: There are concerns grain shipments will stall once Alberta begins shipping more oil by rail.

The province is spending $3.7 billion to move 120,000 barrels per day by mid 2020, with smaller shipments to begin this summer.

Premier Rachel Notley argues the rail cars are needed to get more Alberta oil to market, given pipeline delays have stalled industry from expanding. She has said grain will get top priority.

Producer groups, however, worry more oil by rail will create logjams, delaying grain shipments to export markets.

Effects of the plan won’t be known until they are in place, but transportation experts think grain should remain unscathed.

ADVERTISEMENT

UCP leader Jason Kenney has said he would cancel the plan’s contract with Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway, arguing the province could make better use of the money.

Farm safety: Alberta’s newly enforced farm safety legislation will get scrapped if the UCP forms government this spring.

The legislation, which was consulted on at length, has been contentious with farmers, requiring people with non-family employees to have mandatory WCB coverage and follow a set of regulations.

The UCP is proposing to kill the legislation and then re-write its own version by this fall after consulting with producers, likely granting exemptions to small farmers.

The NDP likes to point out the rules don’t apply to family members or neighbours, calling the UCP’s move atrocious because it says it would strip worker protection.

The Ag Coalition, which makes up multiple producer groups, has said it supports the legislation, but there are likely other farmers that’s don’t approve of it.

The carbon tax: The carbon tax might become the biggest political football during the upcoming campaign period.

ADVERTISEMENT

The UCP plans to scrap the tax, which applies to home heating and at the gas pump.

Farmers are exempt from paying the tax on marked fuel and diesel but largely disapprove of it because it affects their bottom line in other areas.

The NDP, however, has argued the tax has reduced emissions and spurred economic development in green technologies, offering people renewable electricity alternatives that, if adopted, lower costs in the long run.

The tax has funnelled millions of dollars to rural Alberta, whether for upgrading farm equipment and buildings or for electricity projects in local community buildings.

Research funding: Agriculture research recently entered the political arena with concerns it’s becoming less farmer-led.

The UCP has charged the NDP has slowed funding to some research organizations, taking more control over dollars.

The NDP has said producers are still heavily involved in research. The government is now focusing on public good research, according to Agriculture Minister Oneil Carlier, rather than funding large profitable corporations.

Abandoned oil and gas wells: There are a growing number of abandoned oil and gas wells on farmland, leaving farmers un-compensated and largely with the clean-up bill.

More to the problem is some operational oil and gas companies have chosen not to pay municipal taxes, putting communities in a difficult position to fund critical services.

The NDP has introduced a number of measures to help with the problem and is expected to unveil more plans to crack down on bad industry players.

In government, the NDP has so far given the Alberta Energy Regulator the authority to tag bad operators, allowing them to not re-authorize drilling licenses if they re-enter industry.

The UCP hasn’t yet announced plans to address this problem head-on, but has said it would review property rights legislation if elected.

The recent Redwater Supreme Court ruling has also changed the game, ensuring bankrupt companies fulfill their environmental clean-up duties before their assets go to bank creditors.

Rural school funding: Rural school advocates are hoping the next government will re-vamp the current funding model, ensuring education in small communities remains viable.

The NDP has said it would look at the model if elected for another term.

The UCP, however, has indicated it would freeze education funding, meaning growing schools wouldn’t get more cash.

Advocates say freezing education might have marginal, if any effects, on rural schools.

I know many of our local farmers are concerned about the decision by the Chinese government to cancel the canola import permit for Richardson International, one of Canada’s largest grain processors. I share these concerns and have discussed what impact this could have on our region’s agriculture producers with Pouce Coupe’s town council.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry is citing fears of insect infestation as the reason for canceling their canola import permit, however the Chinese government has yet to provide any evidence to support these claims.

We all know that our farmers produce the highest quality canola in the world and that these baseless allegations have nothing to do with Canada’s canola product. Instead, this calls into question the Liberal government’s ongoing failure to handle Canada’s relationship with China.

I am deeply concerned about what impacts these unfounded actions by the Chinese government will have on Canada’s agriculture and canola sector, especially our local farmers. Approximately 40 percent of Canadian canola exports go to China, with a value of approximately $3.6 billion in 2017.

Canada’s Conservatives have requested an emergency meeting of the Agriculture and Agri-Food Committee to discuss the Liberal government’s lack of action on this important file. Opposition Members also requested an emergency meeting of the International Trade Committee to discuss the Chinese government’s revocation of Richardson International’s export registration. This meeting was held on March 17 and members agreed to invite the Ministers of Agriculture and Agri-Food and International Trade Diversification to appear at committee and discuss what is being done to restore market access to China for Canadian canola. However, the Liberal members of the committee voted down inviting the Minister of Foreign Affairs as a key witness, despite Opposition requests for answers to specifically prevent further retaliatory actions by China against Canada.

It is clear that our agriculture producers are paying for the mistakes of Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government on the world stage. The Liberal government MUST stand up for Canada’s canola industry and demand that the Chinese government stop these baseless actions against Canada’s agriculture sector.

“The Catholic community of the diocese of Quebec shares the pain and suffering of the Muslim families affected by the attack in New Zealand,” said Cardinal Gerald Lacroix of Quebec on Facebook. “Our humble prayer accompanies you. We continue to believe that it is possible to live together in respect and freedom of worship.”

In a rambling online manifesto, the Australian accused in the New Zealand shootings named the Quebec killer among mass murderers who inspired him. Alexandre Bissonnette was convicted of killing six men in the attack on Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre.

In a March 15 letter addressed to Muslim Brothers and Sisters, the president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) Bishop Lionel Gendron of Saint-Jean-Longueuil assured them of the solidarity and support of the Canadian bishops “during this terrifying time.”

“We are horrified that the attack injured and killed so many people, and left behind a feeling of fear and uncertainty in your homes and places of worship,” said Gendron. “For Canadians, and especially Muslim Canadians, this act of horrific violence is a painful reminder to the shooting which took place Jan. 29, 2017.

“As the Muslim communities and the entire population of New Zealand mourn the dead and care for the injured, the Catholic community of Canada extends to you its fraternal proximity and assurance of prayers and support,” he said.

The Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Quebec also reacted quickly with a statement March15 as they wrote they learned “with horror and pain” of the “terrible crime” committed in New Zealand “against people who only prayed” while meeting in their spring plenary in Trois-Rivières.

“The Bishops reaffirm that religious freedom is a fundamental right that everyone has the duty to respect and they unite their voice to all those who denounce and reject violence in all its forms,” the statement said.

“It’s an evil act, for starters,” said Anne Leahy, former Canadian ambassador to the Holy See who is now a professor at McGill University teaching Catholicism and public policy. “It’s something everyone needs to take a stand against.”

Leahy said more needed to be known about the motivations of the young Australian involved in the killings, but has found reports of the killer being motivated by white supremacy “quite worrying.”

“The political leaders can take a stand and condemn this sort of event for what it is, not to fudge it,” she said, noting that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “names the tragedy for what it is, an attack against Muslims.”

“It was an act of hatred against specifically Muslim worshippers,” she said. “We have to name the evil to specifically fight the evil.”

Leahy said the response of Quebec officials two years ago set the right tone. In the immediate aftermath, the mayor of Quebec, the Premier, the Cardinal of Quebec and the Imam of the mosque made “great shows of solidarity,” she said. “Their words, effectively made the right gestures and helped a lot in the healing.”

“That was far more important and relevant to citizens in a given place than debating in parliament.”

The reaction of Quebec after the Quebec shooting was “a cry of conscience,” and “an improvement in the attitude of people towards Muslims who have been living amongst Quebeckers for many years,” Leahy said.

In Toronto, hundreds of Torontonians turned up at Nathan Phillips Square on March 15 in response to the New Zealand shooting.

“The place where you practice your religion should be the place where you feel safest,” Ryerson University political science student Shehaz Shabbir told The Catholic Register.

Whether the massacre had taken place in a church, temple or synagogue, he would have brought his friends from the Ryerson student union to the square in front of City Hall to protest, Shabbir said.

“If something can happen over there, it can happen here as well,” he said.

Fatima Ahmed stood in the rain holding a “United Against Islamophobia” sign with her two young sons, Adam and Yasin, because she felt it was important that her boys see her city, her country and people of good will everywhere are not on the side of hate and violence.

“I’m here to say no to hate,” she said. “We need to know and love each other. I think the problem is that we don’t know each other.”

Representatives of all three levels of government and people representing a wide range of faiths were at the protest quickly organized on social media by TorontoMuslims.com, Muslim Youth Fellowship, Faith in the City and the Urban Alliance on Race Relations.

“Once you get past the utter shock and horror of such a barbaric act of mass murder, you have to focus in on what this man did and what was motivating him,” said Andrew Bennett, former ambassador of religious freedom and now director of the Cardus Religious Freedom Institute. “What was motivating him was evil and hatred of Muslims,” he said. “This man killed 50 people when they were being most fully themselves as human beings from a religious perspective.”

A place of worship, whether a mosque or church or temple, “should be the place where we feel most secure and are able to be most fully ourselves.”

The response has to be greater advocacy for religious freedom, Bennett said. People must be “able to publicly live their faith,” to “publicly worship” and be “free to act on what they believe and what they confess in worship in living out their daily lives.”

A heathy, pluralist society must have broad religious freedom, he said, but we must “draw a very clear distinction between violent acts of hatred which are never acceptable and when people out of genuine belief publicly privately disagree with others about what they believe.”

“The reality is that humans believe very different things, theologically, ethically, ideologically, but if we’re going to have a common life together, if we’re going to live next to one another, we have to be willing to accept difference,” he said.

A key is the respect for the dignity of the individual, despite disagreement. Bennett said Canada’s laws provide penalties for preaching hatred or advocating violence against individuals or a group of people or against the civil order.

However, Bennett said people “should be free to publicly differ about what they believe.”

“As a Catholic, I should have the freedom to publicly say I disagree with Islam,” he said. “I believe Islam is wrong and the fullness of Christ is to be found in Jesus Christ. Likewise, a Muslim friend of mine has every right to say to me, “You’re wrong and I don’t believe Jesus Christ is the incarnate Son of God. He was a prophet.”

“The hard red line is when people begin to advocate violence and open hatred,” he said. “There needs to be proper limits and we have got provisions already within the statutes.”

“There can be no toleration of violent acts against any human being let alone against human beings in public prayer,” Bennett said.

The New Zealand shooter is said to have been radicalized on social media, and that concerns Bennett.

Social media is “where a lot of this stuff thrives,” he said.

“Social media does not build up community; it breaks down community, because you are not in physical proximity to the people you are having a debate with,” he said. “It’s easy to dehumanize the person, when not having physical contact with them.”

“We need to be much more questioning on what is going on in social media, and build up genuine human community in our neighborhoods, not electronically but actually physically present with one another.”

This story was originally published by National Observer. It appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

A surge in US and Canadian oil production over the last decade has added the equivalent of “one Russia or one Saudi Arabia” to the markets—pushing the planet farther away from ever getting a grip on the pollution that is driving climate change.

Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, revealed this fact Feb. 26 while discussing what he saw as a “growing disconnect” between the countless scientific studies calling for a decline in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions—each more urgent than the last—and the fact that pollution continues to rise, hitting a record high last year.

In order to avoid the extreme flooding, drought, heat waves, rainfall, disease outbreaks and other dangers to human health that climate change will provoke, nations must stop burning fossil fuels in sufficient amounts to limit the rise in average surface temperature to below two degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.

The problem, said Birol, is that there is already no more room to increase the amount of pollution that humans add each year to the atmosphere. All of the cars, trucks, power plants, factories and other facilities that have already been built around the world, he said, will eat up the rest of the planet’s so-called “carbon budget”—an expression used to describe the maximum amount of pollution that could be generated if the planet wants to limit the rise of average global temperatures—by 2045.

Canada has committed to investing billions of dollars over the next several years in clean technology that Birol said can take a big bite out of oil demand. For example, the Trudeau government is investing in a national network of electric-charging stations to help precipitate a flood of electric car sales in the 2020s.

The government is also establishing a nationwide price on pollution and is phasing out emissions from coal-fired power generation through regulations by 2030. It is working to expand an international coalition to follow them as rapidly as possible.

But the government also spent billions of dollars to buy the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project, and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi recently announced $1.6 billion in support for the oil and gas sector to expand into new markets. Even Ottawa’s electric-car charging fund is also supporting natural gas refueling stations.

Those waiting in the wings to take power in Canada promise even more fossil fuel exploitation. Official Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has referred to Canada’s oil as the “cleanest” energy in the world, and continues to do so despite petroleum needing to be kept in the ground to keep global warming in check.

The Liberal government does not see a contradiction in all its efforts. It says decarbonization won’t happen overnight, and needs to be encouraged over several years, with the energy sector continuing to receive support in the interim. It sees lower-carbon shifts, such as from diesel to natural gas, as better than doing nothing.

Even so, a report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development describes how clean tech companies in Canada are facing challenges competing on a level playing field with the financially powerful oil and gas sector.

Sohi told National Observer in an interview that a lot of clean tech innovation in Canada relates to the natural resources sector itself, so he saw these developments as not actually “working against each other.”

“You need to basically look at it in a holistic way,” said Sohi. “I think that’s what we are focused on. We are supporting a lot of investment in new technology.”

“Full impact” of oil surge not yet felt

During an Ottawa speech alongside the minister and University of Ottawa professor Monica Gattinger, Birol laid out a stark assessment of the planet’s energy picture, and the uphill battle facing nations in cutting their carbon emissions.

Oil production in North America has more than doubled since 2009, despite Canada promosing to cut its carbon emissions since the 1990s. A decade ago, Birol said, US and Canada together produced roughly 10 million barrels per day of oil, and today that number is roughly 22 million.

The increase in production alone is equal to “one Russia or one Saudi Arabia” in additional output, he said, and an increase in natural gas is a “similar story.”

“I believe the full impact of the North American oil and gas surge has not been felt yet” in terms of energy markets and petro-politics.

“I believe the full impact of the North American oil and gas surge has not been felt yet” in terms of energy markets and petro-politics, said Birol.

In addition, a deluge of new coal power plants that have been built in India, Indonesia and Philippines over the last decade are expected to last another 40 years without intervention, he said, and are already responsible for a third of global carbon emissions.

While coal plants in North America and Europe are typically close to retirement, he said newer plants in Asia aren’t disappearing anytime soon.

This year’s Climatescope survey by BloombergNEF of 103 nations similarly warned that around 86 percent of coal-fired generation under construction is due to come online in the next several years in China, Indonesia, India and South Africa.

But for Birol, an important aspect of the climate change debate is getting overlooked: how current facilities are already clogging up our atmosphere.

“Leave aside for a moment what we are going to build that’s new,” he said. “I asked my colleagues, can you please calculate in the next 25 years, how much emissions will come from existing power plants, existing industrial facilities, existing cars and trucks, throughout their economic lifetime? The answer, ladies and gentlemen, was very depressing.”

A full 95 per cent of the planet’s remaining carbon budget will be eaten up by existing infrastructure, he said.

“We have no room to maneuver, in other words. If we want to be in line with the Paris target, we wouldn’t build any non-zero carbon plants, no new cars, no new factories—and all the ones we have, we shut them down. So of course, that’s practically impossible.”

Getting clean tech off the ground

Most of the world’s nations, including Canada, have committed to the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the global average temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius.

The agreement allows for each country to come up with their own nationally-determined contributions. Canada’s current target is to cut 30 per cent of its emissions below 2005 levels by 2030.

However, each nation’s commitments, added up, are insufficient to keep warming under two degrees, according to the United Nations. The UN’s environment program reported in November that they would result in roughly three degrees of warming by 2100.

And that even assumes countries will be able to meet their own promised targets. Canada, for example, will fall short of its target unless it can close a gap of 79 million tons of carbon pollution.

Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna said in December that she is banking on future technologies, increased use of public transit and future efforts of provinces and territories to close that gap.

Relying on future technology is not entirely pie-in-the-sky thinking. Birol said global electricity demand is growing twice as fast as global energy demand, suggesting the electrification of economies, as a result of digitization and an increasing share of renewables like solar and wind power.

Last year, solar was the largest growing power sector source in the world. Costs have plummeted and many governments are encouraging solar energy adoption. The developing world, in fact, is now deploying more renewables than developed nations. “We are going to see a big role for solar in the years to come,” Birol predicted.

The US $1.1 trillion global low-carbon economy is growing overall, with compound annual growth of four per cent from 2008 to 2015, the IISD reported. But its January report by economist Céline Bak referred to “market failures” in getting clean tech off the ground in Canada.

“Evidence shows that Canada’s array of low-carbon innovation policies can seed a vast nursery of potential trees, and yet few strong oaks have yet emerged,” she wrote.

“Emerging firms are struggling to operate in the low-carbon economy, where prices for the commodities they replace—including energy derived from oil and gas—are volatile and where prices for the pollution they address—such as carbon—remain low and are also subject to volatility.”

Sohi disagreed that clean tech and oil and gas were at loggerheads in the markets.

“I think that the kind of innovation and investment in new technology, or development of new technology that has happened in Canada, a lot of that actually relates to the natural resources sector—the oil and gas sector, the forestry sector or the mining sector,” he said.

“Clean tech is growing, and we will continue to support it.”

“Clean tech is growing, and we will continue to support it,” added the minister. “We are investing in products that allow the testing of solar panels that capture energy on both sides…a project in Halifax that is investing in technologies in tidal power…in Regina that is investing in geothermal….in BC that is testing tech around autonomous vehicles.

“Yes, those technologies take time to be developed, then commercialized, then put into use. I think we are doing whatever we can—and we are doing a lot of investment into fundamental sciences.”

He also referred to the government’s commitment to phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. National Observer reported in February on a letter sent to an Ottawa-based organization that suggested the government was still working on identifying certain subsidies years into its effort.

Sohi promises many more electric car chargers

A key low-carbon transformation is electric vehicles. All the cars in the world consume a fifth of global oil production, so electrification can take a serious bite out of fossil fuels, as long as they’re charged from non-emitting power sources like renewables, hydro or nuclear. In Canada, over four-fifths of the electrical grid is already non-emitting.

“We made a commitment to create more electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country, and we have a plan in place,” said Sohi.

In January, National Observer reported that 45 per cent of the funding in a program that had been described as a boon for electric vehicles, was actually going towards natural gas refueling stations.

Electric vehicle advocates said at the time that they felt slighted that the program wasn’t advancing the cause of electrification as much as it could.

Under the program, the electric vehicle charging stations have cost about $50,000 to install, making them much cheaper than natural gas stations which cost around $1 million each.

Departmental officials stress that the program, funded by the 2016 and 2017 federal budgets, is intended to be a six-year, $182 million undertaking and the government is still in the process of rolling out new applicants.

The $6.5 million that had been given out for natural gas refueling by the end of January already represented a large portion of the $22 million overall that is being allocated to natural gas, they say.

That means that, assuming the program survives federal budget cuts over its six-year lifetime, much more money will end up flowing to zero-emission stations like electric chargers and hydrogen refueling than to natural gas.

“There are a few announcements that have been made—there are a lot of other announcements that are coming in the next number of months,” said Sohi.

“You will see how we are supporting electric vehicle charging infrastructure. We have a process in place, and our department reviews those applications.”",US and Canadian Oil Production Push the Planet’s Climate Goals Out of Reach,Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/03/us-and-canadian-oil-production-push-the-planets-climate-goals-out-of-reach/

Singh won his new Burnaby South ...,"OTTAWA — Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","NDP's Jagmeet Singh steps into the House of Commons, making history",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/ndp-s-jagmeet-singh-steps-into-the-house-of-commons-making-history-1.23667038

The House of Commons is engaged in round-the-clock voting that has kept MPs close to their seats overnight. The Conservative Opposition triggered the voting marathon after the Liberal-dominated justice committee shut down further investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The voting got underway around 6 p.m. ET Wednesday, with members voting on every single line of the Liberal government's spending plans.

Philpott's interview with Maclean's — her first substantial interview since resigning from cabinet earlier this month — set official Ottawa buzzing and is certain to dominate the SNC-Lavalin conversation today.

In the story, the Liberal MP said she had concerns about the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case before the controversy became public in January. She alleged Canadians have been prevented from hearing more about what went on in government circles due to efforts by the Prime Minister's Office to ""shut down the story.""

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,"" Philpott said.

MPs are beging a marathon voting session expected to go through the night 1:06

""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.""

'Waste of public funds:' May

The opposition wants the Liberal government to fully waive cabinet confidence restrictions and allow former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to return to committee to answer questions about her decision to resign from cabinet in February.

Wilson-Raybould has alleged that officials in the Prime Minister's Office and elsewhere in government inappropriately pressured her to clear a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin — which would have allowed the company to avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges. In January, she was shuffled out of her cabinet post — a move she said was punishment for not following the PMO's marching orders.

This morning, Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre raised the interview on a point of order, arguing Liberals MPs should reverse their decision to halt the justice committee's SNC-Lavalin inquiry.

""As much as I agree with the motivation of my friends in the Conservative Party, this is a huge waste of public funds and resources,"" said Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, referring to the voting marathon.

Now is normally the time when government MPs fan out across the country to sell their constituents on a new budget. But because each of these votes deals with fiscal matters, they're considered votes of confidence.

Losing a confidence vote can trigger a general election. So Liberal MPs will want to stick close to their desks — although Trudeau was able to sneak away to Mississauga, Ont., today for an infrastructure announcement before returning to his seat.

On Wednesday, the Conservatives put forward a motion calling on the government to have the Commons ""take note"" of Wilson-Raybould's comments about the SNC-Lavalin affair, and asking the prime minister to waive solicitor-client privilege to allow her to speak publicly about the January cabinet shuffle.

That was voted down by the Liberal majority.

Last week, upset with the government's handling of the SNC Lavalin affair, the Tories put forward 257 separate motions to oppose specific proposed funding allotments in the supplementary and interim estimates, two pieces of legislation now being debated in the House of Commons.

""We are prepared to vote on every single one of the 257 motions we have tabled,"" said Kelsie Chiasson, a spokesperson for the Office of the Leader of the Official Opposition. ""Whether we do or not will be up to the Liberals. All they have to do is waive privilege and let Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak.""

Cots have been brought into the West Block to allow members to sleep in shifts and multiple MPs have already been called out for sneaking food and wearing sweatshirts in the House. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, who gave birth last year, has taken to her Instagram to document all the times she's had to leave the floor to pump breast milk.

Since the voting has extended past 10 a.m., Thursday's agenda has been preempted.

Philpott, who resigned from cabinet over the government’s handling of the subsequent public scandal, acknowledged she was damaging the party she wishes to run for in this year’s federal election. Asked Thursday how Philpott could remain in Liberal caucus while knowingly hurting the government’s chance at re-election, Trudeau said that the Liberals recognize “diversity of perspectives, of experiences, of opinions us extraordinarly important.” “Within the same party we can have, absolutely, differences of opinion,” Trudeau told reporters at a press conference in Mississauga.

“But on the big things, the matters of investing in the middle class, moving forward on reconciliation, protecting our environment and growing our economy at the same time, everyone in the Liberal Party believes in that.” On SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau’s opinion differs quite substantially Philpott’s. Philpott, a Markham MP who resigned her cabinet post over the government’s handling of the SNC story, told Maclean’s that she “felt there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system.” Philpott did not elaborate. She said she had “further issues of concern that (she’s) not free to share,” presumably due to the convention of cabinet confidence. An interview request to her Ottawa office was not returned Thursday. But her comments breathe new life into a story that has dogged Justin Trudeau’s government for almost two months.

“I resigned because I could not maintain solidarity with cabinet on the specific issue of the management of the SNC-Lavalin issue,” Philpott told Maclean’s. “I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

At issue is allegations made by former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould that senior members of Trudeau’s staff — including the country’s former top bureaucrat, both of Trudeau’s closest advisors, and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s chief of staff — attempted to improperly pressure her to give SNC-Lavalin a “deferred prosecution agreement,” or DPA. The construction and engineering firm, which employs thousands in Ontario and Quebec, is facing criminal bribery and fraud charges related to work it conducted in Libya from 2001 to 2011. If convicted, the firm would be barred from bidding on federal contracts for a decade. In a series of media interviews Wednesday, SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce expressed frustration that despite major corporate reforms, his company was denied a DPA and will likely go to trial. Philpott told Maclean’s that she believes Wilson-Raybould has “further points to make.” In his testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, Trudeau’s close friend and former personal secretary Gerald Butts said that when Trudeau raised the idea of moving Wilson-Raybould out of the justice portfolio with Philpott in January, she warned him the former Attorney General might perceive it as a result of her refusal to cut SNC a deal. Philpott, a friend of Wilson-Raybould who was photographed sitting with the former justice minister at an Ottawa restaurant on Tuesday, raised that conversation in her interview with Maclean’s. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public know about (the SNC-Lavalin story),” Philpott said. “Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?” Philpott acknowledged that she has done damage to the Liberal government — while still wanting to run as a Liberal — through her resignation from cabinet and her public disapproval of how the government has managed the SNC-Lavalin file. “This has hurt people, and I feel really sad about that,” Philpott told Maclean’s. “And I’m really sorry that I had to do it, because there are people who are afraid that they’re not going to get elected because of what I did.” The Conservatives forced Liberal and NDP MPs to stay overnight in the House of Commons Wednesday in an attempt to force the government to resume a probe into the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Liberal MPs on the justice committee voted to close down that probe Tuesday, after hearing from Wilson-Rabould, Butts, and former top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who resigned in the wake of his testimony.

In a interview with Maclean’s Magazine, published Thursday morning, former president of the Treasury Board Jane Philpott explained her decision to resign as a cabinet member and said that “there’s been an attempt to shut down the story” by Trudeau and his advisers.

At issue is the claim by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that she was subjected to a “consistent and sustained effort” between September and December 2018 to pressure her into changing her decision not to intervene in the criminal case of SNC-Lavalin to help the Montreal firm escape a potential conviction for corruption charges.

Trudeau said in his view, Wilson-Raybould has been allowed to speak already.

“The issue is the issue of pressure that the attorney general may have experienced while she was attorney general on SNC Lavalin,” Trudeau said when asked repeatedly about the assertions.

He added that he thinks Wilson-Raybould has been able to give “full testimony regarding the former attorney general’s time as attorney general in regards to the Lavalin situation.”

Trudeau waived cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege following intense pressure from critics demanding answers to the allegations.

But the waiver for Wilson-Raybould only allowed her to speak about what happened while she was attorney general.

She was shuffled out of that post on Jan. 14, 2019, something she says she believes was a direct result of refusing to intervene to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal.

However, she remained a member of the cabinet in her new position of minister of veterans affairs until she resigned on Feb. 12.

That means if there were any further discussions of the SNC-Lavalin case around the cabinet table, Wilson-Raybould would likely have heard it up until she resigned. A waiver covering her final month in cabinet would authorize her to speak about whether there were ongoing discussions on the matter.

Attorney General David Lametti, who replaced her in the job, has refused to rule out offering the company a deal to avoid a criminal trial and potential conviction.

Philpott resigned following the testimony of Wilson-Raybould at the House of Commons justice committee that had been conducting a limited probe of the matter up until it decided to drop its examination of the issue on Monday.

Philpott said in her resignation letter that she had “lost confidence” in the prime minister’s handling of the allegations.

While she has remained tight-lipped since then, her interview with Maclean’s marked the first time she has publicly commented on her ongoing concerns.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,” Philpott told Maclean’s in her first extended interview since her resignation.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

Philpott’s new public statements fanned the flames of a scandal the government is desperate to douse, and which the Opposition Conservatives are doing their best to keep alive. They’ve forced the House of Commons to sit all night, voting line by line on the Liberal government’s spending plans.

The Liberal majority in the House shot down a Conservative motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to let Wilson-Raybould testify more fully about what she experienced through the fall and into the early winter, especially what prompted her to resign from cabinet altogether after she was shuffled from the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in January.

The motion was defeated by a vote of 161-134, with both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould absent.

That set the stage for the Conservative-sponsored filibuster that began Wednesday night and continued through Thursday morning.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force to avoid potential defeat of the government. The voting could theoretically last 36 hours, but the Conservatives have only to keep it going until just after 10 a.m. today to scrub the remainder of the parliamentary day.

A day of committee meetings scheduled for Thursday has already been cancelled.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has brushed aside calls from former cabinet minister Jane Philpott to waive all cabinet and solicitor-client privileges to allow former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak freely about the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Ms. Philpott told Maclean’s magazine in an interview published on Thursday that Canadians need to know “the whole story” of what she called an “attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial” of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Philpott resigned earlier this month as President of the Treasury Board, citing a lack of confidence in the way the Prime Minister handled the SNC-Lavalin matter.

The political controversy has resulted in the resignations of four high-profile members of the Trudeau government and manoeuvres by the opposition to disrupt Parliament in protest of a decision by the Liberal-dominated House of Commons justice committee to shut down its inquiry into the matter.

Conservative MPs forced marathon votes on spending estimates Wednesday night that are expected to take up most of Thursday and force the cancellation of the Commons Question Period.

In testimony before the justice committee last month, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top aides including the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, to grant a deferred prosecution agreement to the Montreal engineering and construction company, which is facing bribery and fraud charges related to business dealings in Libya.

The B.C. Liberal MP has said she wanted to return for a second round of testimony to explain what transpired between when she was moved out of the justice portfolio in early January and her resignation from cabinet on Feb. 11.

She has asked the Prime Minister to give her another waiver from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to talk about conversations with Mr. Trudeau that led to her resignation from cabinet.

“If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories,” Ms. Philpott said to Maclean’s. “My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole truth.”

At an event in Mississauga, Mr. Trudeau told reporters he already granted an unprecedented waiver to Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she could provide testimony about the political pressure she said was exerted between September and December 2018 to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

“The issue was pressure around SNC-Lavalin while she was attorney-general and she got to speak fully to do that,” Mr. Trudeau said in dismissing requests he allow her to speak about the period after she was shuffled out of Justice.

This week, the government has tried to shift the political focus from the SNC-Lavalin affair to the budget. The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the former attorney-general to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout from The Globe report, Mr. Trudeau has lost the two ministers as well as his principal secretary, Gerald Butts. On Monday, Mr. Wernick retired as Canada’s top bureaucrat, saying he has lost the “trust and respect"" of the opposition parties over his role in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

On Tuesday, Liberal MPs on the justice committee shut down hearings on the SNC-Lavalin matter, preventing Ms. Wilson-Raybould from returning to testify.

Liberal MPs are also expected to use their majority on the House ethics committee to block an attempt by Conservative and NDP members to mount an inquiry and have Ms. Wilson-Raybould testify.

SNC-Lavalin never claimed jobs were at risk, CEO Neil Bruce says

In the Maclean’s interview, Ms. Philpott said she is also keen to have cabinet privileges waived so she could talk about a Dec. 6 meeting with the Prime Minister when they discussed his plans to shuffle Ms. Wilson-Raybould out of the post of justice minister and attorney-general.

“I spoke to the Prime Minister on January the 6th about SNC-Lavalin’s desire to have a DPA [deferred prosecution agreement],” she said. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister. … Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?”

Mr. Trudeau had a different interpretation of that meeting, saying it was about Ms. Philpott’s move from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board President and his plan to have Ms. Wilson-Raybould take over her portfolio.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her, ‘No it was not,’” he said. “She then mentioned it may be a challenge for Jody-Wilson Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services.”

Mr. Trudeau said he asked Ms. Philpott “for her help, and she gladly offered"" to help convince Ms. Wilson-Raybould to take the position. A former B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ms. Wilson-Raybould turned down the job because she did not want to oversee the Indian Act.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould was then shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14, which she said she believed was related to her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

Ms. Philpott said Ms. Wilson-Raybould was subjected to “bullying or harassment” from the Prime Minister’s Office to overrule federal prosecutors and negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

“The former AG didn’t want to override that, and she had her finger in the dike and said no repeatedly,"" Ms. Philpott said.

In the aftermath of Ms. Philpott’s interview, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh renewed calls on Thursday for a judicial inquiry.

""Give us the independence of a judge that is not limited by a Liberal-dominated committee, where a judge has the independence to ask all witnesses all the questions necessary so Canadians can learn the truth,” he said. “If the Prime Minister was co-operative, the public inquiry would not take very long.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hoping the festivities would distract from Jody Wilson-Raybould and the SNC-Lavalin scandal after the Liberal-majority justice committee ruled against letting the former attorney general speak again, effectively shutting down the committee investigating the issue.

However, it appears once the pomp and circumstance of the budget have faded, Canadians will still want answers that only Wilson-Raybould and the PM can provide.

In other words, this is not going away.

One of those questions is why the former attorney general was fired, although the reason appears to be because she wouldn’t give SNC-Lavalin the get-out-of-jail-free card the Liberals wanted in order to secure their votes in Quebec.

Another is whether current Attorney General David Lametti will do what Wilson-Raybould refused to do and grant the Liberals their wish.

Liberal supporters have said it is the Opposition and those who simply dislike Trudeau who are keeping this story alive for political gain.

I would disagree with that.

It is the Liberals who are keeping this story alive by failing to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak and by continuing to drag out the narrative on a daily basis with their shabby handling of the affair.

Delaying the justice committee’s decision not to let Wilson-Raybould speak until the day of the budget and the sudden early retirement of Michael Wernick, the supposedly unbiased clerk of the Privy Council (who got to testify twice), are just two of the latest examples of keeping this story in the headlines.

SNC-Lavalin's local ...,"SNC-Lavalin's local employees will be forced to work for foreign competitors if the embattled engineering firm is barred from bidding on federal contracts, diminishing its role as rare Canadian global champion, the company's CEO said Wednesday.

""There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They'll get a job,"" Neil Bruce said in an interview with The Canadian Press.

Unlike the Trudeau government, he said the Montreal-based company has never cited the protection of 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason it should be granted a remediation agreement to avoid a criminal trial.

""This thing that somehow they're going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.""

However, he says there's a public interest for such an agreement because its well-qualified employees will be forced to work for U.S. or European competitors if it is barred from bidding on federal contracts for a decade.

Analysts have countered that argument, pointing out that more than half of those 9,000 workers are currently engaged in multi-billion dollar construction projects that are years from completion, and that it's unlikely SNC will be prevented from bidding on provincial contracts.

SNC-Lavalin faces accusations it paid bribes to get government business in Libya — a criminal case that has triggered a political storm and cost Prime Minister Justin Trudeau two cabinet ministers and his most trusted adviser.

Bruce said about 75 per cent of the company's rivals have concluded deferred prosecution agreements in their host countries and are free to work in Canada.

Meanwhile, Bruce said he still doesn't know why the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould were not open to granting a remediation agreement.

He said SNC-Lavalin employees feel bruised and battered by the last six weeks since a report surfaced that government officials pressured the former attorney general to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

""And I think fundamentally that's unfair on our employees who had nothing to do with what went on seven to 20 years ago.""

While he's not surprised that politicians would make hay out of this issue during an election year, Bruce said he's concerned that policymakers haven't been as willing as other countries to defend home-grown companies and their workers.

He said there's no plans to move the company's headquarters from Montreal, adding competitors are envious of its shareholder base that is 82 per cent Canadian and led by the Caisse de depot which has helped fund its acquisition of British engineering firm Atkins.

TORONTO — The chief executive of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. says he never cited the protection of 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason the company should be granted a remediation agreement to avoid a criminal trial on allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Neil Bruce said Wednesday if the engineering firm is convicted and barred from bidding on federal contracts here at home its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company's foreign rivals.

""There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They'll get a job,"" Bruce said.

""This thing that somehow they're going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.""

Bruce's comments come as a political storm in Ottawa continues over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to end a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau and his staff have said their only concern was for SNC-Lavalin's 9,000 jobs, which might be at risk if the company were convicted and then barred from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and the country's top public servant, although he continues to insist no one did anything wrong.

Bruce said its Canadian workforce has decreased from 20,000 in 2012 and will likely fall further. That, despite it being the only Canadian company that does nuclear technology work helping Ontario facilities like Chalk River, Darlington and Pickering. Also, no other domestic firm does the scope of infrastructure services on projects in cities like Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.

He said the company has calculated that about 75 per cent of its rivals have concluded deferred prosecution agreements (DPA) in their host countries and are free to work in Canada.

Meanwhile, Bruce said he still doesn't know why the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould were not open to granting a remediation agreement.

He said the company appealed that decision in Federal Court, hoping to learn some of the rationale.

""We did an appeal not because we thought we would win the appeal but because we thought we might get a reason and that got tossed out with no reason so we still don't know.""

Bruce said he's not holding much hope that an agreement will be offered under the current political climate, especially if the Conservatives win the fall election, and is preparing for a lengthy legal process.

""We have never asked for the charges to be dropped, we've never asked for anything to be circumvented,"" he said. ""We just want to move on for the sake principally of our employees first and foremost and our investors.""

A main stumbling block to getting a DPA could be public perception that former employees accused of crimes aren't being held accountable, he said.

He said innocent SNC-Lavalin employees feel bruised and battered by the last six weeks since a report surfaced that government officials pressured the former attorney general to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

""And I think fundamentally that's unfair on our employees who had nothing to do with what went on seven to 20 years ago.""

While he's not surprised that politicians would make hay out of this issue during an election year, Bruce said he's concerned the company will continue to be a political punching bag as the campaign unfolds.

""If it sort of doesn't move on from that or gets worse of course it's a concern.""

Bruce also said few people have publicly defended the company's important contribution to the country as a home-grown success story.

""So if anybody's happy for us not being able to do that work and give it to the Americans or give it to the Europeans I think that's a sad, sad position.""

He said there's no plans to move the company's headquarters from Montreal, adding competitors are envious of its shareholder base that is 82 per cent Canadian and led by the Caisse de depot which has helped fund its acquisition of British engineering firm Atkins.

""We see ourselves as Team Canada. We are a global champion, one of few. There's not many and we're proud to be Canadian.""

As a 23-year employee of SNC-Lavalin, I cannot tell you anything about the current debate swirling in Ottawa around my company.

What I can tell you is, I and my many colleagues across Canada and around the world, wouldn’t still be working at SNC-Lavalin if we didn’t believe it was a world-class engineering, construction management and operations and maintenance company with the kinds of values — an emphasis on safety, integrity, innovation and collaboration — that align with our own.

A lot is being said about SNC-Lavalin, that it is “scandal-plagued” and “corrupt.” That is not what I see or live day to day at SNC-Lavalin. My colleagues, including the nearly 2,800 working in Ontario, are honest, hard-working and talented professionals.

They are engineers, experts in 3D computerized drafting systems, safety and quality assurance professionals, construction supervisors, and lawyers and accountants who take great pride in working on complex and meaningful projects that help make Ontario a better place to live and work.

Our work is not always visible, but it is integral to the infrastructure of this province. It includes extending the life of the OPG Darlington and Bruce CANDU nuclear power plants, which produce 60 per cent of Ontario’s power; a major air quality improvement project in Sudbury that has dramatically reduced emissions from smelting operations, and maintaining back up power for Toronto’s Pearson Airport.

We are part of the consortium building the Eglinton Crosstown LRT in Toronto, operate a number of courthouses across the province, and our team in Ottawa maintains about 100 of the Canadian Navy’s auxiliary fleet off both coasts.

We continue to work hard and to persevere. But I won’t lie. These past few years, never mind the last few weeks, have been extremely difficult for morale. Our competitors exploit the challenges the company has faced to dissuade clients from hiring us, our clients and business partners insist on greater guarantees to work with us, and we have lost talent.

What is harder to quantify is the deep personal toll this situation has taken on each one of us, as the daily media onslaught looks to put a malignant spin on anything associated with SNC-Lavalin. Every past transgression is being dredged up as if it is a reflection of the company today. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I am in no way minimizing the mistakes of the past. And I can assure you that if Canadians are disappointed in the behaviour of a small number of former senior leaders, then SNC-Lavalin employees, who put their trust and professional credibility in their hands, feel that disappointment all the more keenly.

Like all Canadians and employees, I seek justice, where the prosecutors are determined to bring to court the wrongdoers, who have all left the company years ago and let the company and its innocent employees grow and prosper to the benefit of all.

What I and my colleagues don’t understand, however, is why armchair pundits, media and our politicians insist on punishing us a second time. A company is not some disembodied entity. It is nothing more than its employees, and its shareholders. To destroy the company, is to destroy the thousands of well-paying jobs that go with it, along with the savings of hard-working Canadians and pensioners.

Some argue that the impacts to SNC-Lavalin or the Canadian economy are overstated. But to hypothesize that the company could survive a 10-year ban on federal contracts is to miss the point; it is the uncertainty, caused by years of protracted legal proceedings, that causes the harm. We have seen the evidence of that already.

Our Canadian employee base has shrunk from 20,000 to 8,500 in just five years, and we have lost some $5 billion in business, with a large impact on our supply chain as well — and that was before the events of the last month.

Others argue that our jobs will simply be filled by “the market.” To a degree that may be true. What is also true is that we are the only Canadian company that has the scale, breadth of expertise and financial strength to bid on the country’s largest and most complex projects. Without us, that void will be filled by foreign companies employing foreign engineers.

Furthermore, a majority of SNC-Lavalin’s revenues are earned outside Canada. If SNC-Lavalin is brought down, that overseas work, presently serviced in part by engineers and other professionals from Canada, will in future be done by foreign competitors — not by Canadians.

It took more than 100 years to build SNC-Lavalin to what it is today. And we all know that Canada only has a few truly global champions that are leaders in their industries. SNC-Lavalin is one of them. Why would we throw away all that homegrown expertise, know-how, and talent that has taken generations to build?

I am a proud Canadian; I love our country and our values, which is why this has been so difficult. No other country seems to beat up on its own homegrown talent as we do in Canada, and for what reason, and for what gain? It is of no benefit to Canada, our companies or the people who work for them.

If it's convicted of fraud and bribery charges, SNC-Lavalin could end up being taken over by another company and its 9,000 jobs in Canada could move abroad, the engineering firm's CEO told Radio-Canada in an interview today.

""If we were convicted further down the line … if we're barred from doing federal work, then the people doing federal work today will have to do something else. That may be in Canada or it may be outside Canada,"" Neil Bruce said.

Analysts have countered that argument, pointing out that more than half of those 9,000 workers are currently engaged in multi-billion dollar construction projects that are years from completion, and that it's unlikely SNC will be prevented from bidding on provincial contracts.

He also said that while he never told officials in the Prime Minister's Office that a federal prosecution would leave SNC-Lavalin vulnerable to a foreign takeover, it's a possibility.

Bruce said that over the past year, the company's stock value has dropped by 25 per cent. It first took a hit of 10 per cent when it disclosed that its work in Saudi Arabia — where it also employs 9,000 people — was drying up.

SNC Lavalin saw a further 15 per cent drop in its share price, Bruce said, when it announced it was not going to be permitted to deal with bribery and fraud charges through a new Canadian law that would allow the company to escape prosecution by meeting conditions laid out in a remediation agreement.

""So 25 per cent off, in terms of the value of the company, in a period where our earnings and our revenues and our backlog are pretty stable,"" he said, arguing that the depressed share price doesn't reflect the company's true value — which could make it a ripe target for a takeover bid.

""Ultimately, people will look at it and say, 'Well, SNC Lavalin is worth more than the current share price.'""

Bruce said that he met Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on three occasions and the Opposition leader was ""very supportive"" of the company.

Scheer has since been tearing into the Liberals daily over the SNC-Lavalin scandal — which was touched off by former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's allegation that officials in the Prime Minister's Office and elsewhere in government inappropriately pressured her to clear a remediation agreement for the company. In January, she was shuffled out of her cabinet post — a move she said was punishment for not following the PMO's marching orders.

Bruce said he now finds Scheer's public position on his company difficult to understand.

""I am quite puzzled in terms of the position,"" Bruce said. ""I mean, I understand the politics of it but in terms of looking at ... you know it's not just about jobs, it's actually about people. We've got 9,000 employees that feel quite bitter about this.""

Company could 'eventually' leave Canada

Liberal MPs on the justice committee voted yesterday to end the committee's inquiry into Wilson-Raybould's claim.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould, but the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is proceeding with his own inquiry into the matter. Gerry Butts, the former principal secretary to Trudeau, said Wilson-Raybould was not removed from the justice ministry as a punishment.

Bruce said that while he did not tell PMO officials a failure to secure a remediation agreement could see the company relocate abroad, it could happen.

""It's not something that we are currently looking at. But if you look at every eventuality, then part of it is really about emphasizing probably doing more work outside the country then we are currently capable of doing.""

He also said that 82 per cent of the company's shares are owned by Canadians and that there are advantages to being based in Montreal. But for now, the company's priority is to build a defence they can present in a court of law.

""We want to be able to address the issues of the past and be clear. We have apologized on a number of occasions for what went on prior to 2013.

After months of media scrutiny and cabinet drama, Justin Trudeau’s government is in serious hot water over the now infamous bribery case.

So far this year, SNC-Lavalin stock is down 22%, while in the same period, the TSX has risen about 14%. It’s clear that market sentiment is turning against this company. The question is this: is it time to buy the dip or time to avoid SNC-Lavalin stock altogether?

To answer that question, we need to look at how the scandal is playing out for SNC-Lavalin so far.

SNC-Lavalin charges





On February 19, the RCMP filed a number of charges against SNC-Lavalin. If succcessful, they could result in the company being barred from bidding on federal contracts for 10 years. That’s a serious penalty.

According to recent reports, one third of SNC-Lavalin’s revenue comes from within Canada, and much of that comes from federal projects. Not being able to bid on Canadian projects could therefore hurt the company’s bottom line. Any fines or financial penalties resulting from the case would be an additional kick in the teeth.

The big question is whether the company actually gets in any trouble. As a recent CBC story points out, the RCMP has been investigating SNC-Lavalin for years, and so far, not a single charge has stuck.

Although the current scandal has undoubtedly harmed SNC-Lavalin’s reputation and empowered its competitors to play the “clean” card, it’s not clear whether the company will ever face a true legal penalty.

Fundamentals

That said, SNC-Lavalin’s fundamentals aren’t in great shape right now. In its most recent quarter, the company posted a net loss of $1.3 billion, down from a $380 million profit in the same quarter a year before.

The loss was mainly attributed to a $1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge in its oil & gas business, as the company reduced its estimated goodwill due to unpredictable commodity prices and deteriorating intergovernmental relations with Saudi Arabia. On the bright side, the company’s outlook was positive, aiming for $2-$2.50 in diluted EPS for 2019.

Could the scandal hurt the stock?

Now for the big question:

Will the ongoing scandal hurt SNC-Lavalin stock enough to make it a sell?

So far, it looks like the scandal has already sent the stock lower, as most of this year’s losses occurred before the quarterly report that revealed the massive $1.3 billion loss. Whether the sell-off was just short-sighted market sentiment or something with long-term implications remains to be seen.

Ultimately it depends on whether any of the RCMP’s charges against the company stick. If they do, then that 10-year moratorium on bidding will almost certainly hurt SNC-Lavalin’s long-term stock performance.

421,Politics,2019-03-21T17:10:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA — Former cabinet minister Jane Philpott, who resigned over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, is publicly calling on the government to allow for more ...","OTTAWA — Former cabinet minister Jane Philpott, who resigned over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, is publicly calling on the government to allow for more testimony on the events, saying there is “much more to the story that should be told.”

Philpott’s comments come in an interview with Maclean’s magazine that was published Thursday morning — in the midst of an all-night voting marathon in the House of Commons as the Conservatives protest the shutdown of justice committee testimony on the affair. The Conservatives forced the vote marathon after the Liberals defeated a motion calling on Trudeau to waive privilege over further testimony from former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Having served as health minister, Indigenous services minister, and president of the treasury board, Philpott was one of Trudeau’s most trusted cabinet ministers before she resigned on Mar. 4. When she resigned, she said she’d lost confidence in how the government was handling allegations that political pressure was inappropriately put Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin corruption prosecution.

I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial

In the interview, she said that while resigning was very difficult and while she still supports the Liberal Party, she felt she could not remain in cabinet.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history,” Philpott said.

She also slammed Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who had suggested Philpott resigned in solidarity because Wilson-Raybould was her friend.

“I think that’s an insult,” Philpott told Maclean’s. “I don’t make decisions on any policy — and definitely not on a matter of principle — based on friendship. I made the very difficult decision to step down because my conscience demanded it.”

Philpott said that the testimony that has come out so far — including one appearance by Wilson-Raybould at the Commons justice committee — has not given the public the whole story.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” she said. “I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share.”

She also cited justice committee testimony from Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who also resigned as the SNC-Lavalin scandal unfolded, in which Butts alluded to a Jan. 6 conversation between Philpott and Trudeau about the company’s eagerness to be offered a remediation agreement instead of facing prosecution. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister a month before the public knew about it,” she told Maclean’s. “Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former Minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?”

Her comments add pressure to the Liberals to provide another venue for Philpott or Wilson-Raybould to speak. It also puts pressure on senators as the upper chamber considers its own study of the issue, though debate there has become bogged down and it’s not clear when a vote will take place.

Philpott told Maclean’s that although parliamentary privilege technically allows her or Wilson-Raybould to speak on the matter in the House of Commons, it would be difficult to get enough time to properly tell the story.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,” she said. “I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

She also said she felt an obligation to the people in her riding, saying “they have understandably been concerned about why there’s been an attempt to shut down the story.”

Speaking to reporters on Thursday after the interview was published, Trudeau defended his decision to only waive privilege for Wilson-Raybould’s testimony before she was removed as justice minister, saying the crux of the issue is whether she was pressured in her role as attorney general. Wilson-Raybould has pointed to the fact the waiver does not allow her to discuss conversations that happened after she was shuffled out of the job, hinting there is more to say about it.

“We granted an unprecedented waiver to allow for fulsome testimony at the justice committee so that people could be heard on this matter as fully possible, and that’s exactly why we’re pleased with the work done by the justice committee, and that will be done by the ethics committee,” Trudeau said.

He also provided some detail about his conversation with Philpott on Jan. 6, describing it as a “good and positive conversation.” He said the discussion was focused on moving Philpott from Indigenous services to treasury board, but also about moving Wilson-Raybould out of justice and potentially into Indigenous services.

“(Philpott) asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin issue, and I told her no, it was not,” Trudeau said. “She then mentioned that it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous services, and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give, in explaining to Jody Wilson-Raybould how exciting this job is and what a great thing it would be for her to have that role for reconciliation, for the government, and that it would be a very positive thing.”

In his testimony to the justice committee, Gerald Butts — Trudeau’s former principal secretary — explained why Wilson-Raybould rejected the move to Indigenous services and was moved to veterans affairs instead. “She said she had spent her life opposed to the Indian Act and couldn’t be in charge of the programs administered under its authority,” Butts told the committee.

Trudeau was also asked on Thursday why Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are still in the Liberal caucus, given the trouble they are causing for his government.

“They have indicated they want to serve as Liberal members, they want to continue to run in the next election as Liberal members of parliament, and that they share the goals we have and the focus we have,” he said. He added later that he is “pleased to have a diversity of voices within the Liberal Party.”

As the Commons sat through Wednesday night and into Thursday morning, neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould have been on the Liberal benches.

In a media availability on Thursday morning, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel accused Trudeau of hypocrisy for championing women’s rights, but blocking the ability of Wilson-Raybould or Philpott to tell more of the story.

“Any Canadian woman regardless of (political) stripe should be outraged at what is happening to these women,” Rempel said. “It’s disgusting.”

Without a DPA, SNC-Lavalin would face a 10-year ban on federal contracts if convicted of the criminal charges it faces. The company's CEO, Neil Bruce, who took over in 2015, says it has turned over a new leaf and a prosecution would only punish ""innocent employees.""

Deal for SNC-Lavalin could still be on the table, says Trudeau's public services minister

Here's what a 10-year ban on federal contract bids would mean for SNC-Lavalin

Would 9,000 people actually lose their jobs if SNC-Lavalin were convicted of these criminal charges?

Very likely not. SNC-Lavalin employs roughly 9,000 people in Canada, in a variety of roles. All of them would not disappear, experts say; the company pulling out of Canada entirely would be a worst-case scenario. Employees dedicated to projects other than federal contracts would be obligated to finish that work. Plus, experts say, even if thousands of Canadians lose their jobs at SNC-Lavalin, most of them would probably be hired by other companies.

Read more:So, about those 9,000 SNC-Lavalin jobs

What makes SNC-Lavalin so special? What about jobs lost at other companies?

For one, a lot of jobs (theoretically — see above) are at stake. For another, the Quebec-based company that employs so many people is a point of pride in the province — a province whose votes are critical to any party that wants to win a federal election, particularly the Liberals who may lose seats in Alberta. Experts suggest there was more of an appetite for offering a DPA to SNC-Lavalin in Quebec, which would suffer the brunt of potential job losses.

SNC-Lavalin is also a frequent lobbyist in Ottawa and was pushing for deferred prosecution agreements to be introduced to begin with.

According to Bloomberg, CEO Neil Bruce or other executives had 59 meetings, calls or encounters with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's inner circle over the past 12 months, according to Canada's lobbyist registry. That group included Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff, Ben Chin, and Mathieu Bouchard, a senior adviser to Trudeau. All three were among the people Wilson-Raybould said had contacted her or her staff to advocate for SNC-Lavalin.

Bruce also wrote to Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough on Oct. 13, 2017, pressing the need for DPAs to put the Canadian company on equal footing with those in other countries that already had such legislation. The company was among the stakeholders involved in public consultations on the remediation tool. Bruce also wrote a letter to Trudeau about DPAs on Oct. 15, 2018.

Canada's former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressured by the Prime Minister's Office on the issue of SNC-Lavalin. What actually constitutes illegal pressure?

First, Wilson-Raybould said she believes the pressure on her was ""inappropriate"" but not illegal.

However, in February Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on the RCMP to investigate whether anyone broke the law in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. He pointed to two sections of the Criminal Code: one that prohibits conduct meant to provoke fear in the attorney general, and another that says it's against the law to try to obstruct justice.

It's a major allegation but it's unclear whether any laws were actually broken in the SNC-Lavalin case.

Was it interference? We asked experts to analyze Jody Wilson-Raybould's statement on SNC-Lavalin

What would the opposition parties have done in this situation?

No one can say for sure, of course, but NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in early March that he would never have let SNC-Lavalin hold sway over his government. Scheer, meanwhile, has been hammering the Trudeau government over the scandal, calling for a police investigation to determine whether there was illegal pressure on the attorney general.

However, Scheer did meet with SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce in May 2018 to discuss the deferred prosecution agreement the company sought. Brock Harrison, Scheer's director of communications, said ""the meeting was one of several SNC-Lavalin sought out and held with MPs from all parties during the budget debate.""

But when asked if Scheer thought SNC-Lavalin should get such a deal, Harrison would only say that Scheer ""is opposed to politicians interfering to get charges dropped for accused corporate criminals.""

How are other countries likely to react to this scandal and its implications?

The allegations that Trudeau and senior officials tried to interfere in the criminal case against SNC-Lavalin have already caught the eye of an international economic organization that oversees global anti-bribery efforts. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) pointedly warned Canada about its obligations to safeguard independent prosecutions.

""We are not so much interested in the decision of the prosecutor, this agreement or not. That has to be an autonomous decision of the prosecutor which should not be influenced by anybody,"" said Drago Kos, the chair of the OECD working group on bribery.

Ross Marowits, The Canadian Press





""There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They'll get a job,"" Neil Bruce said in an interview with The Canadian Press.

Unlike the Trudeau government, he said the Montreal-based company has never cited the protection of 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason it should be granted a remediation agreement to avoid a criminal trial.

""This thing that somehow they're going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.""

However, he says there's a public interest for such an agreement because its well-qualified employees will be forced to work for U.S. or European competitors if it is barred from bidding on federal contracts for a decade.

SNC-Lavalin faces accusations it paid bribes to get government business in Libya -- a criminal case that has triggered a political storm and cost Prime Minister Justin Trudeau two cabinet ministers and his most trusted adviser.

Bruce said about 75 per cent of the company's rivals have concluded deferred prosecution agreements in their host countries and are free to work in Canada.

Meanwhile, Bruce said he still doesn't know why the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould were not open to granting a remediation agreement.

He said SNC-Lavalin employees feel bruised and battered by the last six weeks since a report surfaced that government officials pressured the former attorney general to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

""And I think fundamentally that's unfair on our employees who had nothing to do with what went on seven to 20 years ago.""

While he's not surprised that politicians would make hay out of this issue during an election year, Bruce said he's concerned that policymakers haven't been as willing as other countries to defend home-grown companies and their workers.

He said there's no plans to move the company's headquarters from Montreal, adding competitors are envious of its shareholder base that is 82 per cent Canadian and led by the Caisse de depot which has helped fund its acquisition of British engineering firm Atkins.

The move comes just one day after the Liberals quashed the justice committee study of the affair.

""Canadians deserve to hear the full truth. Unfortunately, the Liberal majority on the Justice Committee seems determined not to hear any further from Ms. Wilson-Raybould,"" reads a letter from Conservative MPs Peter Kent and Jacques Gourde, which was addressed to the Conservative chair of the ethics committee.

The letter calls on the committee to hold a televised meeting on Thursday to examine allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office interfered in the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering giant accused of bribery. It also requests that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould appear before committee ""no later than Wednesday, March. 27.""

The mandate of the ethics committee is to study matters related to multiple watchdog positions, including the commissioners of lobbying, privacy and ethics. Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion's office is currently conducting its own investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue, although the commissioner himself is currently on a ""prolonged"" medical leave.

In the letter, Kent and Gourdes argued that the allegations of political interference fall under the ethics committee's mandate to ""investigate matters as they pertain to ethics.""

The next ethics committee meeting is scheduled for Thursday, but the members are only slated to discuss the privacy of digital government services. The Conservatives said in a press release that they intend to move a motion to request Wilson-Raybould's appearance.

Speaking in the House of Commons ahead of question period, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer - who chairs the ethics committee - said the motion is in order. That means the committee, which has a Liberal majority, is going to be given the opportunity to vote on the motion.

“As always, members are welcome to submit witnesses. Any members of the public who may have information of wrongdoing that may help with an investigation can come forward and submit it to the ethics committee without fear,” Zimmer said.

The letter comes as the latest Conservative move to push for Wilson-Raybould to provide more testimony on the SNC-Lavalin issue following the parliamentary justice committee's Tuesday decision to end its own study on the issue. At the time, the Liberals argued the committee had obtained all the necessary information for Canadians to arrive at a conclusion on this issue.

""As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,"" Liberal MPs wrote in a letter addressed to the justice committee chair on Monday. ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all the rules and laws were followed.""

Should this latest motion fail, Conservative have vowed continued action to keep the allegations on the agenda.

""We will use every tool at our disposal to hold Justin Trudeau to account. Nothing is off the table and we are prepared for anything,"" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Tuesday.

One option in the Tory toolkit is their ability to launch a marathon voting session, which they are likely to do Wednesday evening with over 200 fiscal votes on notice.

Following the news that the justice committee ended its investigation into SNC-Lavalin, Scheer blasted the government for what he called an ""attack on the rule of law and our parliamentary democracy.""

""We will not sit idly by and allow that to happen,"" he said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, has been pushing on the Conservatives to shift their focus from SNC-Lavalin to the recently released budget.

""It's disappointing that the Conservatives actually don't care and don't know what's in the actual budget,"" Trudeau said during a speech in the House of Commons Tuesday.

Trudeau also emphasized Liberal party unity as he walked into a caucus meeting Wednesday morning. The meeting was the first since former president of the treasury board Jane Philpott resigned from cabinet, a move Wilson-Raybould had undertaken just weeks before.

""They’ve both indicated that they continue to believe in the Liberal Party and want to stand for us in the election in the fall,"" Trudeau said of Philpott and Wilson-Raybould. ""I look forward to continuing to work together.""

In an interview with Maclean's magazine that landed like a bomb Thursday on Parliament Hill, the ex-minister said she had concerns in January, before the controversy became public, but that she has been prevented from discussing them through efforts by the Prime Minister's Office to ""shut down the story.""

article continues below

Philpott joined the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, in resigning from Justin Trudeau's cabinet last month, following public allegations that the prime minister and others pressured Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering firm for alleged corrupt practices in Libya.

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,"" Philpott told Maclean's in her first extended interview since her resignation.

""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.""

Philpott's new public statements are already fanning the flames of a scandal the government is desperate to douse, and which the Opposition Conservatives are doing their best to keep alive. They've forced the House of Commons to sit all night, voting line by line on the Liberal government's spending plans.

On Wednesday, the Liberal majority in the House shot down a Conservative motion calling on Trudeau to let Wilson-Raybould testify more fully about what she experienced through the fall and into the early winter, especially what prompted her to resign from cabinet altogether after she was shuffled from the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in January.

The motion was defeated by a vote of 161-134, with both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould absent.

That set the stage for the Conservative-sponsored filibuster that began Wednesday night and continued through Thursday morning.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force to avoid potential defeat of the government. The voting could theoretically last 36 hours, but the Conservatives had only to keep it going until just after 10 a.m. ET today to scrub the remainder of the parliamentary day but the votes continued into the afternoon.

Committee meetings scheduled for Thursday have already been cancelled.

Philpott's interview gave new life to opposition MPs as the voting dragged on.

Nevertheless, Trudeau continued to say that Philpott and Wilson-Raybould are welcome to remain in the Liberal caucus, despite their criticisms of him just seven months before an election. While they disagree over the SNC-Lavalin matter, Trudeau said all Liberals are united on the ""big things"" like investing in the middle class, fighting climate change and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

After an announcement in Mississauga, pumping up the latest budget's promise to send $2.2 billion extra to municipal infrastructure projects, Trudeau noted that cabinet already waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak. That covered the alleged pressure she came under last fall, up to Jan. 14 when she was moved out of her dual role as justice minister and attorney general. He dismissed opposition calls to extend the waiver to apply to the period between Jan. 14 and Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet a month later.

""It was extremely important that the former attorney general be allowed to share completely her perspectives, her experiences on this issue, and that is what she was able to do,"" he said. ""The issue at question is the issue of pressure around the Lavalin issue while she was attorney general and she got to speak fully to that.""

Among the things Philpott told Maclean's she would like to speak out about is why she raised the SNC-Lavalin issue with Trudeau when he informed her he was shuffling her to Treasury Board and planning to move Wilson-Raybould into Philpott's former post at Indigenous Services.

Trudeau gave his version of that conversation, which echoed the testimony of his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, at the House of Commons justice committee.

""She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her no, it was not,"" Trudeau said. ""She then mentioned it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give, in explaining to Jody Wilson-Raybould how exciting this job was and what a great thing it would be for her to have that role.""

In an interview with Maclean’s magazine that has been making waves on Parliament Hill since it was published early Thursday, Philpott said that there is “much more to the story that needs to be told.”

Philpott, who resigned from cabinet earlier this month citing a loss of confidence in the way the government is handling the scandal, said in the interview that she believes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his top staff have been trying to “shut down” the story.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story. I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” Philpott said.

The Conservatives launched the overnight series of confidence votes on budgetary measures as their latest procedural display of outrage over what they consider a prolonged “cover up” of the controversy. At the heart of the affair: allegations from former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould of attempted political interference in the criminal prosecution of the Quebec engineering giant.

Facing questions about this latest development during a budget photo-op in the GTA, Trudeau—who like his fellow leaders was in and out of the House overnight—dismissed Philpott’s assertion that more needs to be aired. Trudeau said there has already been a “fullesome” accounting of the scandal, with more work to be done by the federal ethics commissioner’s office that is probing the matter.

He also maintained that so long as both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould want to be in the Liberal caucus, they are welcome, even though during a meeting of the Ontario MPs in the Liberal caucus on Wednesday, members of the caucus expressed displeasure with Philpott.

Wilson-Raybould delivered a four-hour testimony on Feb. 27, after Trudeau waived solicitor-client privileges and cabinet confidences so that she and anyone who participated in discussions with her could “address relevant matters.” Wilson-Raybould has said this waiver still limited her, something former top Trudeau adviser Gerald Butts disputed when he testified.

The 257 fiscal motions MPs are working their way through could take up to 40 hours to get through, meaning the filibuster could stretch into Friday.

As of 1 p.m. on Thursday, MPs have been voting continuously for 19 hours, and have made it through a little over half of the 257 votes the Tories are forcing. This filibuster-type tactic was triggered after the Liberal majority shut down the latest in what has been a series of attempts over the several weeks to have Prime Minister Justin Trudeau take further steps to allow Wilson-Raybould speak further and in more detail about the scandal.

Particularly the opposition have been keen to hear more about the series of events that unfolded after Wilson-Raybould was shuffled into veterans affairs. Wilson-Raybould left that portfolio in the early days of this scandal, and there’s since been two federal cabinet shuffles to readjust Trudeau’s front bench following her and Philpott’s high-profile departures.

Neither Wilson-Raybould nor Philpott were present for this vote, nor have they been seen in the Commons during the ongoing marathon session of confidence votes.

Throughout the marathon, Conservatives have been voting against every line item, which Liberals have been using to try to score political points on social media, pointing out some of the government programs and services the Tories are opposing. Though, from the Conservative’s perspective, their “no” votes are to signal they do not have confidence in the government.

There will be no normal House proceedings on Thursday as a result of the ongoing votes, meaning no question period, and no committee meetings.

In anticipation of the late-night sitting, cots were set up on the government side just outside the House of Commons chamber.

Armed with the new article, opposition MPs have periodically rose on various points of order to reference Philpott’s latest comments and try to poke at the Liberals to see if there’s any movement on agreeing to re-open aspects of the affair. So far all of these attempts have been rejected by the Liberals.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

OTTAWA -- The federal ...","OTTAWA -- The federal Conservatives have launched a marathon voting session in the House of Commons Wednesday evening, the latest procedural move being made over what they say is a Liberal ""cover up"" of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

The more than 200 fiscal votes the Conservatives had put on notice have started to be called, and if all go ahead it could be into Thursday before they’re done. For now, it’s shaping up to at least be an all-nighter of continuous voting.

The marathon session was triggered after the Liberals voted against a Conservative opposition day motion that called on the government to have the House ""take note"" of the comments from Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin affair, specifically the events that led to her resignation, which she said she was not able to speak to during her Feb. 27 House Justice Committee appearance.

The motion also called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive full solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences ""to allow the member for Vancouver Granville to address events that occurred following January 14, 2019, including her time as the Minister of Veterans Affairs, her resignation from that position, and her presentation to Cabinet that followed.""

The Liberals defeated the motion Wednesday night, as they have done on several other similar motions that either the opposition Conservatives or New Democrats have presented over the several weeks that the scandal has continued to take centre stage on Parliament Hill.

Shortly after the vote on the motion, watchers were offered a taste of some of the silliness that can set in during these long voting stretches. A Conservative MP rose to accuse Trudeau of ""hiding a bagel in his desk"" -- food is not allowed in the chamber. Trudeau rose to apologize and clarify that ""it was a chocolate bar.""

In anticipation of the late-night sitting, cots have been set up just outside the House of Commons chamber. Opposition MPs on Twitter said that the beds were set up by the government.

Asked if they ordered the beds, Liberal Whip Mark Holland told reporters that the government was ""making every accommodation to ensure that if we have 36 hours of voting that people are taken care of.""

As the person in charge of making sure the Liberals have enough people in the House at all times to win each confidence vote, he said ""every single item that comes forward represents an important priority for Canadians. Obviously, we’re going to be there.""

Hours later in the House once the voting began, Holland rose on a point of order to try to see if the other side would be amenable to pausing the votes between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. citing the impact on MPs' health. This attempt was unsuccessful.

These 257 fiscal motions -- considered confidence votes because they all have to do with budgetary measures -- could take up to 40 hours to get through if all are called, especially if a ""recorded vote"" is called on each. This would mean each person stands and is counted one by one, instead of a voice vote based on whether there are more MPs who say ""yay"" or ""nay.""

Of note this would be a chance for any disaffected Liberal MPs to formally register if they had lost confidence in team Trudeau. About an hour in to the voting, that had yet to occur, with even newly-departed and now Independent MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes voting along the government line on the various lines of spending.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer addressed his caucus Wednesday morning, where he once again restated his vow to do all in his power to get answers on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""I believe that Canadians place a higher value on the rule of law than Justin Trudeau gives them credit for,"" Scheer said.

Asked about the ongoing affair and continued calls for him to be more open, while at a housing photo-op Wednesday afternoon, Trudeau said the government took ""unprecedented"" steps to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak about what she experienced and she was afforded that opportunity.

""Unfortunately the Conservatives are now trying to make it about many more things…People can be assured that there was a full airing of everything associated with the issue at hand and we now continue to move forward on responding to the other concerns that people have,"" Trudeau said.

The Tories first floated the prospect of the marathon voting session over the weekend as their opposition motion day was first slated for Monday. This was swiftly shut down by the Liberals, who rescheduled it to Wednesday.

Responding to the prospect of voting into Thursday, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger said the Conservatives have been saying for the last three years that they'd be ""blocking"" the Liberal agenda.

“We had seen that this was coming,” she said.

Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen said Wednesday Bergen said that “we’re not going to let them just kind of go about their business here… nothing to see with the scandal. That’s not what we’re going to allow to happen. We’re going to use every mechanism available to stop that.”

The Conservatives are also looking to take the SNC-Lavalin fight to a second House committee.

Wednesday morning Conservative MPs on the House Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Committee sent a letter to the chair, who is a Conservative, asking for a televised meeting on Thursday.

The Conservatives argue that the allegations of political interference fall under the ethics committee’s mandate to ""investigate matters as they pertain to ethics.""

Marathon votes follow budget debacle

This comes after a raucous budget day in the House of Commons where the Conservatives delayed Finance Minister Bill Morneau reading his budget speech. This was out of outrage over Liberal MPs shutting down the House Justice Committee probe into the SNC-Lavalin affair without allowing Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify again. The initial plan was to delay the budget altogether but the Liberals usurped that when Morneau, minutes before 4 p.m., took many by surprise and tabled the document early.

Once he was able to launch into his speech, Morneau was soon drowned out by the opposition, who were banging on their desks, preventing Morneau from being heard for much of his delivery.

Twenty minutes into the speech, Scheer rose on a point of order and decried the Liberals tactics as ""an assault on democracy."" Conservative MPs rose from their seats and walked out of the House, and Morneau continued. It took him 50 minutes to complete his speech, concluding just before 6 p.m.

Scheer vowed to continue to use any tools they can to continue to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair at the top of the House agenda, and said they are ""prepared for anything.""

Reacting to the display, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was ""disappointing"" that the Conservatives didn't care about what was in the budget, and accused them of playing politics instead.

This is not the first time the Conservatives have forced hours of voting.

In March 2018, initially also pledged to be ""about 40 hours"" of votes, the Conservative led what ended up being a 21-hour procedural standoff over the India trip affair. Then in June they went for about 12 hours of votes over the government not releasing a breakdown of how much its carbon pricing will cost Canadians.

Number of bills left to pass

There are just 47 scheduled sitting days left in the House of Commons, and with the prospect of these votes and future procedural delay tactics being used, the amount of time left for the Liberals to pass bills and hold debates on key agenda items for them is diminishing, with continued opposition pushback.

The government has been signalling a desire to change the channel as it is keen to fulfill as many promises as possible before Trudeau seeks the governor general's approval to dissolve Parliament and issue the writ for the fall election campaign.

The Liberals want to pass 22 government bills they consider ""active."" Of these, 10 are still in the House while 12 have made it into the Senate.

In the just over 20 sitting days so far this year, just two government bills have fully passed, while three new pieces of legislation have been introduced.

There's at least one more new bill coming soon: the bill to implement measures in the 2019 budget. In all three federal budgets of this government, that has been spread over two separate bills in each year, often hundreds of pages each.

In a March 18 interview with CTVNews.ca, Chagger said that given the current tone and tenor in the House and the long list of legislation to be passed, she'll be looking to use tools like time allocation to try to push bills through.

""Of course I will. We know that the legislation we are advancing is actually working… The opposition is having a very hard time with that because at the end of the day they are more committed to their political benefits and their partisan games rather than the success of Canadians,"" Chagger said.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “thumbing his nose” at Canadians, and said the official Opposition would use “every tool available to us” to hold the government accountable in Parliament.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is slated to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

Scheer called the government’s budget “a political prop” in its “unprecedented cover-up” of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau’s top adviser and the country’s most senior public servant to resign.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs unsuccessfully pressed the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould so she could shed more light on the simmering controversy.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin finds itself at the centre of a national political storm over allegations prime ministerial aides crossed a line in leaning on Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair.

“What happened today is absolutely outrageous,” said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

“If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister’s misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.”

Liberals on the justice committee wrote to the chairman, fellow Liberal Anthony Housefather, this week to say the committee had done its job and should move on to other business.

“As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,” says the letter. “Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed. Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

Liberal committee member Randy Boissonault reiterated the contents of the letter following the meeting, saying Tuesday’s session was the 10th in five weeks, amounting to 13 hours of testimony given by 10 witnesses.

“We have heard from many of the key players in this matter,” he said.

The Liberal members tabled a motion Tuesday calling for the committee to begin a study of the rise of hate crimes in Canada.

They say the federal ethics commissioner, who has launched a probe of the SNC-Lavalin matter, is best suited to investigate the political controversy.

They also note former justice minister Anne McLellan has been appointed to explore the relationship between the government and the minister of justice, who plays a second role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

But the opposition would have none of it.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said the committee should hold town-hall meetings on SNC-Lavalin and hear from Canadians about the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has a right to reply to other witnesses including Gerald Butts, the former top adviser to Trudeau, Raitt said in objecting to the Liberal effort to move on.

“They’re controlling what is being said, they’re controlling who is being heard from, they’re controlling whether or not we study a topic. This is really egregious and absolutely shameful.”

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin called it “yet another effort to change the channel” by the government.

SNC-Lavalin faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya. The company unsuccessfully pressed the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a “remediation agreement,” a legal means of holding an organization to account for wrongdoing without a formal finding of guilt.

The director told SNC-Lavalin in October that negotiating a remediation agreement would be inappropriate in this particular case.

Wilson-Raybould has told the justice committee she was relentlessly pressured to ensure the Montreal engineering giant was invited to negotiate an agreement. She was shuffled from the justice portfolio in January, becoming veterans affairs minister.

Trudeau has denied that any undue pressure was placed on Wilson-Raybould.

She has testified at the justice committee for nearly four hours, but has indicated there is more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Butts, once considered Trudeau’s right-hand man, quit his job as principal secretary, saying he did not want to be a distraction from the government’s agenda. In addition, Jane Philpott left cabinet over the government’s handling of the controversy.

The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country’s top public servant, having concluded he’s lost the trust of opposition parties.

In an interview with Maclean’s magazine that landed like a bombshell Thursday on Parliament Hill, the ex-minister says she had concerns before the controversy became public in January, but that she has been prevented from discussing them, alleging efforts by the Prime Minister’s Office to “shut down the story.”

Philpott joined the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, in resigning from Justin Trudeau’s cabinet last month, following public allegations that Trudeau and others pressured Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering firm for alleged corrupt practices in Libya.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,” Philpott told Maclean’s in her first extended interview since her resignation.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

Philpott’s new public statements are already fanning the flames of a scandal the government is desperate to douse, and which the Opposition Conservatives are doing their best to keep alive. They’ve forced the House of Commons to sit all night, voting line by line on the Liberal government’s spending plans.

The Liberal majority in the House shot down a Conservative motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to let Wilson-Raybould testify more fully about what she experienced through the fall and into the early winter, especially what prompted her to resign from cabinet altogether after she was shuffled from the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in January.

The motion was defeated by a vote of 161-134, with both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould absent.

That set the stage for the Conservative-sponsored filibuster that began Wednesday night and continued through Thursday morning.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force to avoid potential defeat of the government. The voting could theoretically last 36 hours, but the Conservatives have only to keep it going until just after 10 a.m. today to scrub the remainder of the parliamentary day.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Neil Bruce said March 20 if the engineering firm is convicted and barred from bidding on federal contracts here at home its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company’s foreign rivals.

“There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They’ll get a job,” Bruce said.

“This thing that somehow they’re going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.”

Bruce’s comments come as a political storm in Ottawa continues over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to end a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau and his staff have said their only concern was for SNC-Lavalin’s 9,000 jobs, which might be at risk if the company were convicted and then barred from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and the country’s top public servant, although he continues to insist no one did anything wrong.

Bruce said its Canadian workforce has decreased from 20,000 in 2012 and will likely fall further. That, despite it being the only Canadian company that does nuclear technology work helping Ontario facilities like Chalk River, Darlington and Pickering. Also, no other domestic firm does the scope of infrastructure services on projects in cities like Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.

He said the company has calculated that about 75% of its rivals have concluded deferred prosecution agreements (DPA) in their host countries and are free to work in Canada.

Meanwhile, Bruce said he still doesn’t know why the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould were not open to granting a remediation agreement.

He said the company appealed that decision in Federal Court, hoping to learn some of the rationale.

“We did an appeal not because we thought we would win the appeal but because we thought we might get a reason and that got tossed out with no reason so we still don’t know.”

Bruce said he’s not holding much hope that an agreement will be offered under the current political climate, especially if the Conservatives win the fall election, and is preparing for a lengthy legal process.

“We have never asked for the charges to be dropped, we’ve never asked for anything to be circumvented,” he said. “We just want to move on for the sake principally of our employees first and foremost and our investors.”

A main stumbling block to getting a DPA could be public perception that former employees accused of crimes aren’t being held accountable, he said.

He said innocent SNC-Lavalin employees feel bruised and battered by the last six weeks since a report surfaced that government officials pressured the former attorney general to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

“And I think fundamentally that’s unfair on our employees who had nothing to do with what went on seven to 20 years ago.”

While he’s not surprised that politicians would make hay out of this issue during an election year, Bruce said he’s concerned the company will continue to be a political punching bag as the campaign unfolds.

“If it sort of doesn’t move on from that or gets worse of course it’s a concern.”

Bruce also said few people have publicly defended the company’s important contribution to the country as a home-grown success story.

“So if anybody’s happy for us not being able to do that work and give it to the Americans or give it to the Europeans I think that’s a sad, sad position.”

He said there’s no plans to move the company’s headquarters from Montreal, adding competitors are envious of its shareholder base that is 82% Canadian and led by the Caisse de depot which has helped fund its acquisition of British engineering firm Atkins.

432,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"VANCOUVER—As another scandal plays out in Ottawa, government watchdog groups are calling for wider scrutiny of SNC-Lavalin's activities in jurisdictions like British Columbia, where the company donated to the ruling political party at the same time it ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

– United States unemployment levels fell more than expected last week, according to reports.
