0,Empty,2019-02-23T11:00:00Z,The country offers a cautionary tale about democracy and voting rights.,"Some of the evacuees expressed anger at the discomforts of the trip: long queues at the Beirut waterfront; crowded ships that lacked air-conditioning. A Toronto TV station quoted one man: “It’s a humiliation. Is this because we are of Arab origin? The government said ‘trust us’ and this is the trust I put in them?” It soon became public knowledge—although this, too, was never officially confirmed—that nearly half of the evacuees returned home to Lebanon within the month.

Comments like that did not sit well with many people back in Canada. Some politicians and commentators began to speak of “Canadians of convenience”: people who lived permanently abroad, did not pay Canadian taxes, and remembered their Canadian citizenship only when they needed rescue.

As a partial step to addressing these complaints, the government took steps to tighten rules about expatriate citizenship. It began for the first time to seriously enforce the ban on voting by long-term expatriates, people who had lived outside Canada for five years or longer. As Canada headed into a federal election in 2011 under the new rules, two expatriate Canadians filed a lawsuit to demand restoration of their voting rights. That litigation wended its way through the judicial system. In January 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced an answer: All Canadian citizens may vote in Canadian elections, no matter how long they have lived outside the country. The text of the decision would seem to apply even to those Canadian citizens who have never lived in Canada at all, or who have acquired nationality in another country.

Even before the decision, the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau had moved ahead with legislation. I number among those supposedly benefited by the new legislation. In November 2018, I testified to the Canadian Senate against it.

My advice went unheeded, obviously. Yet it’s still worth thinking together: How is democracy supposed to work in a world of dissolving national boundaries and proliferating dual, triple, and quadruple citizenships?

Perhaps you think of Canada as an immigration magnet, but Canada also exports people in large numbers: perhaps 2.8 million people, or about 9 percent of the country’s population. (In contrast, only about 9 million nonmilitary Americans live abroad, or less than 3 percent of the U.S. population.)

Naturalized Canadians are three times as likely to live outside Canada as native-born Canadians, according to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. About 24 percent of immigrants from Hong Kong return to the territory after acquiring Canadian citizenship, as do 30 percent of immigrants from Taiwan.

You can see the appeal. Hong Kong’s economy is growing much faster than Canada’s. Its income-tax rates top out at 17 percent. Canada does not tax the foreign-source income of nonresident citizens, in effect creating a geopolitical arbitrage opportunity too attractive to miss: the protections of Canadian nationality at low Hong Kong prices.",What Does It Mean to Be a Canadian Citizen?,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/should-expats-always-be-able-vote-home-country/583318/

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan parliament leader who many countries now recognize as the country’s interim president, has worked with the U.S. government to bring millions of dollars worth of aid to the country, where a humanitarian crisis has driven millions to the edge of starvation and forced more than 3 million people – one tenth of the population – to flee. Trucks and warehouses filled with food, medicine and other supplies now sit at several locations just outside the country – in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, at points along the southern border with Brazil and on the nearby island of Curaçao.

But Maduro, who has refused to abandon the presidency and retains the support of Venezuela’s powerful military, is refusing to let the aid in. He says it is an attempt “to humiliate the Venezuelan people” and has labelled the food “carcinogenic.” On Wednesday he banned all travel to Curaçao and on Thursday closed the border with Brazil. There, soldiers opened fire on civilians who tried to reopen it to get the aid in, killing two indigenous people.

Despite all that, Guaidó has promised the aid will get into Venezuela “one way or another” by Saturday. As aid amasses on the border and Maduro’s military prepares to face-off with Guaidó supporters, here’s what to know about the stand-off:

Why do Venezuelans need humanitarian aid?

Venezuela’s current crisis dates back to its Socialist Revolution in 1998, led by Maduro’s predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez, who was elected on a platform of eliminating poverty. For years he used Venezuela’s vast oil wealth (the country has the largest proven reserves in the world) to fund expansive social programs, such as subsidized utilities and free health care and education.

But both Chávez and Maduro also presided over widespread corruption and economic mismanagement. The government structured Venezuela’s economy to focus on oil revenues and importing food in order to benefit the military and political elite, which controls both sectors, says Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela expert at risk analysts IHS Markit.

“They started to generate a crisis, where the country was producing less and less,” he says, adding that the country produces only around 20% of the food it needs. “These shortages have been common in Venezuela for many years now.”

Things got dramatically worse in 2014, when a drop in global oil prices meant the government had less cash to import food. At the same time, falling investor confidence in the country sent the value of Venezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, into free fall. Since then acute shortages of food and other imported goods have lead to widespread hunger, with the average Venezuelan losing 24 pounds in 2017. The lack of basic medicine has crippled the health system. People with chronic illnesses can’t access treatment, and diseases like measles and malaria, previously wiped out, have surged.

Determined to maintain his grip on power, Maduro has grown increasingly authoritarian, sidelining the opposition-held parliament, replacing judges on the supreme court, repressing protests with violence, and imprisoning political opponents.

Who is trying to bring aid into Venezuela?

Guaidó, the 35 year-old leader of an opposition party, claims that Maduro won his second term in May 2018 in rigged elections. Because of this, Guaidó says, the constitution mandates that he, as the head of parliament, take charge to call new elections.

The U.S., along with most other Western democracies, quickly recognized Guaidó as interim president after his inauguration ceremony on Jan. 23 and the Trump Administration has vowed to help him take power. They also answered his call for humanitarian assistance, with National Security Adviser John Bolton pledging $20 million of aid. Canada, Germany and others have also contributed.

Colombia, which has dealt with an influx of over a million desperate Venezuelan refugees, is helping to coordinate efforts to get the aid in. Meanwhile, British billionaire Richard Branson has helped to organize a massive pop concert at the Tienditas bridge near Cúcuta on Friday and Saturday, featuring some of Latin America’s most famous acts, to raise money for more supplies. Maduro has organized his own rival concert on the other side of the border.

U.N. agencies, along with the Red Cross and Catholic charity Cáritas, have refused to help bring aid in, saying that it is too political a move for neutral aid groups to join in. “The action of the Red Cross is based on two principles: humanity and neutrality. Neutrality is the most important one in situations like this,” Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told CNN.

Will the aid get in?

Though Guaidó has pledged to get the supplies into Venezuela by Saturday, it is far from clear that he will be able to do so, because the military is enforcing Maduro’s blockade.

The military used oil tankards to close off the main road bridge to Cúcuta in Colombia. On Thursday night, the Venezuelan national guard blocked the path of a convoy of buses transporting opposition members of parliament participating in the aid efforts. Many fear the next few days will see more violent clashes between the armed forces and Guaidó supporters, like the one at the Brazilian border.

The military’s continued support for the regime in the face of the humanitarian and political crisis can be explained by the comfortable life top generals have enjoyed under him. The regime has given the military control over imports, oil and other industries, and also allowed them to take part in a widespread corruption and organized crime.

“Corruption has corroded the entire institution, all along chain of command, and the counterintelligence agency has kept track of who is involved in what,” Raul Gallegos, a political analyst based in Bogotá, told TIME last month. “We cannot readily expect the security forces to respond the way any other institution would under similar pressure.”

Will the aid help topple Maduro?

Whatever happens, though, the stand-off will undermine Maduro’s grip on power, Moya-Ocampos says. “If he manages to block the aid, it will be clear he is out of touch with the population’s need,” he says. “If it enters, it will show he no longer controls the security apparatus – either way he looks weaker and weaker.”

The international community is hoping that the spectacle of badly-needed aid piled up on the border will prompt the lower ranks of the military to rebel against the high command, either by allowing the supplies in, or even by abandoning their support for Maduro entirely.

Moya-Ocampos says the showdown over aid will be the start, not the end, of fundamental change in Venezuela. “It might not happen immediately, but this episode is going to start off a process of division inside the armed forces, which I do think is irreversible.”

5,Empty,2019-02-23T06:00:00Z,The B'nai Brith and the Conservative Party resort to�gutter tactics in an attempt to stifle Canada's populist alternative.�,"Recently, with major elections soon taking place, the B'nai Brith of Canada, the sister organization of American ""hate-watch"" group the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), launched a defamatory broadside against the People's Party of Canada (PPC), that nation's brand-new populist alternative to the more establishment-friendly Conservative Party of Canada.

Instead of yielding to pressure, Masse and the PPC fired back, claiming that the attack was completely meritless and that the Conservatives were actually likely involved. In a tough election year against Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and with outspoken PPC founder Maxime ""Mad Max"" Bernier increasingly scoring points against (as he calls them) the ""intellectually corrupt"" Conservatives, even in Canada's otherwise ultra-polite political arena, the Conservatives' involvement looks highly believable.

Although covered by most of Canada's institutional media, the basis for the B'nai Brith's attack was remarkably thin. In their press release, the group quoted lines from blog posts that were not only over a decade old (having appeared on a French-Canadian blog in 2002), but, according to Masse, highly exaggerated and clearly out of context.

For instance, the B'nai Brith accused Masse of ""racism"" and ""having Nazi sympathies"" for stating at the time that the media's labeling of Austria's Freedom Party as a ""group of Nazis"" was overblown — that party is now part of Austria's coalition government. But as Masse had to point out later in his own press release, the B'nai Brith apparently ""missed"" the part in his post where he quoted Simon Wiesenthal saying the exact same thing.

Elsewhere, they accused Masse of anti-Semitism for raising concerns about Israel's policies toward Zionism and its treatment of its Palestinian minority (these were the heady days of the Second Intifada), to which Masse later responded that he most certainly hadn't intend to attack Jewish people as a whole and that, in any case, his general views on Israel had since become more ""nuanced."" Had the B'nai Brith reached out to Masse first to see if his views had indeed since changed, they may have held back. They may have also discovered that Masse is homosexual and accordingly tempered their claims that he is homophobic.

(For a full account of the ""offending"" quotations and their context, find the B'nai Brith's and Masse's press releases.)

But groups like the B'nai Brith never do this. When it comes to individuals or organizations they disagree with, it's shoot first, debate never. Like the ADL or the Southern Poverty Law Center, the B'nai Brith's business model depends on finding ""hate"" wherever it can so as to ensure that donations remain high and steady. This should give major media sources serious pause before they report on their investigations or turn to them for ""expert opinion.""

The B'nai Brith's more direct motivation for the smear campaign was likely related to its CEO, Michael Mostyn, who is closely connected with the Conservative Party. Mostyn ran as a candidate twice for the party in recent federal elections (he lost both times). This was a fact raised in Masse's response but, unfortunately, not in the media's coverage. The media did note that the Conservatives suspiciously had an official condemnation of the PPC ready to go ""less than an hour"" after the B'nai Brith put out its press release. Speculating about the ""political motivations"" behind the attack, when asked about the accusations by reporters, Bernier told them that ""[m]aybe they want to do that because they're supporting another party ... by doing that, they are not doing a favor to their organization.""

This, and the general timing of the attack — again, just two weeks before several key byelections, which kick off the full election year — seems to raise far more questions about the Conservative Party than it does about Masse.

Again, the Conservatives' motivation behind their coordination with Mostyn's B'nai Brith seems clear. If the PPC show strong results in the upcoming byelections (followed by the general election later this year), they'll be taking votes away from the Conservative Party, pressuring them to change their ""Liberal Party-lite"" platform, as some call it. This is something most Conservatives are apparently loath to do. Just as our own conservative establishment before President Trump came to power, the Conservative Party has long tried to keep issues that working-class conservatives care about, like immigration, off the party's platform. Even with property values hitting crisis levels in Canada's heavily immigrant major cities — Nearly 90 percent of Canada's immigrants go to just Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal — Conservatives have not proposed a migration reduction. The PPC, on the other hand, have.

Whether the PPC can persevere through these attacks and establish themselves as a serious conservative alternative, we'll see with the upcoming elections. This latest challenge has certainly proved their leadership's mettle. Unlike what's expected of most conservatives when hit with these sorts of allegations, Masse and Bernier did not back down, and instead castigated the B'nai Brith and the Conservative Party for their gutter tactics and apparent underhanded coordination.

6,Empty,2019-02-24T19:50:32Z,Another subtle move from a Florida man.,"Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio shared these images with his 3.7 million Twitter followers on Sunday (Feb. 24):

The pair of photos show Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi, before and after a US-backed NATO coalition ejected him from power with an air bombing campaign in 2011. That year, he was captured by a rival militia in Libya’s ongoing civil war, tortured, and executed in the streets.

Why is Rubio sharing these images? To threaten Venezuela’s embattled leader, Nicolas Maduro, who was returned to power after elections last year that were called unfair by numerous international bodies, including the European Union, Freedom House and Amnesty International.”

The collapse of Venezuela’s socialist economy and political system—which began after the death of president Hugo Chavez in 2013—is now a full-scale humanitarian crisis. Following large protests against Nicolás Maduro’s government, an elected opposition leader, Juan Guaido, declared himself interim president and was recognized by other Latin American countries, the US, Canada, and eleven European states.

Maduro, however, isn’t going quietly, and his decision to block food, medicine, and other necessaries from reaching people in his country has abetted political chaos. On Saturday (Feb. 23), pro-Maduro security forces set fire to a convoy of aid trucks attempting to cross into the country from Columbia, killing at least four people.

Rubio, whose politics are driven in part by his family’s experience of the socialist revolution in Cuba, has been a vocal supporter of US military action to oust Maduro and relieve the humanitarian crisis. Earlier on Sunday, he shared a less-graphic pair of photos featuring former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, a US-backed strongman who lost the backing of Washington and was eventually ousted during a US invasion in 1989.

Experts question the wisdom of using US military action to break Maduro’s embargo and allow humanitarian aid, much less to affect regime change. Maduro has already used existing US sanctions to rally his supporters, and a foreign invasion could have a similar effect. A former US Air Force general says that military force is not the right choice. Venezuela is comparable in size to Iraq or Afghanistan, and could require a commensurate commitment of US resources.

7,Empty,2019-02-25T12:00:00Z,The nation’s eyes are on B.C. for Monday’s byelections across Canada,"Ballots will be cast in Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Quebec’s Outremont ridings, but no race is being watched more closely than the one in Burnaby South, B.C., where New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh is vying for his first seat in Parliament.

BURNABY, B.C.—A trio of federal byelections on Monday will offer more than just an early glimpse of voters’ dispositions, potentially shaking up the political landscape months before Canadians head to the polls en masse.

“There’s already rumblings that if he loses, it will be difficult for him to stay on as leader — and (it) would probably further undermine the NDP’s electoral prospects going into the federal election after an already underwhelming year.”

“Singh needs to win to consolidate his power as the leader of the party,” explained political scientist David Moscrop, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

8,Empty,2019-02-23T23:10:32Z,"As tech giants grow ever more powerful, Canada and others are under pressure to act TheSpec.com As tech companies grow ever more powerful, countries such as Canada must decide how to protect the public without turning away economic benefits.","Practically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google's Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.

She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.

""They have created a state of surveillance,"" she says.

Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments, fearing potential human rights abuses.

Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.

That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.

""The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,"" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.

""We are the product that they are selling.""

Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.

What others are doing:

In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 ""consent decree,"" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.

But the ""gold standard"" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.

The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.

Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.

What Canada is doing:

Canada is in ""a significantly weaker situation than the EU,"" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.

The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the ""fining powers"" of the EU law.

""There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,"" he says.

Levin says there's been an ""absolute lack of will,"" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.

In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the ""power to force Facebook to do anything,"" he says.

The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.

""They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,"" he says.

But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.

In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled ""Towards Privacy By Design,"" which she believes shows a ""clear intent"" to enhance the law.

Disinformation

The issue:

In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and ""fake news"" on social media — especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.

Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious ""disinformation."" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.

And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining ""fake news"" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.

Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. ""No one's figured it out,"" says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. ""We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.""

What others are doing:

Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of ""fake news"" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a €75,000 fine.

In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report — released this week following an 18-month investigation — is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.

Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act — sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or ""Facebook law"" — which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)

The penalty for breaking this law? Up to €50 million in fines. ""This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,"" Tworek says.

What Canada is doing:

""Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,"" says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.

He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by ""third party"" advocacy groups during campaign periods — meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.

Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).

In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect ""online deceptive practices"" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.

But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.

He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to ""quickly and efficiently"" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.

One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives — including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai — to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.

Taxation

The issue:

In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google — not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon — have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.

They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.

""There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,"" says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. ""Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.""

Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of ""permanent establishment,"" Wyonch explains — this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But ""our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,"" she says.

Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).

Meanwhile, domestic companies — which do have to collect and remit sales taxes — argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.

When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. ""That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,"" according to Wyonch.

There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. ""Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?"" Wyonch asks. ""We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would — and would not — be considered Canadian income.""

What others are doing:

The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries — like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand — are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.

What Canada is doing:

Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.

Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies — including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix — were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.

Jennifer Yang

Competition

The issue:

The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.

Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.

Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data — the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird & Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate — charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay — as a result of customer data they have obtained.

The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.

What others are doing:

The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.

Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the €2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.

Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.

Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s — or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance.

What Canada is doing:

Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, ""this is not in and of itself cause for concern,"" according to the Competition Bureau.

In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while ""big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.""

The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may ""soften competition"" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.

Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.

""For competition law enforcement in Canada,"" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, ""it's déjà vu for now.""

Michael Lewis

Addiction

The issue: This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.

There are however ""problematic behaviours"" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.

Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.

Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.

Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.

Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.

Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes ""hooking"" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a ""cornerstone"" of the tech business.

What others are doing:

Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.

France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals ""the right to disconnect.""

The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.

""I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,"" he says.

In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of ""immersive and addictive technologies"" in December 2018, looking into the ""addictive nature of some technologies,"" and how they can impact behaviour.

What Canada is doing:

""Not a whole lot has been done,"" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.

Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.

Copyright

The issue:

Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.

What others are doing:

Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.

A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.

In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.

In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.

Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the ""worst offender"" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.

What Canada is doing:

In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.

Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.

The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if ""fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.""

Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.

9,Empty,2019-02-24T09:00:00Z,"In the age of big tech scandals, data leaks and cyber-attacks, a diplomat from Denmark is grappling with global governments and tech titans to protect digital interests and preserve democracy.","""I think it was Obama's chief of staff that said never let a good crisis go to waste,"" says Casper Klynge, when asked about the past year of tech scandals.

Klynge was referring to former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's comments during the 2008 financial crisis. Fast-forward a decade, and the world is grappling with another crisis, fuelled by the creations of tech's biggest titans.

""The [Facebook] Cambridge Analytica case, some of the other data leaks — 500 million people have been involved in data leaks in the last 10 months alone,"" says Klynge, appointed by Denmark as the world's first tech ambassador.

WATCH: The National's interview with Casper Klynge, Sunday night on CBC Television and streamed online

""Now, that has been a blessing in disguise in the sense that it sort of makes it evident to most people that there are boundaries, and there are real issues at stake, and it is necessary for us to have a conversation with the companies. Also, to make sure that they [companies] assume a responsibility which is proportional to the kind of influence that they're exercising.""

When you consider that Facebook and Google have more combined users than half the global population, the influence they wield is monolithic, he says. The sheer size and scale of these companies has forced a power shift not seen since the Industrial Revolution.

Now, amid scandals surrounding personal data leaks and hacked elections, governments are scrambling to catch up.

Enter Klynge.

Denmark was ahead of the curve, dispatching Klynge to Silicon Valley 18 months ago with a lofty mandate: to protect Danish interests and democracy in the digital age.

A career diplomat who has served in Kosovo, Darfur and Helmand province, Klynge admits it wasn't the easiest of transitions.

Watch: Casper Klynge on why clout is needed to engage the tech titans

Danish tech ambassador Casper Klynge talks about his rough start in Silicon Valley. 0:40

So what exactly is Techplomacy?

While many traditional ambassadors focus their attention on economic issues, Klynge has a different mandate.

""I spend very little time on promoting investment opportunities or export opportunities for Danish companies,"" Klynge says. ""What we're really talking about is the big issues. How technology is potentially undermining democracy, election processes. How content, illegal content like terrorism or extremism, how that is a huge problem for all of us, all democratic countries.

And rather than being posted to a specific country, Klynge's responsibilities are global.

""My embassy is slightly different than all other embassies in the Danish foreign ministry, because it's almost a virtual embassy. Part of my team is in Silicon Valley, another part of it is in Copenhagen, and a third part is actually in Beijing. So we're also trying to treat this in a different way, we have a global mandate, it's not all about Silicon Valley.""

Klynge recently brought his vision for ""techplomacy"" to Ottawa, meeting with Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould to discuss how Canada plans to protect itself in the lead-up to the next federal election.

Watch: Casper Klynge says his mandate is to see that technology protects democracy

With upcoming elections in Denmark and Canada, Danish tech ambassador Casper Klynge says democracy needs to be protected at all costs. 0:40

Klynge hopes to persuade Canada to join an alliance of like-minded nations, and perhaps even create its own tech ambassador.

""To some extent that's almost part of my success criteria, that we do get a critical mass around the table. Because it goes without saying that as a small country with less than six million people, we [Denmark] will never be able to move the agenda, vis-a-vis the big technology companies,"" Klynge says.

""We need other countries around the table and we need more international collaboration, not less, in the digital age. And that again goes back to why this is a foreign policy initiative.""

When coders cross the line

Klynge is a proponent of creating a sort of Hippocratic Oath for people who write software, to ensure they adhere to code of ethics. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

Aside from protecting democracy, Klynge is pushing for the creation of an international code of ethics that all tech companies would need to adhere to.

He points to a recent airline scam in the U.K. as an example of just one way software engineers have crossed the line in the pursuit of corporate profit.

""Algorithms in some airlines were set up to make sure that families were basically split when they did the seat allocation, to make a little bit extra off having families pay to be seated together. And as a family member I've experienced that many times myself,"" Klynge says.

""But I think the interesting bit is that it also initiated a debate among coders, among programmers, to say who on Earth would actually write algorithms that disperses families across an airline? Is that really what coders should be involved in?

""So I think that resulted in sort of almost a Hippocratic Oath from coders — saying you work in a decent way, you write algorithms without biases — I think that's an important dimension of it as well.""

Can China be trusted?

Klynge says the world's government and corporate leaders are currently wrestling with rules and protections that could determine whether technology will ultimately be a force for good or be abused by those in power. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

Questions over ethics and trust are at the centre of much bigger debate — whether or not Chinese tech giant Huawei poses a threat to Canadian security.

Ottawa and Beijing have been locked in a diplomatic dispute since the December arrest of Meng Wanzhou. The Huawei executive was detained in Vancouver at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition on fraud allegations.

The Trudeau government is still deciding whether to ban Huawei from Canada's 5G networks.

Klynge says whether the debate is over 5G technology or artificial intelligence, China's influence cannot be ignored.

Watch: Casper Klynge says it's important to keep the conversation with China going

Amid tensions between Ottawa and Beijing over the possible ban of Chinese tech giant Huawei's gear from Canadian communications networks, Casper Klynge answers a question on the minds of many: Can China be trusted? 0:40

Whether the finger is being pointed at Beijing or Silicon Valley, Klynge says a much bigger battle is being waged.

""The big debate, or the big conflict if you like, is of course whether technology will be a doer of good. Whether it will promote democracies and freedom, whether it will empower people, bring better health care, better education, or whether technology could also be a means for increased control. And those authoritarian aspects of it — it goes without saying that China plays an important role here that we need to pay attention to.

""But that doesn't mean that we don't need a dialogue with China. And one of the reasons why part of my office is there [in Beijing] is, you know, we might not agree with everything, we might not see eye to eye on everything, but we need to have a conversation.""",Hacking the foreign-policy playbook: Tech-diplomat aims to protect democracy in digital age,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/national-casper-klyge-tech-ambassador-1.4828015

“I thought hard about what life was going to be like as a private citizen, and I think what I’ve always loved is policy — whether it’s foreign policy or domestic policy, I’ve always loved it, and I always want to have a voice,” Haley told the Washington Post.

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

""Even though I have entered private life, I will never stop standing up for America’s freedom and values,” Haley said. “We all have a part to play in keeping our country safe, strong, and prosperous.""

Burnaby South, which was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart, who is now Vancouver’s mayor, is an important race for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is vying for a seat in Parliament.

Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson are also running in Burnaby South.

Polls are open Monday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Lee is running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post. Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, is the first candidate seeking a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

Green party Leader Elizabeth May said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

It could be a close election to watch. The New Democrats beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in the 2015 election.

Byelections are also being held in the Ontario riding of York–Simcoe and the Quebec riding of Outremont.

""We have decided to turn to the International Criminal Court with a request to take into account the grave humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of [Venezuelan President] Nicolas Maduro's regime against civilians and the denial of access to international aid, which is a crime against humanity"", the statement said.

Participants at the Lima Group meeting also stressed that the transition to ""democracy"" must be performed by Venezuelans themselves without the use of force and in line with the country's constitution.

""We call on the countries that continue to maintain partnership relations with Nicolas Maduro's illegitimate regime, to help find solutions that would open the way to a democratic transition and the holding of free, fair, transparent and credible elections"", the statement added.

Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called on the international community to join the Lima Group on the situation in Venezuela.

""It is important to invite more and more members of the international community, those who will participate with us in the expanded dialogue, so that they will join the actions that are made by us as the Lima Group and will support Venezuelans’ efforts aimed at restoring democracy and hope"", the foreign minister said Monday.

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

13,Empty,2019-02-22T04:14:06Z,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned on Monday amid a growing scandal concerning the allegations that PMO tried to interfere with the potential criminal trial of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.,"Sputnik discussed this story with Rémi Tremblay, the editor of Le Harfang and a contributor to the Council of Euro-Canadian and the author of Le Canada français, de Jacques Cartier au génocide tranquille.

Sputnik: How seriously will the Trudeau scandal hurt his chances of victory in the next election? Do you think it is a coincidence that this scandal emerged just a few months before the election campaign will officially begin?

Rémi Tremblay: The timing could not be worst for the Liberals, with the elections being just around the corner. It is extremely hard to evaluate the impact on the vote, but ethics has always been the Achille's heel of the federal Liberals. One of the reasons that explain the Conservative victory of 2006 is the corruption scandal revealed by the Gomery commission of inquiry. It took ten years for the Liberals to finally regain Canadians' trust and this new scandal will certainly hurt them. The question is simply to what extent. To add to that, although the decision has nothing to do with politics, Stéphane Roy, a former SNC-Lavalin employee accused of being involved in the corruption scandal in Libya, has seen his charges dismissed this month because the judicial procedures were too long. For many Canadians, it gives the feeling that the men involved will be able to avoid facing justice for what they have done. It is hard to believe that the timing of the revelations is a coincidence, but we must keep in mind that it is the Globe and Mail that first unveiled this scandal to the public. The Globe can definitely not be labelled a Conservative newspaper. We can doubt that it was published to intentionally hurt Trudeau's campaign. In fact, Trudeau could have tried defusing the whole affair and ensured the story deflated quickly and be long forgotten by this fall's elections.

Rémi Tremblay: Butts, although he may not be well-known to the general public was Trudeau's policy maker, his mastermind as well as a close friend since McGill's years. In September 2015, Macleans ran an article about Butts, describing him as the man who ""has shaped and branded the vast majority of policy"" that Trudeau campaigned on. Since then, his influence has increased, not decreased and he was called ""PM Butts"" by some Liberal caucus members. Trudeau, who sees himself as a delegate, an ambassador, relied on Butts for actual policy-making and explained to his MPs that what Butts said could be considered to be Trudeau's own thoughts. Trudeau Senior had Gérard Pelletier, and Trudeau Junior had Gerald Butts.

Sputnik: Both other major parties (the Conservatives & NDP) have spoken out in support of a public inquiry into the Trudeau SNC-Lavalin scandal. Could this lead to new revelations?

Rémi Tremblay: The question that is still left unanswered is the personal involvement of Trudeau. The pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould and the fact that she was subsequently downgraded to the Veteran Affairs, even if she had been a much publicized caucus member, shows that the pressure came from the top of the government. The resignation of Butts gives the impression that he was the one who actually put pressure to avoid prosecutions for SNC-Lavalin, but he could very well be taking the shot for his personal friend Trudeau. Has tried taking the blame to save private Trudeau? It is the impression left by the move and it is what the Conservatives and Neo-Democrats would like to know.

Ian Hammond / Change.org 'Seems Pricey': Canadians LOL as Petition to Sell Montana to Canada Gains Steam

Rémi Tremblay: The way the whole affair was handled by the government does raise legitimate questions. It is now said that the decision for not suing the company was based on economically based reasons. With around 16 000 employees in Canada, its bankruptcy or major losses could have had a major impact on the economy. However, it is extremely hard to believe that the Liberals did so for economic reasons. If it was so, they would probably have been open about it and not acted the way they did. If the reason was purely rational and for the benefits of Canadians, the Liberals would have been open and transparent about it and would not have pressured and later retrograded Wilson-Raybould.

The thing is the Liberals have had many issues with ethics and corruption in the last decades, so their credibility is limited at best. And we must not forget that SNC-Lavalin is itself accused of corruption. So the whole affair is suspicious, not to say more. As for SNC-Lavalin, allegations of corruption and fraud have been made several times in the past. Since 2010, it has been caught in a fraud linked to McGill's superhospital, bribery in Bengladesh, and was denied contracts by the World Banks because of wrongdoings in Cambodia. It has been hit by the longest ban ever imposed by the World Bank. So there again, it is far from being a spotless record and the credibility is questionable.

Rémi Tremblay: In my personal opinion, many media genuinely try to understand what is going on in Ottawa. No one saw the scandal coming and Butts' resignation was a unanimous surprise. We have seen some Canadian media trying to imply that Trudeau defended SNC-Lavalin because it was from the province of Quebec or much respected CBC explaining that this was damageable for Trudeau as he had lost his only Native minister, but they really miss the point. They just prove how narrow minded they are and the CBC has truly ridiculed itself with that analysis.

What is important to note though is that most media focus on the surface: how Trudeau has handled the affair since the Globe's revelation. But this goes deeper than that. This whole affair first raises the question of corruption in Canada, an issue that is closely linked with the Liberal Party, and also the separation between justice and politics. There again, the questions raised seemed very important. Why does a politician have the power to stop prosecution or alter the course of justice? Talking about the lack of Native representation in Ottawa is a convenient way out of this debate.

ADVERTISING Read more

Singh is standing in a by-election in Burnaby South in the Vancouver metropolitan area, a crucial test for the New Democratic Party (NDP) leader ahead of October’s general elections. He is by no means a dead cert to win: at the last federal legislative vote, in 2015, the party won this seat by a mere 500 votes. And in Monday’s by-election, the two main parties, the centre-left Liberals and the Conservatives, have put up candidates against Singh, breaking with the tradition that other parties do not run candidates against leaders.

Canadian politics operates according to the Westminster model, in which the executive is drawn from the legislature – so party leaders must have a seat in the House of Commons before they can become prime minister.

He became leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) in October 2017, winning a plurality of the vote in the first round, six years after taking a seat in the Ontario provincial parliament.

‘We need to rethink what it means to be secular’

Singh was born in 1979, to parents from India’s Punjab region. Fluent in Hindi and Punjab as well as Canada’s official languages English and French, he grew up in Newfoundland on Canada’s sparsely populated east coast, before his family moved to the town of Windsor, Ontario, just across the US border.

After being called to the bar in 2006, Singh worked as a defence lawyer in the Toronto area until his election to the Ontario legislature. He has credited this work – especially pro bono work for underprivileged clients – as inspiring him to enter politics.

Indeed, Singh’s political platform is focused on social democratic policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality. Notably, he advocates increasing the national minimum wage to 15 Canadian dollars (10 euros) per hour, legalising possession of all drugs (on the grounds that “it is not a criminal justice problem” but “a social justice problem and a healthcare problem”) and the removal of tax deductions on higher-rate taxpayers.

The NDP leader has also attracted attention with his opposition to Quebec’s proposed ban on public sector workers wearing religious symbols – which would prevent him from wearing his turban if he worked for the state in the French-speaking province. In an interview with CBC, the Canadian public service broadcaster, Singh argued that “we need to rethink what it means to be secular”, and said he feels he can wear a turban to work while still following Canadian secularism. On a Québécois talk show he added that “my objective is never to convince someone else to accept my identity – it’s to convince people that I share the same progressive values as them”.

‘A very telegenic, easy-to-like guy’

Analysts say that Singh communicates his agenda with considerable charisma. “His leadership can be seen as refreshing. People saw him as this very telegenic, easy-to-like guy, who might be able to compete on the celebrity level with Trudeau,” Lori Turnbull, the director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University, told the Guardian.

Yet – for all his charisma and forthright views on such issues as drugs and secularism – it seems likely that Singh will face a tough challenge in October’s general elections. An aggregate of voter intention surveys by specialist website Calculated Politics on February 21 predicts that the NDP will win a paltry 26 seats, compared to 156 for the Liberals and 141 for the Tories. By contrast, the New Democrats managed to win 44 seats in the 2015 elections.

In a column for Canadian daily the National Post, editorialist Chris Selley pointed out that the New Democrats’ may be polling poorly despite – not because of – Singh’s leadership: “The NDP has always been a party of contradictions not so much a big tent as a tent city. It’s supposed to be a party of both champagne socialists and farmers, of both autoworkers and environmentalists, of both staunch multiculturalists and Quebec nationalists.”

Selley also argued that “if Singh wins his seat, there is reason to hope he might grow into the job. To skeptics [sic] he evinces a distinctly Trudeauvian brand of superficiality, and a similar gift for quotes that land well but fall to pieces if you actually read them back. That hasn’t hurt Trudeau, though.”

Singh has vociferously called for a public inquiry over the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which Trudeau has alleged to have pressured the justice minister – who subsequently resigned – to help the Montreal-based engineering firm avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges. However, it remains to be seen whether the NDP leader can capitalise on this issue ahead of the October elections.","Jagmeet Singh, Canada’s ‘Trudeauvian challenger to Trudeau’",France24.com,https://www.france24.com/en/20190224-jagmeet-singh-canada-trudeau-ndp-politics

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

I WAS one of four African trade unionists who observed the 2002 Zimbabwean Presidential elections under the African Union Observer Mission. The international observers including those from Nigeria, led by former Head of Interim Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan, met daily at the Sheraton Hotel to compare notes. There was a consensus that the elections in which President Robert Mugabe had 54 per cent and opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai had 40 per cent, were free and fair. It was, therefore, a shock when the Commonwealth Observer Mission led by former Nigerian Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, had a contrary report; one that was not based on observed facts.

Ukraine’s farcical drama

Based on this contrived report, then Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Australian Prime Minister, John Howard and South African President Thabo Mbeki, announced the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth claiming the elections were “marred by a high level of politically motivated violence.” Violence that was not visible to other international observers.

This confirmed my position that nothing involving human beings is value-free. Yes, humans can be objective, but in a subjective way. It is like journalism; the journalist is charged to be objective because ‘facts are sacred’. However, the angle he picks his report, the type of headline cast and the way he interprets the story, cannot be entirely objective. So it is with election monitors and observers. For example, in the 2015 Nigeria elections, the international observers were supposed to have done a clinical job. But the biases of their home governments were quite visible.

These included the refusal to sell the Jonathan government arms to fight the Boko Haram, obstructing the sale of arms by other countries and making statements that seemed innocuous, but clearly tilting towards the then opposition All Progessives Congress, APC. The international observers who are mainly Western or Western-funded, picked their cue from these. The APC benefitted from this as it coasted home to victory assisted by a gentleman President Goodluck Jonathan who insisted that his ambition for a second term was not worth the blood of a single Nigerian.

When, therefore, Western countries began to make the same seemingly innocuous statements in the run up to tomorrow’s Presidential elections, the ruling APC could see through the smokescreen and started shouting about ‘foreign intervention’. Interestingly, it does not see the visit of two governors from Niger Republic to campaign for Buhari, as foreign intervention.

The current drama began on November 18, 2018 when the European Union, EU, and some 24 countries, including the United States of America, USA, United Kingdom, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden, issued a statement which stated in part: “As friends of Nigeria and its people, we will follow the campaigns and election process closely.

Who wins the elections is for the Nigerian people to decide. Our concern is to see a process leading to free, fair, transparent and peaceful elections. We hope to see transparent campaigns and we urge all voters to use their democratic right and vote… We urge all involved to refrain from using hate speech and take a firm stance against violence.”

The APC which had tried in vain to prevent the January 17, visit to the USA by the opposition People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, could take it no more when the EU, UK and USA criticised the January 25 controversial suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen by President Buhari. Given this unprecedented Executive action, the countries had worried about the credibility of the Presidential elections.

The ruling APC’s Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State who claims to be close to President Buhari, sent out a chilling message to the Western countries and their observers: “Those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the person that would come and intervene, they would go back in body bags…Nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country. We have got our independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible and we know the history of those countries that are trying to teach us.”

To demonstrate that the governor had official backing, the APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu affirmed to the press that: “what Governor El-Rufai said, clearly, is the position of this government.” The Presidency also backed El-Rufai. Presidential Spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu in a rather ambiguous statement said: “The governor spoke strongly in defence of national interest.” In reaction, the obviously rattled Western Observers opted to stay rather than flee the country. It was left for President Buhari to assure the observers of their safety.

But I do not think the foreign observers should worry too much as they will not be the only ones in body bags; President Buhari has said those who try to disturb the electoral process or snatch ballot boxes, would also find themselves in body bags. He told the APC National Executive Council meeting this Monday: “Anybody who decides to snatch ballot boxes or lead thugs to disturb it (elections), maybe that would be the last unlawful action he would take. I have directed the police and the military to be ruthless…I am going to warn anybody who thinks he has enough influence in his locality to lead a body of thugs to snatch boxes or to disturb the voting system, he would do it at the expense of his own life.”

But who really puts much stock on what election observers think? Usually, they sanctify election results on the basis that they ‘substantially comply’ with democratic rules. In very rare cases, they cast doubts on the results. For instance, the West condemned the results of the December 30, 2018 Presidential Elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Belgium threatened to drag the country before the United Nations Security Council while French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, claimed that the results “do not conform with the results that we have noticed.” That did not stop the country from swearing in President Felix Tshisekedi.

Nigeria should consider itself lucky that the West is here to observe our elections. When Venezuela conducted its May 20, 2018 general elections and invited the EU and UN to observe, it was ignored. That did not stop the EU, USA and their allies from condemning the elections as fraudulent and recognising a fraudster who did not even contest the elections as “Acting President.”

If the foreign observers do not want to return home in body bags, they should allow Nigerians to democratically choose tomorrow, who can better stop the massacres, banditry, insecurity and impunity in the country.","Nigeria, politics of elections and International Observers",Vanguardngr.com,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/02/nigeria-politics-of-elections-and-international-observers/

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.",'Maduro must go': Pence bids to ramp up effort to oust Venezuelan leader,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/apos-maduro-must-apos-pence-193214527.html

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

21,Empty,2019-02-22T13:00:39Z,"Convincing voters is one thing, but Singh's fate may rest on whether his party is well-enough funded and organized to get those voters to the polls.","The only candidate who lives in Burnaby South and is able to vote in Monday’s federal byelection is the guy who has come the longest way to contest it, and has the most to prove and the most to lose.

Despite a history as an NDP stronghold with decades of the party’s federal and municipal politicians in control, Burnaby South is far from a safe bet for NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

His path to a win got harder when the Liberals’ first candidate resigned over racist remarks and the party appointed Richard T. Lee, who for four terms represented the provincial riding with similar boundaries.

And, for weeks now, members of Singh’s own party (including former leader Tom Mulcair) have openly talked about the Plan B that is in place in case Singh loses.

Canada’s two NDP premiers are feuding over pipelines, with Singh having sided with B.C.’s John Horgan in opposing the twinning of an existing pipeline, which Alberta’s Rachel Notley says is essential for her province.

The split intensified this week with Singh’s support for the $40-billion LNG Canada project in northern B.C. challenged by both Svend Robinson, the Burnaby North-Seymour NDP candidate in October’s federal election, and Julia Sanchez, who is running for the NDP in the Outremont byelection.

With all this going on, it’s fair to say that some party stalwarts are sitting out this byelection in a riding that the NDP barely held on to in 2015.

But fortune may still favour the Ontario-born Singh. The Liberals appear to be in meltdown, especially with all the questions about what exactly happened between former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the prime minister and his staff regarding SNC-Lavalin’s attempts to halt a federal prosecution.

As for the Conservatives, they seem to be spending a lot more time scrapping it out with Maxime Bernier’s nascent People’s Party of Canada than focusing on either Singh or the Liberals.

While environment is a top-of-mind issue here, at street level it’s housing.

In Burnaby South, 22 per cent of the residents fall below the low-income cut-off line, six percentage points higher than the Metro Vancouver average. Nearly one in four residents spends more than a third of their household income on housing.

And when you look at the average income and the average house price, the gap is unbridgeable.

As the only candidate with a home in the riding, Singh has firsthand knowledge of how hard it is to get a place to live — a problem that he says is driving the insecurity and fears of many Canadians.

Singh lost out on several rentals because he didn’t show up with a cheque for the first months’ rent. It was only after friends interceded and vouched his ability to pay the second month’s rent that Singh managed to get a place.

The riding is a perfect foil for NDP campaign promises of 500,000 units of affordable housing in the next decade, immediate investments in co-ops and non-market housing, elimination of GST on developments with a significant amount of affordable units, an increase in the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit, and relief for renters whose housing costs exceed 30 per cent of their income.

Of course, there is no chance that Singh can make any of that happen. With his party so low in the polls nationally, the best that Singh may be able to do even after the fall federal election is to push either the Liberals or the Conservatives to steal his best ideas.

But it’s immigration that has drawn the heat at all-candidates meetings.

In 2017, 13-year-old Marissa Shen was murdered in 2017 and Syrian refugee Ibrahim Ali has been charged. The case has fuelled worries about Canada’s screening of refugees and ignited ugly comments by both candidates and their supporters at raucous community gatherings.

It’s a potent issue in a riding where 54 per cent of the residents are immigrants. Of those, 89 per cent came for economic opportunity or for family reunification.

People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson has poured the most fuel on the fire, even though the Conservatives have staked it as one of their election issues. Meantime, the Tory candidate, Jay Shin, a Korean-Canadian, has tried to retain social conservatives from defecting to Thompson, a Christian TV talk show host, with brochures in English and Chinese highlighting PPC leader Maxime Bernier’s support for an NDP bill to expunge past pot convictions, and that Marc Emery, the so-called “Prince of pot”, is one of his prominent supporters.

Thompson has responded with a complaint to Elections Canada saying she doesn’t support either cannabis legalization or supervised injection sites.

Singh’s challenges are considerable. He must convince voters that he can be their most effective representative in Ottawa.

But he also needs his party’s members to believe in his leadership strongly enough that they will be there Monday to mobilize voters.

Because with voter turnout traditionally low in byelections, Singh’s fate rests as much on that as it is does on anything else.

About 48 hours later – and after weeks, if not months of repeatedly assuring the public that the commission was ready – he unexpectedly announced a one-week postponement of the elections. He set himself up not just for a fresh round of execution but also to have his remains burnt at the electoral stake.

The Yakubu picking up the pieces and rallying his team to fix Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections through a purgatory of remedial steps is a Yakubu in a bad place. Only after the elections have been successfully conducted at the same time in the 36 states and Abuja and the results announced will Mahmood Yakubu begin to get his life back.

It’s pointless going over the details of what happened. That’s old story. We have been told that a combination of logistics nightmare, bad weather – and possibly sabotage – made it impossible to go ahead with the polls last week. This was the official version. The conspiracy theories, like most conspiracy theories, were far more complicated, and even surreal.

While the version peddled in Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, circles claimed that the postponement was the fallout of resistance by Yakubu to give in to pressure by the ruling APC to stagger the elections, starting with 26 states, the common version in All Progressives Congress, APC, circles was that PDP moles in INEC compromised the system by deliberately mis-dispatching or delaying the dispatch of election materials to APC strongholds. The only things constant are Yakubu’s name and politicians’ desperation.

The promise made

I think Yakubu understands that unlike his predecessor, Attahiru Jega, he would not get another chance. He understands that unlike 2007 when significant amounts of electoral materials arrived in the country from South Africa one week after the election, voters deserve a better deal and that’s what he promised them.

He understands that unlike 2011 when the election was postponed hours after voting had commenced, or 2015 when the country was forced to shift the vote for six weeks for security reasons, voters will not accept any further excuses because that’s not what he promised them. Yakubu promised results. He promised free, fair and credible elections that will deepen voter confidence.

He has done well so far. On his watch the commission has conducted 195 rerun and off-season elections, recording fewer court-ordered re-elections than in any other elections in the last two cycles. He has recorded the largest expansion in the voter roll through continuous registration and, for the first time, made significant changes to help the physically challenged have easier access.

He has successfully planned and faithfully executed 13 of the 14 items on the 2019 election timetable, though the cost of tripping on the last task could be more disastrous that the sum total of his success so far. Yakubu has stood his grounds against party principalities and powers battling the commission in hundreds of court cases, insisting that the legal challenge, though costly, is essential to safeguard the commission’s integrity and independence.

Where the devil lies

It would appear, however, that the toughest battles he has to fight are not against politicians, who are his known enemies. The battles may not even be against the weather or logistics supply, however daunting these factors may be in a country plagued by poor infrastructure. These are small potatoes. From what he left unsaid about the possibility of a sabotage, his toughest battle may well be against insiders who betrayed him and the system in favour of politicians desperate to win at all costs. If nothing happens to the conduits inside INEC – the wolves in sheep’s clothing – the system will remain in danger. Not a witch hunt. I’m talking about a thorough root-and-branch investigation that strips every tribal covering and reveals the fraudsters for the danger they truly are.It doesn’t matter how many peace accords they sign, politicians won’t do INEC the favour of making its work easy. Politicians are in the game to win, by means fair and crooked. In their desperation they value thugs above heroes and moles above methods. But the good thing is that unlike the conduits within the commission, politicians are enemies in plain sight.If it’s true, as Yakubu said, that the commission was not under any political influence and he put his reputation on the line by repeatedly assuring voters that everything was on course, then he has serious work to do. He must fish out those in the system who seduced him with a false hope. The danger is both human and systemic.

Yakubu’s head

Some have said Yakubu should go. I disagree. We had false starts in two previous election cycles (2011 and 2015), and a near disaster in 2007 when election materials arrived in the country after the elections, forcing three out of seven Supreme Court justices to declare the results of the election a sham. We have to do more than sacrifice one man’s head to get things right: we’ll also have to examine the system closely.

The Justice Muhammed Uwais report is probably the most audacious attempt in the last 20 years to reform the electoral system, bringing it close to what exists in plural, multi-party democracies like Ghana, South Africa, India and Canada.

A number of the recommendations by the Uwais committee, including moving INEC’s funding to first line charge; use of biometrics; and continuous registration of voters, among others, have already been implemented. These changes have brought tremendous improvements to the quality of elections in the country.

An important aspect of the committee’s work, still untouched, however, is the unbundling of the commission. This aspect came to light again this week. Uwais recommended the creation of three other commissions from the existing one: one to register and regulate political parties; the other to deal with electoral offences; and the last one to handle constituency delimitation.

Unbundling INEC?

Will an “unbundled” INEC be more efficient? Will it save the country from the sort of embarrassment witnessed last week?

I doubt it. From Ghana to South Africa and from Canada to India, the election commissions perform largely similar functions with their Nigerian counterpart, though in South Africa and Canada, they are primarily answerable to the legislature.

INEC is inefficient because it has added to its own inherent problems the incompetence of other commissions set up to do precisely what it is now doing. It is plagued by the self-inflicted virus of bureaucracy-litis – the condition of adding the jobs of other failed bureaucracies to its own.

Two examples will suffice. If the National Population Commission, NPC, was doing its job, why would INEC spend billions of naira to continuously vet or update the voter register when the data could easily have been obtained from the NPC? The NPC has 22 commissioners with SUVs, fat allowances and big offices, yet the commission has not conducted a census in the last 13 years. It doesn’t even have reliable data on births and deaths.

The National Boundary Commission, NBC, is also another national joke. There are members of the commission who only remember that it exists either when they’re drawing their allowances or when they’re sending their wards or cronies to get jobs or contracts from there.

What’s the point creating new commissions from INEC that will do the jobs of the NPC, NBC or the NIMC except to multiply incompetence? If these three agencies alone can do their jobs, while citizens’ vigilance and conscience compel the security services to play a professional role, INEC’s burden would be significantly reduced.

The setback of last week should be a watershed moment to implement far-reaching reforms, from inside out, after Saturday.

An open threat – yesterday, 18 February, at a Miami University, in a speech of ‘fire and fury’; this time against socialist Venezuela with which he wants to finish, like with all other socialist nations – especially those in his ‘backyard’. So, Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia are next in Trump’s crosshairs – and / or the crosshairs of his handlers. Don’t forget, he is a staged and convenient fool for the “Deep State” or the “Profound Government” – whatever you want to call this secret clan of the Chosen People that intends to rule the world.

I cannot help being amazed at what level of inhumanity we have arrived. Trump calls openly out to assassinate those who stand behind the legitimate President of Venezuela – and the rest of the world just looks on, watches and says NOTHING – zilch, zero – tolerates such atrocity coming from the mouth of a buffoon, aka the strongman of the self-proclaimed one and only superpower of the globe. – No, much worse – the so-called civilized west, the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan – and some second- and third class puppet developing countries from South America, whose people are being starved while the elite admires and dances to the tune of the USA; united in what they call the “Group of Lima” (created in Lima in August 2017, to “safe” Venezuela). Members include, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Peru.

In the meantime, Mexico, under her new leftwing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, or simply, AMLO, abstains from any decision against Venezuela. To the contrary, Mexico is part of the “Montevideo Mechanism” that comprises Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia and the member countries of CARICOM and seeks conflict resolution through dialogue with the opposition, for which the Maduro Government has been ready from the beginning of the conflict, but which has been boycotted by the opposition, as were the 20 May 2018 elections which the non-participating opposition now calls a fraud.

The Lima Group was initiated, as such unofficial clubs always are, to out-rule the official routes, by Washington. Similarly, Washington created “The Friends of Syria” – all with the objective to bring about “Regime Change”. In the case of Venezuela, to circumvent the official representation of the Americas – the OAS – Organization of American States. – Why? – Because the empire was unable to get the legitimate majority of the OAS members to side with them against Venezuela. So, they organized the Lima Group, a club of the willing, of the utmost corrupted vassals, who believe at the end of the days to receive some crumbs of ‘gracias’ from their northern master and tyrant – or the vassals’ leaders (sic) hope perhaps for a safe haven, a castle in Miami?

I often wonder whether such a dream of eventually, at the end of the day – the end of all days perhaps? – being saved by the surviving elite of the US of A in an untouched paradise, is also the dream of the European puppets, for example those that pull the EU’s strings – the Macrons, Merkels and Mays – and, of course, the rest of the EU, the puppets of the puppets? – What else could make them so miserably betray their people, hundreds of millions of people? – Do they have not an iota of morals left?

—

Coming back to Venezuela – the Buffoon calls for outright war against the Maduro regime – and to salvage the Venezuelan people, he sent US$ 20 million worth of “humanitarian aid” to Cucutá, border town in Colombia, which, of course, the Bolivarian army does not let enter Venezuela. There is no need for humanitarian aid, let alone for US$ 20 million worth, peanuts, as compared to what Venezuela buys on a daily basis in food and medical supplies.

Undeniably, the US warmongers – specially Bolton, Pompeo and Pence – are preparing for a hot war. Whether they will execute it, remains to be seen. But the Bolivarian military does not idly watch what may happen. They are ready to face any Yankee aggression. The US southern military command, SOUTHCOM, stationed in Florida, is preparing an impressive military build-up. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, with 3,200 military personnel, 90 fighter planes and helicopters is positioned off the Florida coast, accompanied by the cruise missile carrier, USS Leyte Gulf, and the destroyers, USS Bainbridge, USS Gonzalez, USS Mason, and USS Nite. Joining the fleet is also the Spanish marine ship ESPS Mendez Nuñez.

The Spanish participation in this war game of criminal aggression is outrageous. The Spanish socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez (who certainly does not deserve the attribute of ‘socialist’), has also had the audacity requesting Nicolas Maduro to resign and call elections. Who is the (faltering) head of the fallen Spanish empire to meddle in another country’s internal affairs? – Maybe because the Spaniards can still not stomach having been defeated by Simón Bolívar, still feel superior and behave racist over the ‘brown’ Latinos, or maybe because he wants to please the masters in Washington – or simply because he needs popular support in his own country, as he is leading a minority, currently non-government and had to call snap elections for 28 April 2019?

There are, however, also Russia and China, solid, but rather quiet partners of Venezuela’s. Russia has made it clear, though, “Don’t mess with Venezuela”. Russia has two nuclear capable bombers, TU-160, deployed to the Venezuelan Caribbean island of la Orchila, where Moscow will establish, with the agreement of Venezuela, a permanent military base.

Both Russia and China have tens of billions worth of investments in Venezuela’s hydrocarbon industry. But besides the commercial interests, Russia and China vie for a multipolar world and want to guarantee the independence of Latin America, the sovereignty of the peoples of the Americas.

On 26 January 2019, the US dragged the “Case Venezuela” to the UN Security Council, in an attempt to condemn Venezuela and to trailblaze the path for a military invasion. However, while nine of the 15 UNSC members voted for a special meeting on Venezuela (Belgium, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Kuwait, Peru, Poland, United Kingdom, United States), four voted against (China, Equatorial Guinea, Russian Federation, South Africa), with two abstentions (Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia). The Russian Federation’s delegate countered that the Council has no role to play in a domestic matter that poses no threat to international peace and security. And right he is!

This UNSC event prompted a solidarity movement of more than 50 states, including China, Russia, Cuba, DPRK, Syria, Iran, Palestine, Nicaragua, and many more, supporting Venezuelan’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza’s statement before the Security Council, declaring the illegality of unilateral coercive economic sanctions, and territorial invasions by the United States. As Carla Stea reports,

this new alliance “constitutes a formidable force which Western capitalism will antagonize at its own peril. This is a long overdue counterforce to Western domination of the United Nations, a domination based on money, on the large payments enabling the US and other capitalist powers to bribe, threaten and otherwise control the direction of the UN, and distort and destroy the independence, impartiality and integrity which the UN requires in order to maintain its legitimacy, and implement the sustained global peace and justice for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt created it.”

This new alignment of more than 50 states comprise more than half of the world’s population, to a large extent people who have been exploited, slaughtered and their countries raped and ravaged for hundreds of years by wester capitalist and colonialist powers. This alliance promises to become a solid new face in the otherwise western dominated and bought United Nations.

As to Venezuela’s fate, Trump has made vague indications of 23 February being the deadline for an assault on Venezuela. We will see whether this remains nothing but an intimidating insinuation, or whether it will be real. The latter case would be a disaster not only for Venezuela, and Latin America, but for the entire world. Will Trump’s handlers allow such blunder? – In any case, Venezuela’s armed forces are disposed to confront the empire’s nuclear aircraft carrier, missile launchers, countless fighter planes and the up to 5,000 US troops and mercenaries newly stationed in Colombia and ready to cross the border into Venezuela. – And, not to forget, there are also Russia and China.

25,Empty,2019-02-22T16:38:23Z,"Beijing’s race to control supplies of lithium, used in powering electric cars, is leaving its rivals far behind.","China is increasingly dominating the supply of what’s been described as “white petroleum,” the soft, silvery metal lithium, seen as key to the momentum-gathering electric vehicle (EV) revolution.

Discoveries of lithium in North America and Europe may loosen China’s tightening hold on the market in time, but the race to find and exploit new deposits is also throwing up other concerns, namely the risk of oversupply or even a glut and political risks that may affect countries with some of the biggest reserves and production.

Lithium is one of the main components of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones, laptops, and EVs, with demand for the latter anticipated to surge over the next decade or so as manufacturing costs fall and environmental concerns rise. China, eager to reduce oil imports and address chronic air pollution, is driving production of EVs, accounting for 37 percent of passenger EVs sold globally since 2011, according to Bloomberg. The agency forecast in 2017 that by 2040 more than half of all new car sales will be electric vehicles.

Beijing government subsidies and quotas for EV sales appear to have incentivized efforts to corner the electric vehicle supply chain. Reuters reports that Chinese entities now control nearly half of global lithium production and 60 percent of the electric battery production capacity. By 2030, Goldman Sachs predicts China could supply 60 percent of the world’s EVs.

In recent years, China, the biggest global consumer of lithium, has been snapping up stakes in mining operations in South America and Australia, the principal global sources of the metal – derived from brine flats in South America and spodumene ore in Australia. In South America alone, China has reportedly invested $4.2 billion in lithium deals in the past two years. It has also been tightening its grip on the supply of cobalt, another important lithium-ion battery component.

Beijing’s buying spree has worried electric battery- and EV-makers in Japan, South Korea, and Europe. But China has not had it all its own way. In a recent reversal of fortunes, a German company beat off a Chinese challenge in Bolivia – which has one of the world’s largest reserves of lithium – to secure a deal to build a plant mining the country’s biggest deposit. Most of the output will go to Germany, which lobbied heavily for the deal that includes the construction of a rechargeable battery plant.

Yet, not to be outdone, and in a measure of its determination, Beijing quickly sought to secure a foothold in Bolivia with a mining venture in another promising prospect in the country. The Chinese ambassador to Bolivia described the preliminary deal as “historic.” That came just weeks after one of China’s leading miners, Tianqi, completed the purchase of a 24 percent stake in neighboring Chile’s lithium producer SQM, fending off local opposition to the deal – centered on concerns it would unfairly favor the Chinese in the contest to secure resources for EVs.

China’s increasing domination of the global lithium supply appears to have prodded the Europeans and the Americans, whose EV markets are still very much in their infancy, to explore closer to home. Deposits in Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal, and Sweden have been the focus of attention, while some within the industry have expressed hopes that Canada might have sufficient volumes to meet demand in North America.

But the race for supplies has sparked concerns about the pace of production output. Extraction has been fueled by soaring lithium prices, which more than tripled in the three years to 2018 to over $20,000 per tonne. The data and analytics company GlobalData predicted in September that EV demand will double global lithium production from 26,700 tonnes in 2018 to 58,300 tonnes in 2022. In August, Macquarie Research suggested that the market was “sleepwalking into a tsunami of oversupply.” Then in late November, Moody’s Investor Services warned of excessive production in the early years of the next decade, due to factors including a “heavy concentration” of new mines.

Oversupply left its mark last year when lithium prices in China nearly halved, a problem compounded by the government’s removal of some subsidies on EVs, which slowed sales. Some analysts believe the market will recover in the medium to long term as demand increases, but the risk is that the slough may discourage investment in new production, leading to shortages when prices pick up. Yet that may not be the only break on supply.

President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, a top lithium producer, has opened up the country’s economy, introducing market reforms and easing regulations, but his attempts to repair the economic mismanagement of his predecessors are misfiring, plunging the county into a financial crisis that forced him to go cap in hand to the IMF. His ratings have shrunk, raising the prospect of a populist victory in elections later this year. That might make life difficult for mining investors, especially if his reformist agenda is reversed.

While Bolivia has barely begun to export its lithium, it has huge potential as a supplier – potential being the operative word. The country’s left-wing leader, Evo Morales, recognizes the value of the resource to Bolivian economic prospects. But if he is re-elected in October, investors may be put off if interventionist policies introduced in other sectors are extended to lithium production.

It is unclear how China will deal with such challenges, but given its relentless pursuit of lithium, and the strategic importance it attaches to the metal, solutions will no doubt be found. In many ways, China’s embrace of green transport is a good thing, as it expands interest in the sector and spurs competitor nations to try to catch up in terms of their share of lithium supply and the rechargeable battery market. The danger is that they continue to lag behind, leaving China with a monopoly over what could soon become a mainstream transport sector.

Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.

What can be anticipated, however, is that there will be further intensified pressure on the regime, which will squeeze it like the large anacondas that inhabit Venezuelan waters. In addition to efforts to entice regime officials, including the military, to shift their loyalty from Maduro to Guaido, the United States, in coordination with other nations, looks to amplify asset seizure and forfeiture. Collectively, they aim to deny new and cancel existing visas for regime officials and their families, thus forcing departures from the United States, Europe, and Latin American nations that host them, and increase humanitarian assistance. All of these activities will further the goal of turning Maduro into an international pariah, and, it is hoped, create conditions that will ultimately see him turfed from office.

The key is to keep the Maduro regime on the defensive. There are no guarantees, and nobody can say when the dam will ultimately break—or if it will break. Meanwhile, Venezuelans face an unpleasant choice between protesting and exposing themselves to the excesses of the regime, hunkering down, or joining the millions of Venezuelans who have already left their nation behind. It is a tragedy lain squarely at the feet of Chavismo.

In an interview with Univision’s Jorge Ramos, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has just announced that he will run for US president in the 2020 election, has refused to recognise Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president, having suggested that the US should ensure “free and fair” elections in the Latin American country.

“No. I think what has to happen right now — I think there are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election, and I think the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela”, Sanders said.

When asked whether he believes that Nicolas Maduro is a “dictator” and should step down, Sanders seemingly avoided giving a direct answer to the question:

“I think clearly he has been very, very abusive. That is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there’s got to be a free and fair election”.

Sanders’ reluctance to recognise Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president came shortly before the opposition leader issued his “presidential” decree number 001 in order to authorise the deliveries of humanitarian aid currently stockpiled in neighbouring Colombia.

His decision was made despite President Nicolas Maduro’s strong opposition to the deliveries, which he said might be used as a pretext for a foreign intervention in Venezuela.

White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, in turn, said that the Venezuelan military, who support the Maduro government, should let “peaceful civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders peacefully bring in humanitarian aid”, warning that any infractions “will not be forgotten”.

Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump called on Venezuelan military officers to not follow orders given by Maduro to block the humanitarian aid deliveries to the country, adding that Washington is seeking a peaceful transition of power in the country but ""all options"" were on the table.

In the meantime, Maduro said Thursday that he sees a certain connection between Washington's rhetoric against Venezuela and the re-election campaign of Trump.

""Donald Trump has started his pre-election campaign… He's desperate, and so he really liked the idea of attacking Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, and he thinks that, using this rhetoric of Cold War, he will improve [his rating], which in reality could lead to his total collapse"", Maduro said in remarks broadcast by a local TV channel.

Tensions have been simmering in Venezuela since mid-January when Guaido declared himself the country’s president, challenging last May’s re-election of Maduro. The United States, Canada, Japan, Israel, a host of Latin American countries and a number of European nations have recognised the opposition leader, while Russia, Turkey, China, Mexico, and many others have voiced their support for Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimately elected president.

(“Pan American” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PAAS) (TSX:PAAS) and Tahoe Resources Inc. (“Tahoe”) (TSX:THO) (NYSE: TAHO) today completed the previously announced transaction (the “Arrangement”) whereby Pan American acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Tahoe.

Michael Steinmann, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pan American Silver, said: "" The completion of the Arrangement establishes the world's premier silver mining company with an industry-leading portfolio of assets, a robust growth profile and attractive operating margins. We are also now the largest publicly traded silver mining company by free float, offering silver mining investors enhanced scale and liquidity.""

Added Mr. Steinmann: ""We have a 25-year track record in Latin America of building successful partnerships with the communities around our operations, respecting the diversity of local populations and safeguarding the natural environment. We welcome the opportunity to work with local communities around the new operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.""

Results of elections by Tahoe shareholders

Pursuant to the Arrangement, Tahoe shareholders had the right to elect to receive either US$3.40 in cash (the “Cash Election”) or 0.2403 of a Pan American share (the “Share Election”) for each Tahoe share, subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum cash consideration of US$275 million and a maximum number of Pan American shares issued of 56.0 million. Tahoe shareholders who did not make an election by the deadline of 4:30 pm EST on January 3, 2019 were deemed to have made the Share Election.

The following elections were made:

holders of 23,661,084 Tahoe shares made the Cash Election; and

holders of 290,226,406 Tahoe shares made, or were deemed to have made, the Share Election.

Since the aggregate number of Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration (as defined in the Arrangement agreement dated as of November 14, 2018 among Pan American, Tahoe and 0799714 B.C. Ltd.), holders of Tahoe shares who made or were deemed to have made the Share Election are subject to pro-ration in the manner described in Tahoe's management information circular dated December 4, 2018 and will receive consideration per Tahoe share of approximately 19.7% in cash (US$0.67) and approximately 80.3% in Pan American shares (0.1929 of a Pan American share). Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made will receive all cash consideration.

In addition, Tahoe shareholders received contingent consideration in the form of one contingent value right (""CVR"") for each Tahoe share. Each CVR will be exchanged for 0.0497 of a Pan American share upon first commercial shipment of concentrate following restart of operations at the Escobal mine. The CVRs are transferable and have a term of 10 years.

In aggregate, Pan American will pay US$275 million in cash and issue 55,990,512 Pan American shares and 313,887,490 CVRs to Tahoe shareholders under the Arrangement. Upon closing of the Arrangement, existing Pan American and former Tahoe shareholders own approximately 73% and 27% of Pan American, respectively. Upon satisfaction of the payment conditions under the terms of the CVRs, Pan American and Tahoe shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the combined company (based upon the number of Pan American shares outstanding as at today’s date).

C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes appointed to Pan American Board

Under the Arrangement, Tahoe was entitled to nominate two of its directors to join Pan American’s Board of Directors. Tahoe has nominated Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes. Effective today, Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes joined Pan American’s Board of Directors.

"" Kevin and Chuck are seasoned mining executives with deep knowledge of the precious metals industry. I warmly welcome them to Pan American's Board of Directors,"" said Mr. Ross J. Beaty, Chairman of Pan American.

Increase to, and drawdown under, Pan American’s revolving credit facility

Pan American is also pleased to announce that it has amended and extended its revolving credit facility led by The Bank of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The facility has been increased by US$200 million to US$500 million, and matures on February 1, 2023. At Pan American’s option, amounts can be drawn under the revolving facility and will incur interest based on the Company’s leverage ratio at either (i) LIBOR plus 1.875% to 2.750% or; (ii) The Bank of Nova Scotia’s Base Rate on U.S. dollar denominated commercial loans plus 0.875% to 1.750%. Undrawn amounts under the revolving facility are subject to a stand-by fee of 0.4219% to 0.6188% per annum, dependent on the Company’s leverage ratio.

Pan American has drawn down US$301 million under the facility under LIBOR-based interest rates to fund, in part, the cash purchase price under the Arrangement and to repay, in full, and cancel Tahoe’s second amended and restated revolving facility, under which US$125 million had been drawn.

Delisting of Tahoe shares

The shares of Tahoe are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange as of the closing of the market on February 26, 2019 and on the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the closing of the market on March 4, 2019, subject to the approval of each exchange. Pan American has applied for Tahoe to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws and will file to suspend Tahoe’s reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws.

Former president Abdoulaye Wade called for protests against the polls after his son was banned from running.","Senegal's presidential candidates had three weeks to convince voters that they have got what it takes to be elected head of the country. Five candidates are in the race for the office of president in one of Africa's most stable democracies. Incumbent president Macky Sall is seeking his final five-year mandate after coming to power with a seven-year mandate in 2012. A 2016 referendum slashed the seven-year presidential term to five and reaffirmed the two-term limit.

Sall is up against two strong and experienced aspirants: former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck and former Foreign Affairs Minister Madicke Niang. Seck is making his third bid for the top job. The 59-year-old promised to build a modern hospital and a local university in each of the country's 45 departments, as well as a health center in each commune. 65-year-old Madicke Niang wants to reform the justice system.

Senegal's President Macky Sall is running for a second term

Specific electoral programs

El Hadji Issa Sall, an academic and lawmaker, and Ousmane Sonko, who is the youngest contestant, are the outsiders in the race. 63-year-old Sall has promised to clean up dangerous suburbs and revamp fish processing plants down the coast. 44-year-old Sonko is a rising opposition figure — he pledged to renegotiate all gas and mining contracts that have already been signed by the current regime. Another two major aspirants, Karim Wade and Khalifa Sall, were barred by the top court over corruption.

Political analyst Gilles Yabi praises the electoral programs

Dr Gilles Yabi, director of WATHI, a pan African think tank, welcomed the candidates' efforts to propose specific electoral programs – something he says is not usually associated with elections in African countries. ""I think this is something that merits praise,"" he said. ""There are many elements regarding the justice system in all the programs, such as the construction of a new prison and the setting up of reintegration program for detainees on their release."" There would also be incentives and obligations for companies to recruit handicapped people with a specific salary, with penalties to be paid if this is not respected, Yabi added. ""There is definitely an effort to present original programs.""

Ex-President Wade calls for protests

But the campaign has not been all smooth sailing. Violence broke out in Tambadounda in the south-east of the country, leaving at least two people dead and 24 arrested. Many others were injured following violent clashes between supporters of incumbent Macky Sall and those of El Hadj Issa Sall. As a result, El-Hadji Issa Sall and Ousmane Sonko's parties decided to take a break and stop their campaign caravans.

It is the first time so few candidates are running in a presidential election since 1988. Tensions are running high in the country dubbed the most stable in West Africa. Ex-president Abdoulaye Wade called on voters to burn down polling stations and their voting cards in protest that his own son is barred from running. His party, the main opposition Democratic Party of Senegal (PDS), is not fielding a candidate. Abdoulaye Wade had called for a boycott of the vote citing threats to security but the government dismissed his call.

Content over personality

Interior Minister Aly Ngouille Ndiaye had given an assurance that the elections would be carried out transparently and said rigging was impossible. However, many Dakar residents are not convinced. Complaints about delays in the issuing of voter ID cards became loud, residents claimed that some people had been waiting for years and still had not received their voting cards. Social media users had also pushed for a first-ever televised pre-election debate with all five candidates, but the National Audiovisual Regulatory Council announced that it would not authorize national television and radio channels to broadcast such a program in the context of the current election campaign.

100 observers from the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland and Canada will accompany the election. International communications consultant Amy Sarr Fall thinks that once at the voting booth, people will choose content over personality. ""Citizens will ask themselves: Who will help me best to face what awaits me after the election? Who will help me keep my business efficient, who will help me keep my head above water in a difficult economy - and who will help me keep my job?""",Five presidential candidates for Senegal,Dw.com,https://www.dw.com/en/five-presidential-candidates-for-senegal/a-47629990

Outremont's polls are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,"Liberal Rachel Bendayan has won the federal riding of Outremont in Quebec after taking 40 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of polls reporting.

""I will honour your vote by working very hard,"" she said Monday night at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal's Outremont.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Outremont resident, Claudette Dumas Bergen, says the weather was holding her back but she adds “my civic duty came to me and I said I have to go because it’s important!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Outremont?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Outremont</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCMontreal</a> <a href=""https://t.co/H6ds1wsZZ4"">pic.twitter.com/H6ds1wsZZ4</a> —@mia_anhoury

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

These are the candidates who ran in Outremont and how much of the vote they took by the time 95 per cent of ballots had been counted:

40 per cent: Rachel Bendayan — Liberal Party of Canada.

29 per cent: Julia Sánchez — New Democratic Party.

The post Naomi Klein: The Green New Deal Is Changing the Calculus of the Possible appeared first on The Nation.,"Naomi Klein is the author of the best sellers No Is Not Enough, This Changes Everything, The Shock Doctrine, and No Logo. She’s a member of the board of directors of the international climate-action group 350.org. And she’s a senior correspondent for the Intercept, a contributor to The Nation, and the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University. Ad Policy

Listen to Naomi Klein on the Start Making Sense podcast.

Jon Wiener: How would you describe the Green New Deal resolution introduced by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey?

Naomi Klein: It’s a sweeping plan to radically transform how we get energy, move ourselves around, live in cities, and grow our food; and it puts justice at the center—justice broadly defined, from racial and gender justice to making sure no worker is left behind, battling inequality at every level. It’s really about multitasking. It’s about understanding that we are in a time of multiple overlapping crises, and that we are on an incredibly tight deadline when it comes to lowering greenhouse-gas emissions in time to prevent truly catastrophic warming. In order to bring people along with these necessary changes, there have to be benefits in the here-and-now in terms of the kinds of jobs that are provided and the justice that comes through.

JW: The Green New Deal, you’ve said, is not a question that will be settled through elections alone. What do you mean?

NK: In terms of winning the power to introduce a package as ambitious as the resolution, the only real historical precedent is the original New Deal. And the political dynamics that produced the original New Deal were not a benevolent politician handing reforms down from on high, from the goodness of his heart. Of course it mattered to have FDR in power instead of Herbert Hoover, but it mattered even more to have an organized population which was flexing its muscles in every conceivable way in the 1930s—from sit-down strikes in auto plants, to shutting down the ports on the West Coast, to shutting down entire cities with general strikes. And it mattered also to have more radical voices who were calling for more radical policies than the New Deal was offering, like a truly cooperative economy. All of that created the context in which FDR was able to sell the New Deal to elites. They were grudging about it, but the alternative seemed to be political revolution.

So the only way that something like this happens is if it is accompanied by a huge grassroots mobilization, where every workplace, every sector, every movement is asking, “What would a Green New Deal mean for us? What would it mean in our workplace? What would it mean for the groups that we represent?” If we are going to succeed, they need to make it their own. So it’s going to take a hell of a lot of grassroots organizing, mobilizing all of these sectors to really believe that the Green New Deal is going to make their lives better, coupled with politicians running at every level of government, including for president, with a promise to enact this on day one.

JW: Building political power, you’ve said, is about changing the calculus of what is possible. That’s a big obstacle. We saw that in a column by Gail Collins in The New York Times last week: She argued the Green New Deal is too far-reaching and instead we should focus our efforts on more manageable things like creating more electric generating capacity from solar and wind. It’s not exactly opposing the Green New Deal, but it’s certainly not helping. Current Issue View our current issue

NK: There is this idea that a more incrementalist policy focused just on climate would be more sellable—something that doesn’t talk about fighting inequality, and a huge jobs program, and health care for all. But what’s actually stood in the way of strong climate policy in the past has been that, in times of real economic stress, like the ones we’ve been living in, people consistently rank climate below health care and below jobs. Often it ranks last on the list of political priorities. And that’s why politicians always feel that it can be sacrificed. Obama did that. He looked at the polls and he prioritized health care. And when that led to a huge amount of pushback, he didn’t spend any political capital trying to get a cap-and-trade policy through—even though that was totally inadequate.

And the other thing that stands in the way when politicians actually do introduce climate policies, is that, if they don’t prioritize justice, the proposals are actively unjust. For example, look to Emmanuel Macron in France, where this very neoliberal president introduced a tax cut for the very, very rich at the same time that he introduced a carbon-pricing scheme that increased the cost of living for working people. Then you had an uprising, and rioting in the streets, with the yellow vest movement—precisely because, as one of the protesters put it, “The politicians care about the end of the world when we have to care about the end of the month.” I think the brilliance of the Green New Deal framework is that it doesn’t ask people to choose. It says, “We all care about the end of the world. But we also care about the end of the month. So how do we design policies that simultaneously lower emissions and lower that economic strain?” And that’s exactly what they’re trying to do.

JW: There has been opposition to climate change legislation from the Laborers International Union and some of the building trades. But one of the unions that’s been really good on this is the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.

NK: I’ve been involved in a project in Canada called the Leap Manifesto, which is our people’s version of a Green New Deal, to get off fossil fuels in a hurry, but to put justice and labor protections at the center. After the Leap Manifesto came out, our team worked with that union, at their request, to come up with a plan to apply the principles of the Leap Manifesto to the Post Office—which, at that time, was facing a very real prospect of being privatized and radically downsized. So rather than just saying, “We want to keep things as they are, despite the fact that how we tend to send mail has been radically changed by Amazon and by courier services,” they said, “We want to change this service that has been at the center of communities for so long, and we want to now be at the center of a transition off of fossil fuels. We want to have postal banking, we want to have solar panels on the rooftops of every post office, we want a charging station outside, we want a fleet of vehicles that are all electric and all made domestically, and we want not just to be delivering the mail, but also to be delivering locally grown produce, checking in on the elderly, being part of the caring economy.” It’s a radical plan that’s being championed by an unabashedly progressive union. And coming back to where we started, that’s what it means to make the Green New Deal your own. We need people in every organized workplace to be getting together and imagining what their workplace would look like if they took rapid de-carbonization seriously.

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

34,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:28Z,It's a tale of two creditors – each with distinct foreign policy goals.,"A month ago, Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaidó refused to recognize the legitimacy of President Nicolás Maduro’s fraudulent May 2018 reelection. Guaidó declared himself interim president, calling for new elections — and quickly garnered the support of the United States, Canada, most of the European Union and a dozen Latin American nations.

Absent from that list are two countries with major financial interests in Venezuela: China and Russia. It has been a tale of two creditors, each with a concentrated financial exposure to Venezuela yet distinct foreign policy aims. Our research, reflected in two recently published Wilson Center reports, examines these differences in Chinese-Venezuelan and Russian-Venezuelan economic relations. Here’s what you need to know:

1. For China, oil ties mean Beijing has to be pragmatic about nonintervention.

On the eve of the global financial crisis, President Hugo Chávez and President Hu Jintao laid the foundations of the China-Venezuela state-to-state relationship when they crafted their first loans-for-oil deals in 2007. Chávez was able to court a creditor to help expand the Venezuelan state. For Beijing, Venezuela’s abundant natural resources and energy supplies could help China secure long-term access to these vital national assets.

By 2014, China’s main policy bank, the China Development Bank (CDB), had provided the Venezuelan government with more than $30 billion in new oil-backed loans. They had mainly supported investment in the energy and mining sectors, including power stations, oil refineries and pipelines. However, the initial discretionary nature of these policy bank loans also meant that Venezuela used the proceeds for infrastructure projects in a variety of other sectors, including agriculture, telecommunications, housing and forestry.

[Here are the 3 big shifts in Venezuela that you probably missed — and will change what comes next]

China’s policy banks hoped to avoid the failings of other creditors in Latin America by circumventing the need for policy conditionality with commercial conditions. Beijing used loans-for-oil deals, wagering that the production capacity of Venezuela’s state oil company (PDVSA) was a sufficient guarantee for debt repayment.

This was a miscalculation. China overestimated Venezuela’s ability to sustain oil production and, hence, economic activity, but also its ability to successfully manage several commercial projects that were spread across broad sectors of the economy. China thus paid a high cost when Venezuela fell into arrears on its oil collateral and failed to finance transportation projects in 2014 amid the country’s worsening economic crisis and historic oil sector collapse.

As Venezuela’s economy worsened, China grew cautious

With China’s loans tied to oil production, China’s policy banks were compelled to lend defensively — rolling over about $9 billion of existing bilateral funds — in the hope of boosting Venezuela crude output and recovering their oil collateral. But Beijing also grew reluctant to extend any new financial arrangements, as China became more circumspect about Maduro’s ability to manage the economy. At its peak, between 2010 and 2013, Venezuela accounted for an average of 64 percent of China’s new approved lines of credit to Latin America. But from 2014 to 2017, Venezuela represented 18 percent of China’s total new lines of credit to the region.

[Why did China stand by Maduro in Venezuela?]

China’s strategy revolves around a pragmatic commitment to “nonintervention,” protecting its considerable financial commitments by hedging politically as well as commercially. Chinese leaders courted Venezuela’s opposition leaders during the 2012 presidential and the 2015 parliamentary elections. Guaidó representatives reportedly met with Chinese officials last week to discuss Venezuela’s $20 billion outstanding debt to China.

Guaidó has sought to build on this diplomatic momentum, saying that China’s “support will be very important in boosting our country’s economy and future development.” In Beijing, a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seemed to reciprocate, saying, “No matter how the situation evolves, China-Venezuela cooperation should not be undermined.”

2. Russia is looking to boost both its geopolitical and economic capital

Beginning in 2015, as China grew more cautious and concerned about its exposure in Venezuela, Russia provided about $6.5 billion in new funds through its state-owned enterprise, Rosneft, to Venezuela’s state-owned oil company. Previously, the cornerstone of the Russia-Venezuelan relationship had been military ties, with Venezuela buying more than $4 billion in Russian arms and military equipment.

By financially backing the Maduro regime, Russia seized an opportunity to signal its return to the global and hemispheric stage with a symbolic move in Venezuela, a country in close U.S. proximity. Moscow also demonstrated to its hemispheric allies, such as Cuba and Nicaragua, that it could both exercise Latin American influence and challenge U.S. geopolitical interests.

In the wake of Guaidó’s political ascension, Russia drafted a U.N. resolution expressing “its concerns over threats to use force” against Venezuela. Russia fired a rhetorical shot across the U.S.’s foreign policy bow, warning that “the cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state” must stop. Venezuela’s military, an ongoing supporter of the Maduro regime, has relied on Russia for military equipment — circumventing U.S. sanctions.

Russia’s motivations were largely political

The guiding principles of Russia’s involvement in the oil and gas sectors are also mostly political rather than commercial. In a recent Wilson Center report, analyst Vladimir Rouvinski suggests that Russian political elites “sincerely believe there is an opportunity to improve the situation sometime in the future with Chavistas still in control of Venezuela.”

Russia’s state-owned enterprises emerged as key investors at a time when the Maduro government found it increasingly difficult to secure new credit from anywhere, including China. Rosneft and Gazprom, Russia’s energy giants, provided valued short-term financing to Venezuela’s crumbling oil-state company (PDVSA).

In exchange, PDVSA provided 49.9 percent of its total shares from its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo, as collateral to Rosneft to guarantee future payments. Furthermore, Rosneft has increased in equity stake in the Orinoco’s heavy oil belt joint venture and has also received access to the largest gas reserves in Venezuela.

[Will Venezuela’s military back — or abandon — Maduro? Here are the 4 things it will consider.]

But Moscow appears to be learning from China’s Venezuelan hedge by diversifying its strategic hand beyond the geopolitical card. Facing mounting financial arrears, vulnerable supply chains, U.S. court battles over Citgo shares used as loan collateral, and U.S. sanctions on the Rosneft CEO, there are limits to how far Rosneft can extend its financial exposure in Venezuela.

Rosneft is Russia’s largest oil producer and second-largest gas-producing firm — this means Russia has to protect the company’s commercial interests. Recently, Russia appears to be counterbalancing the tough geopolitical rhetoric with a softer push, saying, “The only way out of this crisis is for the government and opposition to sit down for negotiations.” Notwithstanding ongoing uncertainty regarding Venezuela’s political future, it is clear that both China and Russia plan to be a part of Venezuela’s economic future.

HR1 (text here) was, symbolically, the first bill introduced in this session of the House, and it rapidly aqquired 227 co-sponsors — of whom not one was a Republican. The bill garnered a lot of positive coverage. From the Brennan Center for Justice:

The Brennan Center has long advocated for, and in many cases helped innovate, many of the reforms outlined in H.R. 1. “Perhaps more than ever, Americans understand the problems facing our democracy,” said Weiser. “They are hungry for bold and effective solutions to those problems — like those in H.R. 1 — and real action on those solutions.” Weiser submitted written testimony in support of the Act in advance of Thursday’s hearing. In her comments on Thursday, she highlighted three of the reforms outlined in H.R. 1: Restoring the Voting Rights Act, a landmark civil rights law that was hobbled by the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision;

a landmark civil rights law that was hobbled by the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision; Automatic voter registration (AVR), which would streamline how Americans register to vote — and could add up to 50 million new voters to the rolls; and

which would streamline how Americans register to vote — and could add up to 50 million new voters to the rolls; and Small-donor public financing, which would amplify the voices of ordinary voters by providing public funds to match small donors. Thursday marked the latest in a series of hearings on H.R. 1, which have focused on elements of the bill ranging from presidential ethics to election security. The bill marks the first time in decades that either major political party has made comprehensive reform of the systems of democracy a central priority.

(Let me pause to compliment the Brennan Center for not using the noxious phrase “our democracy.” As the old joke goes, “What do you mean, ‘we’?”) Democrat House organ The New Yorker:

[Last week,] a hearing on H.R. 1, the For the People Act, took place in the House of Representatives. Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the new chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, referred to the bill, in his opening remarks, as “one of the boldest reform packages to be considered in the history of this body.” He added, “This sweeping legislation will clean up corruption in government, fight secret money in politics, and make it easier for American citizens across this great country to vote.” That statement was not partisan hyperbole. The bill is a broad, imaginative, and ambitious set of responses to the most pressing challenges facing American democracy, many of which preceded the 2016 election, but almost all of which were brought into sharper focus by it. Implicit in the choice to take up an electoral-reform bill as the first act of the new Democratic majority in the House was the decision to confront not only these injustices but, more fundamentally, the forces that have allowed them to come into existence. The bill contains provisions to insure access to paper ballots, in order to verify the accuracy of voting results; to establish early voting in all states for federal elections; and to launch independent redistricting commissions, to address the problem of partisan gerrymandering.

(“Access” to paper ballots. Oh.) Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a scathing WaPo Op-Ed, dubbed it “the Democrat Politician Protection Act,” and given what we know about how the liberal Democrat establishment operates, it would be strange indeed if the bill did work in their favor, institutionally. Now, I have no doubt that there are good things in the bill; but it’s 600 pages long, and I don’t have time to go through it all to find them. I do think, however, that the bill presents four major problems: Two Easter Eggs, little hidden surprises, and two Trojan Horses, something seemingly benign that is in fact destructive (in this case, of democracy, ironically enough in a bill titled “For the People”). The two Easter Eggs are raised barriers to small parties and digital voting; the two Trojan Horses are a role for the intelligence community, and the nature of campaign contribututions.

Easter Egg: Barriers to Small Parties

Bruce Dixon comments:

HR 1 is surgically aimed to eliminate federal matching funds for Green Party candidates by raising the qualifying amount from its current level of $5,000 in each of 20 states to $25,000 in 20 states. HR 1 would cut funding for a Green presidential candidate in half, and by making ballot access for a Green presidential candidate impossible in several states it would also guarantee loss of the party’s ability to run for local offices.

From the Bill:

SEC. 5202. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING PAYMENTS. (a) Amount Of Aggregate Contributions Per State; Disregarding Of Amounts Contributed In Excess Of $200.—Section 9033(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended— (1) by striking “$5,000” and inserting “$25,000”; and (2) by striking “20 States” and inserting the following: “20 States (disregarding any amount of contributions from any such resident to the extent that the total of the amounts contributed by such resident for the election exceeds $200)”.

Easter Egg: Digital Voting

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!–Edsger W. Dijkstra

In other words, digital must be removed everywhere in the voting and tabulating process, because otherwise the vote is vulnerable to hacking and election fraud. That’s why hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public, are the world standard. To quote another programming proverb: “The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there” (Gordon Bell).

From the Bill; I’ve helpfully underlined and noted in square brackets the problematic portions of the text:

SEC. 1502. PAPER BALLOT AND MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS. (a) In General.—Section 301(a)(2) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(2)) is amended to read as follows: “(2) PAPER BALLOT REQUIREMENT.— “(A) VOTER-VERIFIED PAPER BALLOTS.— “(i) PAPER BALLOT REQUIREMENT.— (I) The voting system shall require the use of an individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot of the voter’s vote that shall [A] be marked and made available for inspection and verification by the voter before the voter’s vote is cast and counted, and which shall be counted by hand [B] or read by an optical character recognition device or other counting device . For purposes of this subclause, the term ‘individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot’ means a paper ballot marked by the voter by hand [C] or a paper ballot marked through the use of a nontabulating ballot marking device or system , [D] so long as the voter shall have the option to mark his or her ballot by hand . “(II) The voting system shall provide the voter with an opportunity to correct any error on the paper ballot before the permanent voter-verified paper ballot is preserved in accordance with clause (ii). “(III) The voting system shall not preserve the voter-verified paper ballots in any manner that makes it possible, at any time after the ballot has been cast, to associate a voter with the record of the voter’s vote without the voter’s consent. “(ii) PRESERVATION AS OFFICIAL RECORD.—The individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot used in accordance with clause (i) shall constitute the official ballot and shall be preserved and [E] used as the official ballot for purposes of any recount or audit conducted with respect to any election for Federal office in which the voting system is used. “(iii) MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOUNTS AND AUDITS.— (I) Each paper ballot used pursuant to clause (i) shall be suitable for a manual audit, and shall be counted by hand in any recount or audit conducted with respect to any election for Federal office.

[A] “be marked” leaves the agent doing the marking unspecified (see notes [C] and [D).

[B] “or read by an optical character recognition device or other counting device” means that the count need not be by hand, and need not be public.

[C] “marked through the use of a nontabulating ballot marking device or system,” for example, hackable touch screens.

[D] “shall have the option to mark his or her ballot by hand” means that voting machine vendors can use UI/UX “dark patterns” to discourage hand-marking.

[E] “used as the official ballot for purposes of any recount” means that the paper ballot is not the official ballot (!!) until a recount is performed. But how do we know to perform a recount if an election has been successfully hacked? Why not just make the paper ballot the official ballot to begin with[1], and get rid of all the digital cruft, as they do in Canada, Germany, and the UK?[2]

Collectively, the notes show that the section title — “Subtitle F—Promoting Accuracy, Integrity, And Security Through Voter-Verified Permanent Paper Ballot” — is at best deceptive and at worse a bait-and-switch. This entire section is so sloppy and bad it might as well have been written by an e-voting lobbyist. For me, it calls the good faith of the entire bill into question. Anybody who thinks this bill advances the cause of paper ballots in any way is a fool gravely mistaken.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.

Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the OPEC member. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hopes Maduro and those supported by his ""corruption and his brutality"" will leave Venezuela peacefully.

""We make clear to them that we will support the interim president's call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,"" Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere, and our message today very much was intended to say - to Mexico, to Uruguay, to nations across the eastern Caribbean - that they need to come off the sidelines, they need to take a stand for freedom. Stand with us and with the people of Venezuela,"" said Pence.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup against Venezuela.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

That day, a robotic-looking Trudeau told reporters “the allegations in the Globe story this morning are false.”

“Neither the current nor the previous attorney general was ever directed by me nor anyone in my office to take a decision in this matter.”

Yesterday, in testimony before the House justice committee, the clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, attacked the original Globe story, saying it “contained errors, unfounded speculation and in some cases [was] simply defamatory.”

He then confirmed its central assertion, that Wilson Raybould had in fact been pressed to stop the corruption prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

He said that on Dec. 19, he spoke to her about the case. “I conveyed to her that a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company, the options that were being openly discussed in the business press about the company moving or closing.”

So the Globe was right, of course. She was pressured—by Wernick, by Trudeau and by his right hand man, Gerry Butts—to overturn the decision of the independent director of public prosecutions, who had concluded that there was no basis to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Wernick said that was not “inappropriate pressure,” that all the talk was “lawful advocacy,” but he would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s the one who applied the pressure. He can hardly now say that it was inappropriate to do so.

The legislation allows for the justice minister to overturn the independent decision of the director of public prosecutions, but to do so she would have had to declare it in the Canada Gazette, publicly undercutting the prosecutor, which might have led to a high-profile resignation, throwing the administration of justice into disrepute.

One of the surprising things about this whole mess is how many well-educated, powerful, astute people thought it was appropriate to put the muscle on Wilson-Raybould to push for a result that would have made all of them look bad.

It seems like they fell prey to groupthink, influenced by the high-priced and effective lobbyists. Note that the chairman of SNC-Lavalin’s board is Kevin Lynch, who held Wernick’s job under Harper. The Laurentian elite had convinced itself that SNC-Lavalin should not be allowed to fail.

I suspect the Prime Minister’s aides did not look closely enough at the law, or were distracted by the pressure to pick up seats in Quebec, which Trudeau needs if he is to win another majority. Premier Francois Legault was pressing Trudeau to come up with a way to save the company, reasonably enough, and Trudeau would dearly like to have Legault’s help in the coming election, in which he is likely to face hostile premiers in Ontario and Alberta.

Trudeau is not a details guy, so he likely asked Wernick and Butts to make this happen. They should have said, “Sorry, boss. That dog won’t hunt. Can we give Legault something on immigration?” Instead, it looks like, they said: “Let me talk to her, see if I can convince her.”

Then, when she wouldn’t come around, they should have said, “You know what, Jody, you were right. Good call.”

Instead, they said: “We are really looking forward to you bringing your skills to play at Veterans Affairs.”

Then came the Globe story, anonymous attacks on Wilson-Raybould from a senior Liberal, the resignation of Wilson-Raybould, the resignation of senior Liberal Butts, a weird cabinet meeting where Wilson-Raybould got to tell her colleagues about the inappropriate pressure and, finally, yesterday, Wernick’s appearance, where he confirmed the original Globe story.

It was a surprising turn of events, not because of what he had to say about the arm-twisting he engaged in, but because of the vivid observations he made about many other things.

Clerks of the privy council usually stay backstage. Because the Liberals have made a hash of this whole thing, communicating excessively and ineffectively without ever confronting the heart of the matter, Wernick had to deliver a soliloquy, doing work that Trudeau should have done.

It was the performance of a lifetime—powerful, emotional and effective—warning against foreign interference in our elections, violent political rhetoric and disrespect for the wise people, like him, for instance, who are running our government.

Wernick, whose back was to the wall, succeeded in producing headlines that had nothing to do with the matter at hand, and asserted—effectively but unconvincingly—that everything he and everybody else did to pressure Wilson-Raybould was appropriate.

I don’t think most law professors would agree with him, but law professors in general prefer the Trudeau government to the alternative, and are unlikely to rally against Trudeau the way they rallied against Stephen Harper when he tangled with Beverley McLachlin.

Wernick succeeded in spinning this mess, throwing up chaff and providing an explanation that people can buy if they are inclined to do so. This will make him a polarizing figure—since he praised Liberals and attacked Conservatives—which is not ideal, but the Liberals were desperate.

Wilson-Raybould will speak next week, and she may yet deliver a damaging blow, but for the first time since the Globe dropped its story, it looks like there may be a way for the Liberals to turn this from a preoccupying crisis to one difficult file among many.

This affair raises serious questions about the competence and judgment of Trudeau’s operation, but there are no indications that anyone was acting to pursue corrupt ends, and the Liberals have time to make a proposition to voters on other matters, if they have the competence and judgment necessary.

The post H1B spouses’ H4 work permits are being walked off the cli…,"New York: The Donald Trump government’s process of slow-walking H1B spouses' H4 visa work permit off the cliff is on its last mile and anxiety is peaking across the community of H1B spouses in the United States. The proposed rule to do away with H4 work permits (which came into effect in Barack Obama's second term) was sent to the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review last week. Headlines like ""Game over for H4EAD"" are floating around as families are torn between decisions about work and life in the US and the endless skewering.

""The squeeze is real and it's very effective from the administration's point of view. H1B extensions are getting very hard. Our families are getting hit. Spouses are upset that they may be denied working rights and to top to all, recruiters are going cold when they hear the word H1B. It's coming at us from all sides and frankly, we can't take it any more"", an ex-H1B worker who has moved to Canada barely a month ago, told Firstpost, in a phone conversation.

The H4 EAD is a work permit for spouses of H1B workers who have been approved for green cards and are yet to get those in hand. The Trump administration first announced its intent to scrap the H4 EAD in early 2017. The pushback against these work permits predates the Trump era and takes the form of a lawsuit launched against the program within days of its announcement by the Barack Obama government in 2015.

Charts extrapolating how quickly or slowly the H4 revocation could happen speak to the many pressures working on legal immigrant spouses over a prolonged period of many years now of which the last 2 years have been the most fraught.

""Let’s do everything collectively in our power to prevent the revocation of H-4 EAD"", says Cyrus Mehta, a high name recognition immigration attorney based in New York.

In government filings, the proposed changes are listed as “economically significant” and with “international impact”. At least 45% of all pending rule changes are in the “proposed rule” stage. You can see the high level overview here. If OMB moves at top speed and wraps up comments period within 30 days, we are looking at Spring 2019 when the comments review may begin. On the same sliding scale, a slower pace could push it all out by a few months. Either way, a constant gnawing remains for H1B families.

Once OMB reviews the proposed rule, it will be published in the Federal Register and opened for comments - the typical rubric for rule changes. Those who are following this can check for DHS pending rules and look for 1615-AC15. The same link also summarises the 'official' DHS lens on the issue.

Framed against the backdrop of the wider political scene in the country, the brief history of the H4 EAD in the Trump era fits neatly within the US president’s all-base, all-the-time strategy. But, like anything else, the White House’s chief occupant is the final wild card in this game and could always (in theory) step off the gas at any time. The motivations to soften the blow could come from multiple flanks and are emergent in nature, not all of which are overt at this moment.

At this time, the biggest of the #MAGA themed decisions - Trump's emergency declaration - is also on thin ice. Nearly two dozen former Republican members of Congress are urging GOP lawmakers to reject President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Whichever way that goes, it's an anthem for shifting sands and chaos well into the 2020 campaign season and all the way till the November 2020 elections.

Anirban Das, who came to the US on an F1 student visa to study for an Engineering Master's degree and has been a leading advocate for skilled immigrants here, explains how the numbers stack up, in a tweet: “As per USCIS stats, 100k #H4EAD are issued, out of which 30k were renewals. Which means only 70K are original applicants. USCIS has no idea how many are ACTUALLY working. US labor force is approx. 155 million. And they want to pull out 70k people from the workforce?”

This is how DHS explains the upside for citizens: “DHS anticipates that there would be two primary impacts that DHS can estimate and quantify: the cost-savings accruing to forgone future filings by certain H-4 dependent spouses, and labor turnover costs that employers of H-4 workers could incur when their employees’ EADs are terminated. Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold, as the proposed rule would no longer allow H-4 workers to enter the labor market early.”

Das, quoted above, refutes that idea as a “lump of labor” theory. ""USCIS claims #H4EAD takes away American jobs. If an #H4EAD takes a job, it means a corresponding job loss for a citizen. This is ""lump of labor"" fallacy. No. of jobs in US economy are not set in stone. Studies show when more people join workforce, more jobs are created"".

Prominent US politicians have been at the forefront of the pushback; now even more so. Kamala Harris, the Indian American running for 2020 has called the effort “outrageous”. She tweeted that it “will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this.”

Officials are silent on the fine print. What wasn’t clear earlier remains that way. We don’t know whether the proposed rule change will have retrospective effect or not. If say, an H1B spouse has an H4 EAD that is stamped till 2021 and the rule changes this year, does it mean the H4EAD holder must stop work for pay immediately? The lion’s share of H4 EADs are held by Indians, mostly women. A small percentage of H4 visa holders are men.

The closest we have come to an official/ bureaucratic view on this are USCIS chief Francis Cissna's quotes to Bloomberg Law. Cissna said there are “very good reasons why you might want to have H-1B spouses be able to work,” and that many of those spouses are “very highly skilled.” “If the spouse can’t work, that might prevent that person from wanting to come over or stay,” but that’s something Congress should fix, he told reporter Laura D Francis.

“The reason why we’re proposing rescinding it is not because we don’t desire these people to have employment authorization...It’s because, amongst other reasons, it doesn’t appear to have been the intent of Congress to grant them work authorization,” Cissna said, in the same Bloomberg interview.

The replies on this Twitter thread below give us a good sense of how many directions the H4 or even the H1B debate can take when it goes beyond the legal framework and instead becomes a flashpoint between a dominant group and a new subculture that gains currency in an economy, like the H1B has come to be understood over three decades of its presence in the US.

The citizens of Caracas face unpleasant choices.

What’s Next for Venezuela?

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.",What’s Next for Venezuela?,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/next-venezuela-144400468.html

Trump announced his decision in a pair of tweets, praising Craft's credentials for the job.

""I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations...,"" Trump wrote.

""Kelly has done an outstanding job representing our nation and I have no doubt that, under her leadership, our country will be represented at the highest level. Congratulations to Kelly and her entire family!""

Craft is the wife of billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they are major Republican donors. She made headlines as Canada ambassador nominee when she said she believes in ""both sides"" of climate science.

""I think that both sides have their own results, from their studies, and I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science,"" Craft told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2017.

Craft's nomination is yet to be approved by the US Senate. If selected, she will not hold a Cabinet-level position, as it has been downgraded by President Trump.

According to Reuters news agency, Craft held meetings with Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton on Friday at the Oval Office.

Secretary Pompeo described Craft as an ""outstanding advocate for America's national security and economic interests in Canada"" and ""extremely well-qualified"" for the UN ambassador job.

Challenges for Craft

Craft was not Trump's first choice for the UN post; he had planned to nominate former State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, but she withdrew her name from consideration last week, citing family reasons.

Trump had also considered US ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former Senate candidate from Michigan John James for the UN role.

Craft, a Republican donor from Kentucky, served as a member of the US delegation to the UN General Assembly under President George W. Bush's administration.

As US ambassador to Canada, Craft played a key role in negotiating the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

If confirmed to the new post, Craft is likely to face a number of challenges, including containing Iran's influence in the Middle East and mending ties with the European Union.

Francois DeLattre, France's UN ambassador, said she looks forward to working with Craft. ""I hope that Ms. Craft will continue, like Nikki Haley, to be a bridge between Washington and the UN at a time when we more than ever need an America that is engages with the UN in world affairs and committed to our shared values, beginning with human rights,"" she said.

Recent reports from Microsoft revealed that the attackers are focusing specifically on electoral integrity, public policy and democracy groups.

AccountGuard cybersecurity service will enter 12 new European markets including Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania. Estonia, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Spain and Portugal.

As compared to the past, now users are more aware of the domestic and international electoral malfeasance and cyber attacks that are targeting users all over the world.

The tech giant has included around 14 countries from Europe along with the US and Canada in the Defending Democracy Program as of February 20th.

AccountGuard’s main features

The tool offers a handful of important features such as training and briefings on the latest trends, detection of threats across various email addresses and accounts.

Furthermore, large enterprise and government customers can enjoy early access to the latest security features offered by Microsoft. Few of them are enabling two-factor authentication, implementing access controls and installing updates.

AccountGuard has gained huge popularity in a short span of time, following its release last year. It is available to the users in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Ireland. Office 365 users can use it free of cost.

Microsoft also revealed that the service would be available to other European countries in the next few months.

In case you want to be secure while surfing the internet, you will need to get a full-dedicated tool to secure your network. Install now Cyberghost VPN and secure yourself. It protects your PC from attacks while browsing, masks your IP address and blocks all unwanted access.

Attackers made their first move

As we all know, the 2017 French Presidential Elections were reportedly influenced by cyber attacks. Moreover, European leaders are currently fearing that history is about to repeat itself. They might manipulate video and audio recording using ‘deep fake’ techniques.

The content is manipulated in a way that makes someone says something that he/she has never said or done before.

It seems like hackers have already made their first move as they tried to access 104 accounts that belong to users from different democratic institutions. These users are mainly located in France, Belgium, Serbia, Germany, Romania, and Poland.

As a matter of fact, Microsoft is aiming to protect customers and secure their systems by notifying the organizations regarding recent attempts.

The attackers followed the same technique that was used last year during U.S. mid-terms. They spoofed legitimate looking email addresses and created malicious URLs in order to get access to employee credentials and inject malware.

However, it is just a matter of time to see the history repeat itself. Do you see that prediction turning in to reality?

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.

America’s largest Israel advocacy organizations issued an extraordinary rebuke of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Friday, responding to his move to ally with an extremist party under intense political pressure ahead of the April 9 election.



On Wednesday, Netanyahu supported an agreement between Bayit Yehudi and Otzma Yehudit, an offshoot of a racist political movement that has been designated a terrorist organization abroad and banned from Knesset lists since the 1980s.

The move could see Otzma in the Knesset for the first time and, conceivably, in a governing coalition.The American Jewish Committee vacillated over whether to comment on the unusual development, but ultimately chose to speak out on Friday. “The views of Otzma Yehudit are reprehensible,” the organization said. “They do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel.”Looking ahead to the elections, the group continued, “AJC reaffirms our commitment to Israel’s democratic and Jewish character, which we hope will be the ultimate winners in every election cycle.”Equally unusual was the decision by AIPAC to endorse AJC’s statement in full by retweet.“We agree with AJC,” the American Israel Public Affairs Committee stated. “AIPAC has a long-standing policy not to meet with members of this racist and reprehensible party.”The Kahanist movement, founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, considers Arabs and other non-Jews in Israel to be enemies of the state, and supports replacing Israel’s democratic government with a theocratic structure.Several different groups have spawned from Kahane’s racist ideology. Some have outwardly promoted violence, while others have stopped short of publicly proclaiming policies that would get them banned from sitting in the Knesset.Otzma falls in the latter category. It has taken a similar strategic approach to the stigma of Kahanist history that neo-fascist groups have navigated in the US and Europe, rebranding as an “alt-right” political movement tonally distinct and subtler than its predecessors.Kahane served in the Knesset for only one term, but his influence has carried long after his tenure and assassination in 1990. He advocated the annexation of Gaza and the West Bank, restoring Jewish “sovereignty” over the Temple Mount, limiting the rights of non-Jews to a subclass – or even forcibly “transferring” them from the country – and violence against his political enemies.Today, Otzma Yehudit supports several of these policies, including full Israeli control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea and cancellation of the Oslo Accords. Party leaders have shied away from calls to violence and mass deportations, but support the forced expulsion of “Arab extremists,” avoiding specifics.Kahane was personally accused of plotting various terrorist attacks throughout the 1970s, and his followers continue to face accusations of supporting domestic terrorism and incitement to racism. A massacre of 29 Palestinian Muslims praying at Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs in 1994, perpetrated by followers of Kahane, led Israel, the US, Canada and the EU to designate Kahane’s Kach group as a terrorist entity.Netanyahu, who will address AIPAC’s policy conference next month, made a point of not responding to criticism from American Jewish leaders. But he did respond to criticism from the Blue and White Party and other political opponents, who he accused of “a hypocritical double-standard.”“It is absurd that they rule out encouraging mergers on the Right but consider it legitimate to ensure that inciters and spies against Israel enter the Knesset,” Netanyahu said.He was referring to votes by Labor and Meretz in the Central Elections Committee to permit then-Balad leader Azmi Bishara to run for Knesset. He later became the subject of a criminal investigation for acts of alleged treason and espionage, and was suspected of supplying information to Hezbollah on strategic areas in Israel to attack with rockets. Bishara was subsequently stripped of his Knesset immunity, and fled to Qatar.Netanyahu also noted that in 1999, then-candidate for prime minister Ehud Barak participated in the same rally as Northern Islamic Movement head Sheikh Raed Salah, who was later convicted of incitement.Blue and White’s prime ministerial candidate Benny Gantz said, “The rare statement issued by AIPAC, an organization which seldom deals with internal Israeli politics, proves that Netanyahu has yet again crossed an ethical boundary in an attempt to hold on to his seat while severely damaging the Israeli spirit, Jewish morals, and our important relationship with US Jewry.”Gantz’s partner in Blue and White, Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter that “Netanyahu caused huge damage to Israel’s image in the world and is wiling to endanger our democracy.” He added that “when our closest friends feel they must condemn us, it is clear to everyone that a redline has been crossed.”Labor faction chairman Itzik Shmuli thanked AIPAC and AJC for taking a stand against Otzma Yehudi and “telling Netanyahu that he cannot get away with everything that helps his battle for political and legal survival, but harms our national interests.”Otzma Yehudi responded that AIPAC members should move to Israel and “come home before interfering in the election.”“They don’t live here, and they criticize us, as if they are on Mount Olympus,” Otzma Yehudit Knesset candidate Michael Ben-Ari told KAN, adding that there was no reason for the Jewish organizations to criticize Netanyahu, because their running with Bayit Yehudi was merely technical, and after the election, they will split into a separate faction.“I won’t be part of Netanyahu’s coalition if he continues his current path,” Ben-Ari said.

Violence erupted at the Venezuela-Colombia border over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, killing four people and injuring 24 on Feb. 22.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that his “days are numbered,” and Trump officials reiterated that the U.S. is considering all options, including military action, to address Venezuela’s crisis.

Almost 80 percent of Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro, who was reinaugurated for a second six-year term in January after an election widely seen as fraudulent. Since taking power in 2013, he has led Venezuela into a deep economic crisis.

In late January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a “usurper” and swore himself in as the country’s rightful president. More than 50 countries – including the United States, Europe and most of Latin America – want to replace Maduro’s regime with a Guaidó-led government.

Despite near global condemnation of Maduro, any U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be controversial. The United States’ long history of interfering in Latin American politics suggests that its military operations generally usher in dictatorship and civil war – not democracy.

The Cuban-US Cold War

Cuba, the focus of my history research, is a prime example of this pattern.

U.S.-Cuban relations have never recovered from President William McKinley’s intervention in Cuba’s war for independence over a century ago.

Before waging what in the U.S. is known as the Spanish-American War in 1898, McKinley promised that “the people of the island of Cuba” would be “free and independent” from Spain and that his government had no “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said Island.”

In the end, however, Cuba’s independence from Spain meant domination by the United States.

For 60 years after the Spanish-American War, the White House made repeated military and diplomatic interventions in Cuba, supporting politicians who protected U.S. economic interests in sugar, utilities, banks or tourism and who backed American foreign policy in the Caribbean.

By 1952, when the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista overthrew President Carlos Prío Socarrás, Cuba’s government had effectively become protectors of American businesses, according to my research. Batista had a warm relationship with both Washington, D.C. and the American organized crime groups that used to control Havana’s tourist industry.

A communist revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew Batista’s military junta in 1959. Castro decried the “imperialist government of the United States” for turning Cuba into an “American colony.”

The Kennedy administration’s trade embargo against Cuba and the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion – in which the U.S. military trained Cuban dissidents in an attempt to unseat Castro – only pushed Cuba further into the orbit of Soviet Russia.

For the past six decades, the U.S. and Cuba have remained locked in a Cold War, with a brief thaw under President Barack Obama.

Anti-communist coups

Fearing that communism would spread across the hemisphere, the U.S. government repeatedly interfered in the politics of Latin American nations during the Cold War.

In 1954 the CIA worked with elements of the Guatemalan military to overthrow elected President Jacobo Árbenz, whom U.S. policymakers considered dangerously left-wing. Decades of dictatorship and civil war followed, killing an estimated 200,000 people.

A peace agreement in 1996 restored democracy, but Guatemala has yet to recover economically, politically or psychologically from the bloodshed.

Then there is Chile’s U.S.-supported coup d'etat. In 1973, the U.S. government covertly assisted right-wing elements of the Chilean military in overthrowing the socialist president Salvador Allende.

General Augusto Pinochet took power with the quiet financial and political support of the United States. His dictatorship, which lasted until 1990, killed tens of thousands of Chileans.

The Dominican Republic and Panama

U.S. intervention in Latin America did not start or end with the Cold War.

During World War I, the United States was concerned that Germany could use the Dominican Republic as a base of military operations. So American troops occupied the Caribbean island from 1916 to 1924.

Though the American-led administration improved the finances and infrastructure of the Dominican Republic, it also created the national guard that helped to propel Gen. Rafael Trujillo into power. His 30-year reign was savage.

President George H. W. Bush’s 1989 invasion of Panama is the rare exception when U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs actually created stability.

Most Panamanians appear to have supported the 1989 U.S. military operation to remove the corrupt and brutal military strongman Manuel Noriega.

In the years since, Panama has enjoyed comparatively peaceful elections and transfers of power.

Anti-Americanism in Latin America

On balance, though, U.S. military operations in Latin America have rarely brought democracy.

But they have created strong anti-American sentiment in the region, which leftist leaders from Fidel Castro to Hugo Chávez have adeptly harnessed to vilify their political opponents as mere U.S. puppets.

Support for the U.S. government is lower now than it has been in decades. Just 35 percent of Argentines, 39 percent of Chileans and 45 percent of Venezuelans view the U.S. favorably, according to the Pew Research Center.

President Maduro, too, has used anti-imperialist rhetoric. He denounces U.S. sanctions and other efforts to isolate his regime as a “gringo plot.”

A safer way to restore democracy

This history explains why a U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be viewed with skepticism. Though Maduro is unpopular, 65 percent of Venezuelans oppose any foreign military operation to remove Maduro, according to recent polling.

Rather than plan yet another coup d'etat, I believe U.S. efforts in Venezuela should support the work of the Lima Group, a coalition of 12 Latin American countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, plus Canada.

The Lima Group has ruled out military force in Venezuela. Its pressure campaign to force him out peacefully has included diplomatically isolating his regime and asking Venezuela’s soldiers to pledge loyalty to Guaidó.

A negotiated settlement leading to Maduro’s voluntary departure from office is their ultimate goal.

Regional diplomacy is much slower than foreign intervention. But it avoids further bloodshed and reduces the role of anti-Americanism in Venezuela’s crisis.

48,Empty,2019-02-22T06:00:00Z,The aging socialist Demcratic presidential candidate got a softball MSNBC interviewer asking him about Venezuela and all he could utter was boilerplate dreck to try to deflect the questions.,"An MSNBC interviewer, captured on video by The Right Scoop, gave him just that opportunity, as you can see from this screen shot here :

Bernie Sanders, 77, who's been defending socialist Venezuela for years, and who'd now like to be our president, has some explaining to do.

Bernie blew it.

MSNBC's Chris Hayes: What is the Bernie Sanders case for why Venezuela is the way it is? What went wrong there in what was an avowedly socialist project? Bernie Sanders: Ahhh, well. I mean, that's a long story that we can't, I don't think we have the time to get into.

Bernie Sanders, continuing: But this is what I will say: And that is, that I think there must be free and fair elections, in Venezuela, the last elections were not free, second of all, we have got to do everything that we can to provide humanitarian aid along with other countries, so the people do not starve to death, and thirdly, we need to make certain that the United States does not do what it has done, time and time again in our history, and that is, get involved in overthrowing governments in Latin America. We did that in Chile, we did that in Brazil, Guatemala, other countries, we should not be doing that now. The future of Venezuela must rest with the Venezuelan people, not the Trump administration.

This didn't seem to impress even the far-left softball Hayes all that much.

Here's the problem. Venezuela's crisis is very much a crisis of socialism. When you expand the state as much as Venezuela did, as rapidly as Venezuela did in the past decade, the private sector dies. That's not even with all of the expropriations of private property; just the expansion of the state is enough to do it, as Tyler Cowen argues in this seminal essay here.

If we look at government spending as a percentage of GDP, Venezuela seems far from socialism. In recent years government spending in Venezuela has been measured at about 40 percent of GDP, with the caveat that these statistics are not fully reliable. For the U.S., the corresponding figure is about 37 percent. Yet emerging economies typically cannot afford the same government programs as wealthier countries, and they cannot run them with the same efficacy. Poorer countries that try to expand their governments to size of wealthier countries, such as Brazil and Venezuela, typically encounter sub-par economic performance. These are indeed stories of big government run amok, as some of conservatives are suggesting.

Blowing out the private sector through price controls and currency controls, all in the name of ""fairness,"" is a pretty good way to leave just oil as the only money game in town as an unintended (or, given that these are socialists at war with the ""greedy"" private sector, intended) consequence of socialism writ large.

Socialist central planning from the state, in that government-knows-best way of Bernie Sanders and all his socialist allies, is another way to Venezuelify a nation through socialism. In 2003, Venezuela's strongman Hugo Chávez, following his Cowen-described creation of conditions for the destruction of the private sector through the expansion of government, nevertheless still had the state oil industry as his money source to ensure his permanent power, which he justified as ""la revolución."" Instead of guarding the oil like Gollum's ring, which would have required free-market business practices, he fired all the oil experts and replaced them with politically connected cronies chosen for their socialism and then spent the oil company's earnings on welfare instead of operational investment, as a normal company would do.

That's a really good way to run out of other people's money.

Is Bernie Sanders saying he'd never dream of doing any such things in the name of ""fairness"" or ""ending greed"" or ""the people""?

Of course not. That's why he can't answer the question.

What's more, Sanders's last statements are a mishmash of true and false premises, which make the rest of his response inchoate.

He starts out almost sounding good by saying he wants free and fair elections in Venezuela, just as Venezuela's acting president, Juan Guaidó, fighting to boot the socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro, has called for. Fine and dandy, but Sanders forgets to mention that socialism — a monopoly of cronies, red-shirted socialist thugs forcing government workers and the slum-dwellers to vote a certain way, or else no job or ration card, and a rigged electronic voting system from an electoral board run by socialist cronies that could check who voted for whom was precisely why those elections were so unfair. Socialism takes socialists, and sure enough, it was socialists who made Venezuela's election unfair.

Then he says he wants Venezuelans to be fed, the very thing socialism always promises in its propaganda dating from the Bolsheviks. ""Peace, land, bread,"" right, Bernie? He wants them fed, but there's a problem: the socialist dictator of the place doesn't want them fed, which is why he's blocking aid convoys of massive shipments from the U.S., Brazil, Chile, Canada, and many other countries' shipments on his southern and eastern frontiers, ordering Venezuelan troops to enforce its non-entry. Sanders conveniently leaves out the sorry socialist detail that brings up the uncomfortable fact that socialism has always used food — and starvation — as a weapon to ensure socialist power. No acknowledgment of that one from Bernie. He also leaves out the uncomfortable fact that President Guaidó has asked for it from nations abroad. Sanders seems to want them fed but refuses to admit why they're not being fed.

Then we get to the worst of his drivel, which, by the way, is boilerplate repetition from one of his last strings of tweets three weeks earlier — the guy doesn't come up with many new ideas. Sanders argues that the real danger in Venezuela is U.S. intervention, not starving people. If someone has to starve so the U.S. doesn't intervene, he's obviously all in, because Trump's brandished weapon, aid, can't be allowed in if a socialist government says ""no."" His argument that the U.S. must not be overthrowing governments, which he seems to think is the problem here, not socialism itself, is incredibly insulting to the millions and millions of Venezuelans marching and protesting to take back their democracy. President Trump so far has only offered food as President Guaidó asked, and here Bernie is, yelling about U.S. intervention, same as Maduro.

Sanders's inability to explain himself on socialism, as well as his effort to thwart Trump and discredit the U.S. as the ""real"" problem in that hellhole, is nothing but a bid to deflect the question on socialism. It's dishonest, and it suggests that Bernie has a problem, promoting socialism for the U.S. at a time when socialism's result is there for all to see in the nightmare of Venezuela. One can only wonder why he's running at such a time. Some have speculated that he's running because he wants to draw in more money for goodies for himself. His inability to issue any robust defense of his socialism, his past support for Venezuela's socialist regime, or the will of the Venezuelan people pretty much supports that theory. He's in it for the dough.

“Natural born citizens are naturally citizens because they have only ONE nationality and cannot possibly be anything else.” Not exactly. It is REAL easy to understand. A “natural born citizen” means... Born in the country by TWO citizen parentS. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. Article XII (the last sentence) “But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” SIMPLE.

""Softwood lumber wasn't something that was being discussed a lot,"" Higgs told reporters when he landed at the Fredericton airport on Monday after three days in the U.S. capital.

The winter meeting of the governors takes place with hundreds of guests, including leaders from business, non-profits and governments around the world.

Before Higgs left for the meeting, he said he would be willing to give way on the province's forestry policy to help ease some of the punishing tariffs on softwood lumber coming from New Brunswick.

New Brunswick was the only Atlantic province not exempt from softwood lumber tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

Support closer to home

While softwood lumber tariffs were not high on the radar of most people at the Washington meeting, the New England governors were more receptive to the province's plight, Higgs said.

He singled out Janet Mills, the Democratic governor of Maine, who assumed office after last year's mid-term elections.

""She recognizes the sensitivities on both sides of the border,"" said Higgs.

This is what else Premier Blaine Higgs had to say to reporters after his return from Washington on Monday. 0:59

He said the lumber industry in Maine and New Brunswick are heavily integrated and there's a lot of trade between them.

""We as Atlantic Canada, and the eastern U.S., you know kind of always had a market and a business here that needs to be protected.""

National focus needed

Higgs said he felt the issue has now been raised but he wished Canadians at the Washington meetings had come up with a more national focus for the issue.

""I think B.C. has the large portion of the business, and so it's getting more of a focus and we're being drug into it,"" said Higgs.

In Washington, Higgs planned to meet with David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada and now a lobbyist being paid $40,000 a month by the province to lobby the Trump administration on softwood lumber tariffs.

Higgs said he would decide after meeting with Wilkins whether the province would keep him on, but after returning didn't commit to Wilkins one way or the other.

""[Wilkins] was very helpful, he gave me good information,"" Higgs said.

""He offered obviously to continue his assistance in that regard. I said 'We'll talk more about that.'""",Higgs's softwood lumber pitch falls on indifferent ears in U.S.,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-returns-from-washington-1.5032579

The widespread hunger, sky-high inflation, rampant crime, and acute shortages that have hit the country hard over the past three years have started to poke holes in many Venezuelans’ once unbreakable faith in the government.","Valeria Palacio lives in a space dominated by former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Her run-down apartment has a Chávez portrait painted on the living room wall and a little statue of the late socialist leader placed on a shrinelike coffee table, surrounded by his books and even a replica of his iconic red beret.

But there is no sign of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez’s handpicked successor. “Venezuela is broken. Maduro has done poorly,” says Ms. Palacio, who works as a supermarket vendor.

The widespread hunger, sky-high inflation, rampant crime, and acute shortages that have hit the country hard over the past three years have started to poke holes in many Venezuelans’ once unbreakable faith in the government. Maduro was supposed to be a “steward” safeguarding Chávez’s revolution, but instead, Palacio says, he’s “destroying” it.

Recommended: Can Canada lead on Latin America? Venezuela poses a test.

Yet she still supports him.

The former leader pulled millions of Venezuelans out of poverty and delivered government programs to some of the most ignored portions of the population, thanks to soaring oil prices. Palacio says she can’t let go of her hope that his revolutionary model will once again flourish. “If the revolution [ceases to exist] I would lose my soul,” she says. “This is about the Chavista way of life.”

Palacio isn’t alone in her struggle to square her passionate support for Chávez’s “21st Century Socialism” with a crumbling economy and bland but iron-fisted leader.

On Jan. 23, National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó declared that Maduro’s most recent election was invalid, making Mr. Guaidó himself the nation’s interim president until a fresh vote can be held. Since then, the newly invigorated opposition has gained momentum, posing the biggest challenge so far to Maduro’s increasingly authoritarian government. Amid the visible growth in suffering across Venezuela, with an estimated 3 million fleeing over the past three years, some Chavistas – as supporters of Chávez’s political project are known – are starting to question some of their political beliefs and who represents them.

It’s a key moment of reckoning for Venezuela. Support for Maduro has dipped under 20 percent, according to Caracas-based pollster Datanálisis, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the majority of Chavistas back the opposition. If Chavistas renounce Maduro, the opposition’s chances of taking the nation in a new direction increase. But to win them over, the opposition has to appeal to those like Palacio: Venezuelans who still venerate Chávez and his plans for the revolution despite the disappointments of his successor.

“Maduro and Chavismo are two different things. Maduro’s approval rating has been around 20 percent for the last three years while the popularity of Chávez and his revolutionary legacy have been slightly over 50 percent steadily,” says Luis Vicente León, a political analyst and director of Datanálisis.

‘LOYAL ALWAYS’

Guaidó is starting to make inroads among Maduro fans and Chavistas alike. He’s also appealed to constituents who say they didn’t feel a connection to any existing leadership option – in the opposition or otherwise.

“Guaidó has now a majority of Venezuelans behind him, roughly over 50 percent,” says Mr. León.

However, Chavistas still fill up the streets of Venezuelan towns in their signature red shirts, proclaiming steadfast support for the Maduro government. People of all ages gather at rallies alongside a striking presence of uniformed soldiers. Supporters dance, sing, and call out in unison slogans like “Loyal always, traitors never!”

Pro-government demonstrators keep showing up for different reasons. Some say they support Maduro purely out of pragmatism: Despite acute shortages of basic food and medical products, the government still gives supporters handouts. Some 5.7 million people still receive food subsidies, according to government figures, and others have free housing or modest financial support. That could all disappear if Maduro falls.

“The government is the people. They care about us. The opposition is only interested in power and money,” says a Chavista who introduced himself by a pseudonym, Armandio, at a recent rally in downtown Caracas.","In Venezuela, support for Maduro is about more than the man in charge",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-support-maduro-more-man-charge-131800395.html

Vice presi…","The US has announced new sanctions on Caracas and insisted that all options were on the table to oust Nicolas Maduro, as a Republican senator tweeted images showing the death throes of Muammar Gaddafi in an apparent threat to the Venezuelan leader.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.





Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.",US announces new Venezuela sanctions as Rubio shares 'snuff movie' pictures of Colonel Gaddafi in threat to Maduro,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-announces-venezuela-sanctions-rubio-204529328.html

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢 — Eric Goldman (@ericgoldman) June 29, 2018



If you can’t read it:

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢

This broad dynamic in Internet law didn’t make my top 10 list explicitly (though FOSTA, GDPR and CCPA all rank highly), but it’s a sign of 2018’s historical significance.

#10: Politicians blocking constituents on social media. Politicians love the unfiltered broadcast capability of social media, but some of them hate getting unfiltered constituent feedback. So politicians keep blocking their constituents on social media, and courts keep declaring the blocks unconstitutional. If your job is to represent constituents that you don’t actually want to hear from, find a new line of work.

#9: Competitive keyword lawsuits are stupid…and possibly illegal. Each year I want to declare this topic dead, only to find it keeps cropping up again. Perhaps 2018 will drive the final nail in the coffin due to the FTC’s determination that 1-800 Contacts engaged in anti-competitive practices by systematically restricting its competitors’ ability to bid on its trademarks. Lawsuits over competitive keyword advertising have always been a bad business decision. Now, they are also legally ill-advised.

#8: Internet taxes. In the South Dakota v. Wayfair case, the Supreme Court opened up the door to states taxing online sales by non-residents. If Congress doesn’t intervene, expect a taxation tsunami.

#7: Failure of the lawsuits claiming that social media services support terrorism. Social media providers are not liable for the fact that terrorists use their tools. Nine different courts have confirmed that.

#6: EU Copyright Directive. The EU Copyright Directive has had more dramatic twists than a soap opera. You know the cliche: the good-looking but perpetually self-destructive character who consistently makes poor choices that prompts the audience to scream at the screen, “NOOOO…don’t do it!”

It’s a slight overstatement to say that the EU Copyright Directive’s mandatory filter and link tax would be the death of the Internet. More accurately, the directive would likely only cause the death of the European Internet. The mandatory filter requirement would likely eliminate most user-generated content in Europe. In its place, Europe will actualize the dystopian counterfactual vision of the Internet from the 1990s, when many people expected the Internet to replicate the 1990s cable system, with a few large content owners broadcasting paywalled content to passive viewers. The Internet has evolved into something greater than that, but can it stay that way? Has Europe already planted enough regulatory seeds that the European Internet will inevitably devolve in a cable-style collection of a few large walled gardens, even if the EU Copyright Directive is defeated?

#5: USMCA and Internet Immunity. Section 230 has always been an idiosyncratic American thing, a natural extension of our idiosyncratic First Amendment. So it was remarkable that NAFTA 2.0, the USMCA, embraced Section 230 and exported its pro-free speech policy to Mexico and Canada. Though we’re years away (at best) from Canada or Mexico actually doing anything different, it’s a small glimmer of hope that a user-powered Internet might survive a little longer, even if only in the North American region.

#4: GDPR. The passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act implicitly burnished the GDPR’s reputation as a privacy regulation. As bad as the GDPR is—and it’s bad—the GDPR sometimes looks attractive when compared to the even-more-terrible CCPA. But let’s not over-romanticize the GDPR. It is unquestionably an innovation-killer. It raises significant entry barriers and imposes significant ongoing compliance costs. It ossifies the business environment and privileges existing incumbents over stifled start-ups. I expect we’ll see a steady stream of empirical studies confirming that dynamic. The GDPR has also accelerated the splinternet phenomenon, as businesses outside the EU “opt out” of the GPDR by blocking EU-based users, creating geographically divergent Internets–and realities.

#3: FOSTA. FOSTA is heart-breaking policy because it doesn’t appear to benefit anyone. In ways that were entirely predictable—and predicted—to Congress in advance, FOSTA appears to hurt, rather than help, sex trafficking victims and commercial sex workers, and it shrunk the Internet and undermined free speech. A truly sad outcome for everyone.

#2: California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the US, but it was produced by a terrible process that resulted in a predictably terrible law that will hurt the California economy and much more. It never ceases to amaze me how many California privacy lawyers really hate the law—even though they should be the law’s natural allies because they already survived GDPR compliance, plus the CCPA will benefit them financially. The CCPA won’t be fixed because the legislature doesn’t have the capacity or appetite to give it the necessary attention, and some privacy advocates have embraced the law despite its many flaws. Instead, the only remaining way to “fix” the CCPA is with a preemptive federal law, which shouldn’t give you much optimism given Congress’ dysfunction.

#1: Perceived online service bias against “conservatives.” In a “normal” year, the GDPR, FOSTA, and CCPA all would have been strong contenders for #1 on this list. But they were upstaged this year by an even more pernicious regulatory dynamic. Many conservatives believe that Internet services are “biased” against them, and they are fighting back vigorously on multiple fronts, including the courts, legislatures, and Trump’s Twitter timeline. Lawsuits in this genre include Mezey v. Twitter, Dehen v. Doe, Prager U v. Google, Brittain v. Twitter, and Kimbrell v. Twitter. Legislation in this genre include Arkansas Bill HB1028 and a federal bill from Rep. Gohmert, plus numerous confidence-undermining legislative hearings. The perceptions of anti-conservative bias are usually based on a combination of cherry-picked anecdotes and paranoia, so they are dangerously afactual. Furthermore, the Internet services are routinely asked to make sometimes-fine distinctions between “legitimate” “conservative” views that add to the discourse from “illegitimate” discriminatory hate speech that corrode the entire community and should be squelched. Yet, the pity-me persecution complex has the capacity to destroy the Internet. Internet services are already overreacting by treading more cautiously with respect to content that conservatives might support. It’s also accelerating support for legally requiring “neutrality” or “must carry” obligations, which would take away the Internet services’ ability to manage the crazies and thereby destroy the Internet. The Internet needs curation and filtration, but those efforts inevitably lead to accusations of “bias” by someone. We can’t let those accusations win.

Honorable mentions

* The Trump Administration’s terrible information security practices. Hillary Clinton’s alleged bad infosec practices were a signature and likely dispositive issue of the 2016 presidential elections. Yet, Trump and his affiliates have consistently appalling infosec practices, including the use of insecure email servers and insecure cellphones. It’s almost like Hillary was subjected to a double standard.

* End of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality has had nearly as many dramatic twists as the EU Copyright Directive. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I do know that telcos will act like monopolistic pigs if given the chance.

* Daniel v. Armslist. A goofy Wisconsin appellate ruling indicated that Section 230 only applied to defamation cases. The case is now pending before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. I hope they get it right.

* Spanski v TV Polska. One way of reading this case is that online publishers must use geoblocking if they want to avoid copyright liability in foreign countries. Another splinternets case.

* Fox v TVEyes. Copyright owners can shut down online archives if they don’t like being subject to critical scrutiny. A good example of how courts may underappreciate the value and complexity of content aggregation.

* ABS v. CBS. Remastering songs doesn’t reset copyright protection.

* Eichenwald v. Rivello. Perhaps the most interesting case of the year. Can software code sent over the Internet cause a battery? Maybe.

* Music Modernization Act. Most of it was inside baseball, but the law contains an interesting if limited attempt to statutorily accommodate orphan works.

* Goldman v. Breitbart. If this case stands, in-line linking may be doomed.

* Hassell v. Bird. A good Section 230 result rendered inscrutable by Justice Kruger’s swing-vote opinion.

55,Empty,2019-02-25T11:00:00Z,There’s a high level of optimism in all camps about Monday's federal byelection in which five candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new MP for the York-Simcoe riding.,"Monday's byelection in the York-Simcoe riding will see the People's Party of Canada (PPC) and Conservatives squaring off in a Tory-held riding for the very first time.

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Tanaka said she isn't worried about the SNC Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the prime minister.

""I am really focused on York-Simcoe, because that's where I'm running. And I'm not hearing it at the doors,"" she said.

""What I'm hearing at the doors [is] that it's hard to raise a family. I'm hearing at the doors that they are concerned about the health of Lake Simcoe,"" said Tanaka, adding that ""I want to be that voice in Ottawa.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she can be the voice of the local working class who are struggling. (Jessa McLean)

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she's the voice of the working class.

""We have a lot of precariously employed people,"" she said. ""Our job market is, either you're commuting [to the city] for a half decent paying job or you're staying here and earning very little.""

She's a community organizer in the region and a champion of the ""$15 and Fairness"" campaign to push the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

""Our housing rates have gone up the most in terms of Ontario,"" she said.

""Rentals are up 56 per cent while our wages are only up 11 per cent.""

People's Party of Canada debut

This byelection is also the PPC's debut at the polls, and an out-of-towner — ex-Toronto prosecutor Robert Geurts — is its candidate.

""The project right now is to get the word out. We are a national party,"" he said.

Robert Geurts of the People's Party of Canada says a lot of this campaign has to do with spreading the word of the new party's existence. (CBC News)

Ex-conservative MP Maxime Bernier founded the party after losing the federal Conservative leadership nod to Andrew Scheer.

""Scot Davidson has no plan really to change anything. He's going to stick to Mr. Scheer's plan,"" said Geurts, explaining their focus on courting millennial voters.

""That generation is so bright, and so exciting. [They] haven't been corrupted yet,"" he said.

""That's where I think Bernier has sort of said, 'Listen, our platform is unfinished because there's some really exciting things we can do if we don't burden ourselves with the old baggage of before.""'

Monday's byelection comes three months after municipal elections and six months before the federal election in October.

56,Empty,2019-02-23T20:40:04Z,"Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, delivered testimony to the House of Commons committee Thursday that largely backed the Liberal government’s account of the SNC-Lavalin affair.","Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, delivered remarkable testimony to the House of Commons justice committee Thursday, largely backing the Liberal government’s case about alleged pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

OTTAWA—Both the opposition Conservatives and New Democrats expressed qualified confidence in Canada’s top bureaucrat to sound the alarm about election interference after his unprecedented — and some suggest partisan — intervention in the SNC-Lavalin affair .

As the country’s top bureaucrat, the clerk of the privy council wields incredible power. They’re tasked with not only supporting the prime minister and cabinet in the day-to-day functions of government and receiving top-secret briefings, but also leading the greater public service in both its operations and its culture.

That is a serious claim that carries serious consequences.

Because his version of events matched up with the Trudeau government’s, and because he specifically called out a Conservative senator for adding to increasingly violent political rhetoric and praised a Liberal cabinet minister, some — including the Globe and Mail — have called Wernick’s testimony “partisan.”

Wernick, who has served in senior bureaucratic roles in both Conservative and Liberal administrations, has also been asked to lead a five-person committee tasked with informing Canadians if a hostile foreign power attempts to meddle in the 2019 campaign. While the committee includes the prime minister’s national security adviser, as well as senior officials in the Public Safety and Global Affairs departments, Wernick is the most senior official at the table.

But while it’s clear neither Conservative nor New Democrat MPs were pleased by Wernick’s intervention on Thursday, both parties told the Star they will accept his determination should he inform Canadians about foreign interference.

If the opposition believes him to be politically compromised, any pronouncement about foreign intervention would be immediately suspect. In other words, if the opposition parties accuse Wernick of supporting the Liberals, his sounding the alarm on election interference would be fatally compromised.

“We will accept it as legitimate, but we will be skeptical. And we will expect to be fully informed,” said Stephanie Kusie, the Conservatives’ democratic institutions critic and a former diplomat, in an interview Friday night.

“We will expect to have all of the information, insofar as it does not compromise national security, that the government had in making that decision as to it being a critical incident.

“Absolutely we will accept it as legitimate, but with great skepticism and with complete information.”

On Thursday, Wernick opened his testimony with a blunt warning to MPs.

“I’m deeply concerned about my country right now, and its politics, and where it’s headed,” Wernick said.

“I worry about foreign interference in the next election … I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassinations. I worry that somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the election campaign.”

Columnists and partisans were quick to point out that electoral interference, not to mention the possibility of political assassinations, was not a topic the committee was grappling with.

Instead, the committee was charged with investigating allegations, broadly untested and unconfirmed, that Trudeau’s staff attempted to interfere with Canada’s independent judicial system by pressuring Wilson-Raybould to offer SNC-Lavalin a “deferred prosecution agreement.” Such a deal would allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution in favour of restitution, and remain eligible to bid on federal government contracts.

Official Ottawa has been almost entirely consumed with the SNC-Lavalin affair since the Globe and Mail’s first story three weeks ago.

Wernick said Wilson-Raybould was “under pressure” to make the right decision, but denied any untoward pressure from Trudeau’s staff to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal.

“It is my conclusion and my assertion, based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter,” Wernick told the committee.

But after Wernick’s testimony, both in Ottawa and in the social media swamp, people accused the clerk of going to bat for the Liberals.

Nathan Cullen, the New Democrats’ ethics critic, said on Saturday the Liberals need to move quickly to address any suggestion the clerk is compromised when it comes to election interference. Cullen said the Liberals cannot ignore that people are raising the question of the clerk’s independence.

“I beg the Liberals: don’t ignore this, don’t pretend we’re not in a very important conversation that needs to be had,” Cullen said.

“People are having the conversation on the front page of national newspapers about the clerk’s independence. That is happening. Whether you think (columnists) are crazy, or you think this person is an anointed saint, it almost doesn’t matter now. It’s happening now, the neutrality is being discussed and questioned.

“And if that is the case, and you’ve created this new body, and the central actor is being questioned, then you need to do something about it,” Cullen said.

When the Star asked — yes or no — if Cullen and the New Democrats would accept Wernick’s determination that foreign actors were interfering with the 2019 election, Cullen said yes.

Cullen also said he believes the head of Elections Canada, Stéphane Perrault, should be involved in determining whether Canadians should be informed about electoral interference.

57,Empty,2019-02-23T17:00:00Z,"As the world’s biggest tech companies grow ever more massive and influential, there is a pressing need for the government to address the public’s concerns on issues such as privacy and taxation, without stifling innovation or turning away economic benefits.","The global tech-lash is growing. At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.

Barely a week goes by without some kind of tech scandal — whether it’s Amazon’s surprise Valentine’s Day decision to pull out of its planned New York City headquarters, or last week’s scathing report on disinformation and fake news from the U.K. Parliament that accuses companies like Facebook of behaving like “digital gangsters.”

Countries around the world are grappling with how to rein in the tech giants, particularly the so-called “Big Five” of Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Here’s a look at what they’re doing, and how Canada stacks up.

As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn’t completely caught up.

She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.

Practically it’s about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google’s Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.

“Personal control over the use of your data, when it’s disclosed, how it’s used. You should be the one in control,” says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school’s Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence

For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.

Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company’s own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments , fearing potential human rights abuses.

Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.

That’s because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.

“The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,” he says, referring to Facebook and Google.

“We are the product that they are selling.”

Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.

What others are doing:

In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 “consent decree,” that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.

But the “gold standard” for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.

The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company’s global revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.

Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there’s discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.

What Canada is doing:

Canada is in “a significantly weaker situation than the EU,” says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.

The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the “fining powers” of the EU law.

“There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,” he says.

Levin says there’s been an “absolute lack of will,” on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.

In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn’t have the “power to force Facebook to do anything,” he says.

The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.

“They’re a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they’re a lot more worried about the consequences,” he says.

But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.

In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled “Towards Privacy By Design,” which she believes shows a “clear intent” to enhance the law.

Disinformation

The issue:

In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and “fake news” on social media — especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.

Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious “disinformation.” But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.

And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining “fake news” is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.

Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. “No one’s figured it out,” says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. “We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.”

What others are doing:

Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of “fake news” during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a €75,000 fine.

In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report — released this week following an 18-month investigation — is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.

Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act — sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or “Facebook law” — which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it’s unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)

The penalty for breaking this law? Up to €50 million in fines. “This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,” Tworek says.

What Canada is doing:

“Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,” says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.

He points to Canada’s recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by “third party” advocacy groups during campaign periods — meaning social media companies can’t knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.

Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).

In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public’s ability to detect “online deceptive practices” and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.

But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.

He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to “quickly and efficiently” addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.

One promising spot is Canada’s involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives — including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai — to appear so they can explain what they’re doing to stop the spread of disinformation.

Taxation

The issue:

In the mid 1980s, when Canada’s GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney’s eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google’s founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google — not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon — have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.

They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.

“There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,” says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. “Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.”

Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of “permanent establishment,” Wyonch explains — this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But “our tax code hasn’t been updated to deal with intangibles,” she says.

Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada’s tax coffers).

Meanwhile, domestic companies — which do have to collect and remit sales taxes — argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.

When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. “That is a very complex international system, that we’re waiting for consensus on,” according to Wyonch.

There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. “Did they earn that income where they’re located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?” Wyonch asks. “We don’t have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would — and would not — be considered Canadian income.”

What others are doing:

The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries — like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand — are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.

What Canada is doing:

Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada’s goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.

Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies — including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix — were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.

Competition

The issue:

The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.

Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.

Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data — the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird & Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate — charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay — as a result of customer data they have obtained.

The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.

What others are doing:

The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.

Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the €2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.

Germany’s competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company’s dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform’s owner/operator. The European Commission’s competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.

Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s — or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants’ market dominance.

What Canada is doing:

Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, “this is not in and of itself cause for concern,” according to the Competition Bureau.

In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while “big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau’s traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.”

The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may “soften competition” but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.

Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.

“For competition law enforcement in Canada,” according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, “it’s déjà vu for now.”

Addiction

The issue: This is a newer area, and there’s no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.

There are however “problematic behaviours” associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.

Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.

Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.

Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn’t call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.

Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.

Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he’s seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes “hooking” customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a “cornerstone” of the tech business.

What others are doing:

Other jurisdictions haven’t gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.

France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can’t email employees after business hours, giving individuals “the right to disconnect.”

The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.

“I think it’s interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,” he says.

In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of “immersive and addictive technologies” in December 2018, looking into the “addictive nature of some technologies,” and how they can impact behaviour.

What Canada is doing:

“Not a whole lot has been done,” in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.

Mann says it’s a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.

Copyright

The issue:

Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.

What others are doing:

Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.

A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.

In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.

In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.

Australia, which was described by the country’s attorney general in 2014 as the “worst offender” of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.

What Canada is doing:

In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.

Provisions in Canada’s legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.

The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if “fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.”

Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms’ liability for users’ content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.

58,Empty,2019-02-22T17:50:21Z,The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only.,"The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only. Friends of Canadian Broadcasting had brought the four parties together on the topic: 'Can Canada survive Facebook?' But it didn't feel like that was the top thing on people's minds that night in early February.

Looking out from the podium, I saw a sea of Canadians showing up for a by-election and making their voices heard. Moments before, I'd met the four candidates in a private room at the Delta Hotel and Casino where they all sat around a banquet table nursing glasses of water as they waited for the event to begin. They greeted each other graciously. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson is the candidate for the People's Party of Canada, a far-right populist party led by Maxime Bernier. Jagmeet Singh is the leader of the NDP contending with Conservative Jay Shin and Liberal Richard Lee. Jagmeet Singh was the last to come in and when I said hello, he corrected my pronunciation of his name — it's pronounced ""Jug-meet,"" he told me.

This is Canada, I thought as I observed them, thinking, of course, of the mania and polarization south of the border — stuff some of my Canadian friends tell me just can't happen here. I felt privileged to be shaking hands with the first person of colour to lead a federal party, the savvy, highly educated Conservative candidate, the seasoned Liberal candidate, and the People's Party of Canada candidate who smiled warmly as she said hello. It all felt very civil.

And so, I started the evening as moderator of the Burnaby South all-candidate's debate with an observation. ""It's so great to see democracy in action!"" I meant it: I love grassroots politics. I grew up working in political campaigns that brought all kinds of people from different backgrounds and values together to work for one person, one goal. I respond to the headiness of elections, the hope and potential they bring to make a better world. That better world that never seems to come, but always might this time be in reach.

Anyway, since I moved to Canada in 2001, I often insert somewhere in speeches, a little self-deprecating joke. I haven't ever been able to kick my distinct Southern accent. I figure my Tennessee twang confuses people when I am being introduced as the founder and editor in chief of Canada’s National Observer so I say, 'you may notice from my accent that I'm not a native Canadian. And since moving here in 2001, I've been learning how to be a Canadian. Learning to apologize.' Then, I apologize for something very American that I really don’t like. In the early days of being here, I apologized for George W. Bush. Then came Obama and the joke no longer worked for me. Then came Trump.

I'd just watched the State of the Union address the night before the by-election debate. So, I tried my little joke with the preamble about having learned to apologize, then: ""Trump gave the State of the Union last night… (Pause) I'd just like to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.'""

The room erupted. Some booed at the name ""Trump"" (NDP, Liberals, Conservatives?), but many more were booing at the fact that I was joking about Trump (People's Party of Canada?). Loudly. Very loudly. A big wave of boos.

So much that I burst out laughing. Hey, I've never been booed!

And this crowd was going for it.

Standing on the stage it was like a wave coming at me.



Freshly booed. Looking at this photograph as I write this piece, I see nervousness and surprise in my laughter, but also, delight at the energy of the crowd whether they loved me or hated me. Hey, they were ENGAGED. But as the evening went on, I felt like maybe I was watching a surge of alt-right populism that wasn't very funny. Photo by Michael Ruffolo

""Well, this is going to be an interactive evening,"" I said.

After thoughts

I wish I could have taken notes on the policies and positions the candidates discussed. I remember being impressed by the reflective responses of Singh, Lee and Shin. I remember thinking Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson's answers were sometimes shocking, sometimes down to earth. At moments, she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, to her supporters' delight and cheers. She was true to her self-description: ""Tired of political correctness! Freedom is our greatest gift. TV host, author, speaker. Stand with courage or sink with cowardice."" Why am I talking more about her than the other candidates? Because she was colourful and creative. Following prepared notes, she surprised, deconstructed, and seemed determined to undermine the status quo. The other candidates provided a calm foil that absorbed the shocks, while she kept the fire burning in her supporters.

She made all the other candidates look extremely moderate. Jagmeet Singh held his own very well, never losing his cool, as the waves of populism surged and subsided through the night. The other candidates kept their cool admirably.

It was my first live experience with the People's Party's brand of populism, and I'm guessing we will see the same scenario replay in riding after riding across Canada. Last night, the final all-candidates debate took place in Burnaby South, and tensions apparently continued to climb. I wasn’t there, but according to Burnaby Now’s excellent report, audience members yelled insults at candidates and each other, yelling 'Shame on you!' over immigration and security. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and PPC candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson clashed on immigration, with Thompson bringing up the 2017 murder of a 13-year-old girl by a Syrian refugee, while Singh denounced ""coded language"" used to smear minorities. A Liberal supporter stood up from the crowd and heatedly accused Thompson of racism, sparking a shouting match with other audience members. Some of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s answers were cut off by aggressive jeers from the crowd, Kelvin Gawley reported. The riding has a diverse population, but the debate showed intense polarization among people from all political stripes.

The polarization and heated rhetoric from Burnaby South offers a striking warning for Canada. Canada's top civil servant commented that he fears ""someone is going to be shot"" during the upcoming federal election campaign. Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick lamented the ""vomitorium of social media"" and worried that the reputations of honourable people who have served their country were ""being besmirched and dragged through the market square."" Across Canada, nonetheless, candidates are preparing to enter this treacherous arena. At stake is which party will set the tone for Canadian values for the next 4 years.

Get ready for it. The election is coming to a riding near you.

WASHINGTONIn the yearbook photo of the 1981 graduating class at Westmount High School near Montreal, the left hand of a beaming Kamala Harris is resting on the right shoulder of Hugh Kwok.

When Kwok was asked in December for his thoughts on his old pals potential run, he answered a reporters question with a question.

Shes running for president of what? he asked in a tone that suggested he thought the answer might be the local Rotary Club.

Informed that it was the presidency of the United States, his voice rose. No way. Oh my goodness. I cant believe it, he said. Then he decided he was supportive of this idea.

We could use a good president, he said. She was a sweet, kind person. Very happy, very social. Im just very excited for her, if thats what she wants to do with her life..

This is at least the fourth consecutive presidential election in which a major candidate has had family ties to Canada. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who lost the Republican primary to Donald Trump in 2016, was born in Calgary. Former president Barack Obama has a brother-in-law from Burlington.

Eyal Dattel, a human resources director in Vancouver, said he recalls his drama classmate as always a truly nice person and now sees her as an ideal candidate for a progressive future. (snip...)

In my opinion, shed be a great president, because shes fair, he said.

John Dila, a Harris classmate who is now a Harris constituent as a businessman on the California startup scene, said the Westmount students of the day regularly discussed politics.

(Snip...)Dila, who praised Harris at length, said he thinks she understands policy issues better than American colleagues who have had narrower life experiences.

To: Pete from Shawnee Mission

It’s okay, they catch them upstream from the sewage outflow and the current is strong. Just don’t order fish the next time you’re in Sorel, Trois-Rivieres etc. So more generally, I had a quick look at her bio, she spent her high school years in Canada after her parents divorced, and returned to the USA for university. To be honest, it probably wouldn’t make any difference, most of the Democratic politicians educated at big city U.S. high schools were probably exposed to ritual lib-left views on American politics, whereas in Montreal, Kamala Harris would have been exposed to almost no views on American politics, such courses as she might have taken would have concentrated mostly on Canadian politics and history. Our kids in Canada are not taught very much about America at all, they might know the basic facts about the division of powers and large-scale U.S. history but I only got into that sort of reading in university, those were subjects never really mentioned in high school. So what I’m saying is, she won’t be any weaker than the field as a result, it’s probably a net positive to have avoided the liberal spin of American high school teachers. She doesn’t sound like the worst candidate either, I would prefer her to Bernie or Beto if there had to be one who won. However, I suppose the more important question is, who would be easiest for Trump to beat? There again, would prefer Bernie or Beto. As to the high school being diverse, hmm, maybe they put all the “students of color” on one page? Montreal in the 1980s was not as multicultural as it is nowadays, a lot of Haitians moved there after the 2010 disaster, but it is a largely francophone city with European immigrant groups like Greeks and Italians more than what you might expect to find in Toronto or Vancouver which have large Asian communities (meaning Chinese and Indo, mostly). Westmount is a ritzy inside-the-city enclave (a separate municipality from Montreal) which is also the original home of Pierre Trudeau. Kamala Harris’s mother went there to work at some medical research place associated with the university and big hospitals. Montreal is a leading health research centre. I doubt that much of the outside-Westmount Canadian culture rubbed off on them, it tends to be one of those places where people believe the sun shines from their derrieres and all should bow down and worship. For evidence, take our current glorious leader up here.

60,Empty,2019-02-22T17:50:21Z,I'm sad to say I see the waves of Trumpism spreading across the border. But I do. Get ready for it. I wasn't.…,"The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only. Friends of Canadian Broadcasting had brought the four parties together on the topic: 'Can Canada survive Facebook?' But it didn't feel like that was the top thing on people's minds that night in early February.

Looking out from the podium, I saw a sea of Canadians showing up for a by-election and making their voices heard. Moments before, I'd met the four candidates in a private room at the Delta Hotel and Casino where they all sat around a banquet table nursing glasses of water as they waited for the event to begin. They greeted each other graciously. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson is the candidate for the People's Party of Canada, a far-right populist party led by Maxime Bernier. Jagmeet Singh is the leader of the NDP contending with Conservative Jay Shin and Liberal Richard Lee. Jagmeet Singh was the last to come in and when I said hello, he corrected my pronunciation of his name — it's pronounced ""Jug-meet,"" he told me.

This is Canada, I thought as I observed them, thinking, of course, of the mania and polarization south of the border — stuff some of my Canadian friends tell me just can't happen here. I felt privileged to be shaking hands with the first person of colour to lead a federal party, the savvy, highly educated Conservative candidate, the seasoned Liberal candidate, and the People's Party of Canada candidate who smiled warmly as she said hello. It all felt very civil.

And so, I started the evening as moderator of the Burnaby South all-candidate's debate with an observation. ""It's so great to see democracy in action!"" I meant it: I love grassroots politics. I grew up working in political campaigns that brought all kinds of people from different backgrounds and values together to work for one person, one goal. I respond to the headiness of elections, the hope and potential they bring to make a better world. That better world that never seems to come, but always might this time be in reach.

Anyway, since I moved to Canada in 2001, I often insert somewhere in speeches, a little self-deprecating joke. I haven't ever been able to kick my distinct Southern accent. I figure my Tennessee twang confuses people when I am being introduced as the founder and editor in chief of Canada’s National Observer so I say, 'you may notice from my accent that I'm not a native Canadian. And since moving here in 2001, I've been learning how to be a Canadian. Learning to apologize.' Then, I apologize for something very American that I really don’t like. In the early days of being here, I apologized for George W. Bush. Then came Obama and the joke no longer worked for me. Then came Trump.

I'd just watched the State of the Union address the night before the by-election debate. So, I tried my little joke with the preamble about having learned to apologize, then: ""Trump gave the State of the Union last night… (Pause) I'd just like to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.'""

The room erupted. Some booed at the name ""Trump"" (NDP, Liberals, Conservatives?), but many more were booing at the fact that I was joking about Trump (People's Party of Canada?). Loudly. Very loudly. A big wave of boos.

So much that I burst out laughing. Hey, I've never been booed!

And this crowd was going for it.

Standing on the stage it was like a wave coming at me.



Freshly booed. Looking at this photograph as I write this piece, I see nervousness and surprise in my laughter, but also, delight at the energy of the crowd whether they loved me or hated me. Hey, they were ENGAGED. But as the evening went on, I felt like maybe I was watching a surge of alt-right populism that wasn't very funny. Photo by Michael Ruffolo

""Well, this is going to be an interactive evening,"" I said.

After thoughts

I wish I could have taken notes on the policies and positions the candidates discussed. I remember being impressed by the reflective responses of Singh, Lee and Shin. I remember thinking Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson's answers were sometimes shocking, sometimes down to earth. At moments, she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, to her supporters' delight and cheers. She was true to her self-description: ""Tired of political correctness! Freedom is our greatest gift. TV host, author, speaker. Stand with courage or sink with cowardice."" Why am I talking more about her than the other candidates? Because she was colourful and creative. Following prepared notes, she surprised, deconstructed, and seemed determined to undermine the status quo. The other candidates provided a calm foil that absorbed the shocks, while she kept the fire burning in her supporters.

She made all the other candidates look extremely moderate. Jagmeet Singh held his own very well, never losing his cool, as the waves of populism surged and subsided through the night. The other candidates kept their cool admirably.

It was my first live experience with the People's Party's brand of populism, and I'm guessing we will see the same scenario replay in riding after riding across Canada. Last night, the final all-candidates debate took place in Burnaby South, and tensions apparently continued to climb. I wasn’t there, but according to Burnaby Now’s excellent report, audience members yelled insults at candidates and each other, yelling 'Shame on you!' over immigration and security. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and PPC candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson clashed on immigration, with Thompson bringing up the 2017 murder of a 13-year-old girl by a Syrian refugee, while Singh denounced ""coded language"" used to smear minorities. A Liberal supporter stood up from the crowd and heatedly accused Thompson of racism, sparking a shouting match with other audience members. Some of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s answers were cut off by aggressive jeers from the crowd, Kelvin Gawley reported. The riding has a diverse population, but the debate showed intense polarization among people from all political stripes.

The polarization and heated rhetoric from Burnaby South offers a striking warning for Canada. Canada's top civil servant commented that he fears ""someone is going to be shot"" during the upcoming federal election campaign. Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick lamented the ""vomitorium of social media"" and worried that the reputations of honourable people who have served their country were ""being besmirched and dragged through the market square."" Across Canada, nonetheless, candidates are preparing to enter this treacherous arena. At stake is which party will set the tone for Canadian values for the next 4 years.

Get ready for it. The election is coming to a riding near you.

61,Empty,2019-02-22T14:10:21Z,Socialists take it for granted that socialist ideas can be adopted without changing the quality of freedom in a society. Many Democrats believe they can be socialists as well as democrats,"In 1976 the sage Irving Kristol wrote that “The most important political event of the twentieth century is not the crisis of capitalism but the death of socialism.” He was one of the most brilliant thinkers in America, but he was quite wrong. It was communism that seemed to be breathing its last in the 1970s, not socialism.

The Soviet Union was dying, and with it all the puppet states the Soviets established in their vast empire. But in many places socialism remained alive, from Sweden to British Columbia. The Swedish Social Democratic Party has won most elections there since 1932, but never declared other forms of politics illegal — as a communist party would naturally (and happily) have done. In B.C. the provincial government administered the universal health-care system established by Canada, and the people sometimes voted for the socialist NDP. But few Canadians or British Columbians yearned for a communist system. The one thing is not like the other. Gulags, mass executions and rigid censorship come with communism. Socialism, though it might be a little self-righteous, manages to avoid the horrors.

The Economist magazine appeared this week with a coverline trumpeting “The Rise of Millennial Socialism.” (The word “millennial” was justified by a U.S. poll showing that young people thought socialism an agreeable idea.) Considering applied socialist ideas, the Economist notes off-handedly that the U.S. lacks a system of universal health care, which is “Normal elsewhere in the rich world.” Well, the U.S. is indeed rich but, weirdly, has never got around to universal medicare.

Many Americans are afraid of the idea. It sounds foreign enough to make them nervous. Socialists take it for granted that socialist ideas can be adopted without changing the quality of freedom in a society. Many Democrats believe they can be socialists as well as democrats. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most talked-about new member of congress, is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Bernie Sanders, the 77-year-old Vermont senator and candidate for the presidency in 2020, comes equipped with a full socialist agenda: he’s for lower prescription prices, free tuition in public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and of course universal health care.

A few prominent Democrats clearly avoid being marked as socialists. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, perhaps unwilling to join an expanding club, says “I am not a democratic socialist.” On other hand, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s “wealth tax,” is just the thing Republicans watch for and hate.

Despite everyone’s attempt to explain it, a universal health system will sound to conservatives like the first step on the road to the gulag. Perhaps we might withdraw the word “socialist” and substitute the word “co-operative.” Americans accept one enormously complicated national system, far more impressive than the country’s health system in its present condition — the roads.

They are beautiful to behold, great endless stripes of construction that reach every city and town in the country, planned and built to a standard of high excellence. They are maintained, for the most part, superbly. They are a mutual community project for all of the country, and absolutely necessary for maintaining American civilization. Many businesses, large and small, have profited from their construction and upkeep, but the roads are paid for co-operatively from everyone’s taxes, just as a universal health service would be — and no one ever said that the road system was socialist.

His position on the Collegium of the University of St. Michael’s College was one vehicle through which Rosica exerted a deep influence on Catholic public life in Canada.

Rosica has been one of the church’s key communicator to the country at large, especially on papal affairs like elections and visits, and recently helped the Vatican communicate to media at its summit on youth protection. He is also founding CEO of the religious television channel Salt and Light.

Neither the Vatican Dicastery for Communications nor Salt and Light have replied to invitations to comment on his admission to the National Post that he presented other people’s words as his own in various newspapers and publications, including the Salt and Light website and the Post itself.

He admitted this kind of behaviour is dishonest, and said in an interview that it was wrong, but in the absence of a fuller public explanation, he has been criticized on Twitter for appearing to blame interns and other subordinates who helped with his writing.

In a written statement to the Post last week, he said: “If there was an error on my part, it is that I have often relied on others who have generously helped me in my preparation of various texts and I did not do the necessary checking into sources, etc. I regret that. It was never willfully done.”

He said he failed to thoroughly review his writings and cite sources because of “urgent media requests.”

Rev. Donald McLeod, chair of the Collegium, said Rosica made “significant contributions” to the school, which has an undergraduate program and a graduate theology faculty.

“Over the weekend, I received and have respectfully accepted his resignation from the Collegium,” he said.

We embrace our brother despite this failing for which he has taken full responsibility

In a statement, Kevin Storey, Superior General of the Basilian Fathers, which founded the school, said: “Plagiarism of any kind is wrong. When it is committed knowingly it rises to the level of a moral offense. As a community of Catholic educators we condemn it, without qualification.”

“At the same time, we embrace our brother despite this failing for which he has taken full responsibility. With him, we apologize to those who have been offended by the misuse of their literary gifts,” he said.

The Jesuits of Canada also announced Monday they had withdrawn an invitation for Rosica ro receive their Magis Award at an upcoming gala.

“Plagiarism is a grave offense against intellectual honesty and the community of scholarship,” the congregation said in a statement.

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse because—in fired FBI Director James Comey’s formulation—a “higher duty” than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Or—in fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s words—“the threat” was too great. Nevermind that the nature of “the threat” was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offenders—and OffensesThe extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureau’s ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as “an insurance policy” against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming president’s reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

The Canadian peer blamed the Justice Department and the FBI, then led by James Comey (pictured) of interfering in the election

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students’ treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public AttentionThe special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the “high crimes and misdemeanors” required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the president’s enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his “higher duty,” lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s (pictured) supporters, Black wrote

And now we have Andrew McCabe’s proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the PollsThis entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsel’s inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the election’s result.

65,Empty,2019-02-22T01:56:20Z,"The most logical version was that either Trudeau or Butts, tried to persuade Wilson-Raybould to grant SNC a remediation agreement at meetings in September and December","OTTAWA — Michael Wernick wandered into the justice committee like a sun-struck madman and gave real answers to the questions he was asked by MPs not used to such transparency.

After two weeks of politicians citing “solicitor-client privilege” in the SNC Lavalin case, we finally got somewhere.

The public service generally operates on the principle that if there is nothing to be gained by saying something, it is generally better to say nothing than anything.

But the country’s top bureaucrat was provocative and unapologetic — perhaps because he is the likely source of any pressure, undue or otherwise, said to have been put on Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general, over the prospect of a deferred prosecution agreement that would curtail the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

From his opening statement, it was clear the clerk of the Privy Council was in feisty mood. He said he is worried about his country, about foreign interference in elections, about rising tides of incitement to violence (“I’m worried someone is going to get shot in this country this year during the political campaign”) and about people losing faith in the institutions of governance in the country.

The SNC story plays into that, he said.

The public service generally operates on the principle that if there is nothing to be gained by saying something, it is generally better to say nothing than anything

Despite the publicity around SNC, Canadians should have faith because the independence of the investigation and prosecution of the company have never been compromised. He pointed to laws that are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held — the software protecting our democracy is working,” he said.

“Is there two-tier justice in Canada? No, demonstrably not. Despite the most extensive government relations effort in modern times, the company (SNC) didn’t get what it wanted.”

He defended the concept of deferred prosecution agreements as an attempt to balance public policy concerns, amid “legitimate” concerns by governments that workers, suppliers and pensioners of a company suffer from the misdeeds of corporate officials. “They are not an acquittal, an amnesty, an exoneration, a get-out-of-jail card or a slap on the wrist,” he said.

That was the background against which MPs set out on an expedition to get some answers.

Justin Trudeau has evolved into a politician so well versed in the art of denial, he can’t say yes.

Hence the confusion over who said what to whom. The most logical version of events to this point was that either Trudeau or his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, tried to persuade Wilson-Raybould to grant SNC a remediation agreement at meetings in September and December.

Is there two-tier justice in Canada? No, demonstrably not. Despite the most extensive government relations effort in modern times, the company (SNC) didn’t get what it wanted

But Wernick was at the meeting between the former justice minister and the prime minister on Sept. 17 and said that Trudeau was clear the final decision on SNC was hers alone. “The prime minister said verbally and in writing that she was the decider.”

He said in his experience, Trudeau and his staff “always, always conducted themselves to the highest level of integrity. You may not like their policies, or their politics or their tweets but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing.”

Having exonerated Trudeau and Butts, Wernick revealed that he himself is the likely source of any disquiet Wilson-Raybould may have over SNC.

He predicted that when the former attorney general appears before the committee next week, she will express concerns about a phone call he had with her on Dec. 19.

He said he called her that afternoon to discuss the SNC file and whether a deferred prosecution agreement was still an option, even though she had ruled out intervening during her conversation with the prime minister in September.

Wernick revived the issue, saying her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of the company, which was being discussed openly in the business press.

You may not like their policies, or their politics or their tweets but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing.

“I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context,” he said, while acknowledging she may have her own views on the issue. “But that is for the ethics commissioner to sort out,” he said. “My conclusion and my assertion is that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter.”

Murray Rankin, the NDP justice critic, pointed out that Wilson-Raybould was fired, “sorry removed,” for not offering a remediation deal.

Wernick refuted the suggestion, saying she was not fired, but was offered another position in cabinet that she accepted. At no time, he said, did she raise any concerns with the prime minister or the ethics commissioner.

He was vocal in his opinion that Wilson-Raybould should not be muzzled by solicitor-client privilege when she appears at committee next week. “I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor. The matter was never discussed at cabinet, never. She was not advising the prime minister,” he said.

What to make of it all? It bore the hallmarks of a man unconstrained by the need to get re-elected, with nothing to lose in terms of self-advancement (Wernick has worked in the public service for 37 years and has reached its apex).

The odds on him continuing in his current job should the Conservatives win in October were not improved by his staunch defence of Trudeau and his advisers. Wernick declared himself “neutral” and pointed out he has served as a public servant under seven prime ministers. One academic suggested some of his comments sounded like “cheer-leading” for the current government. He certainly came close to crossing lines.

But no clerk is a wallflower at the orgy — he or she has to be invested in the success or failure of the government, if the relationship is going to work.

By his testimony at the committee, Wernick showed he is heavily invested.

He expressed himself frustrated by media coverage, taking issue with the Globe and Mail story that started this affair. He stated clearly he does not believe there is a case to answer. And he obviously relishes the prospect of Wilson-Raybould giving her version of events next week, unfettered by privilege.

In light of his testimony, Wernick is suggesting the SNC affair boils down to whether there is an objective standard when it comes to defining what is “lawful and appropriate” in conversations between the attorney general and others.

Legal precedent in the U.K. suggests those conversations are more likely to be judged by a subjective standard, said Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, who was also a witness at the committee.

No thanks to anyone in this government, its case is now on firmer ground.

Fuelled by social media, the protests have revealed the depth of anger over the rising cost of living and the alleged disappearance of billions of dollars from PetroCaribe — an oil subsidy program intended to help the impoverished Haitian people.

Mirambeau, a Haitian-Canadian filmmaker who divides his time between the two countries, said he was in Canada last summer when he became fascinated by the debate on social media over the alleged mismanagement of the PetroCaribe fund, a 2005 pact under which Venezuela provided oil to Caribbean nations with long-term, low-interest financing. The savings on oil were supposed to be used to fund economic and social programs, but Mirambeau and many Haitians say it disappeared into the pockets of government officials, who spent it on extravagant luxuries such as mansions, casinos, and cars. “I was witnessing this, and the whole night I couldn’t sleep,” said Mirambeau, who donned a blindfold in the picture to symbolize justice. “I had to play my part, in a sense.”

Mirambeau, 35, said his message was posted about a month after government fuel hikes in July 2018 spurred riots among a population struggling to pay for basic staples. It was retweeted by a popular rapper and actor, and other Haitians quickly joined in, using the hashtag #petrocaribechallenge. Mirambeau became part of a loose coalition of leaders and activists involved in organizing a series of protests, each designed to take place on a significant date in Haiti’s history. Since last year, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest corruption and demand the resignation of the country’s president, Jovenel Moise. “Social media played a big part because we could point fingers at the senators, deputies, state members, and it was in their face,” he said. The most recent uprisings, which began Feb. 7, led to the Canadian government issuing a travel warning for Haiti. More than 100 Canadians had to be airlifted to the airport last week to avoid blockades along the country’s highways, where armed protesters threw rocks, fired weapons and set fire to burning tires during sometimes violent protests. Mirambeau blamed the violence on gang members infiltrating what is a peaceful movement. “The movement is not violent,” he said. “You had a million people in the street, and they could have destroyed everything, but they were not violent.”

He said Haitians are fed up after years of alleged corruption by authorities, whom he says have largely mismanaged the PetroCaribe money and the billions of dollars designed to help the country recover from a 2010 earthquake that decimated the country’s infrastructure. “What we feel is more than rage,” he said. “It’s social apartheid. You have the government on the side making money with our taxes and money.”

A Haitian Senate investigation has alleged embezzlement by at least 14 former officials in ex-president Michel Martelly’s administration, but no one has been charged. Late last week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant vowed to deepen the probe into spending of the estimated $3.8 billion Haiti received as part of the oil program — one of a raft of measures aimed at quelling the protests. Jean-Claude Icart, a researcher with the Quebec-based aid partnership Concertation pour Haiti, said Mirambeau’s tweet played a role in sparking the protests, which appear to have eased since the prime minister’s speech. Icart said that for the protests to stop, the government will have to take concrete steps to improve living conditions and reduce food insecurity. “The misery is becoming unbearable, and people who are hopeless, you don’t know what they’re going to do,” he said in a phone interview. Pascal Paradis, the executive director of Lawyers Without Borders Canada, said he sees reason for hope in the protest movement’s demand for justice, led by young people such as Mirambeau. “The fight against impunity needs to start with civil society,” he said. Mirambeau, meanwhile, says the protests will continue until those responsible for the missing PetroCaribe funds are tried and convicted. He rules out running for office himself, but he hopes his generation will produce leaders to run in the next elections and eventually reform Haiti’s government, including the constitution. “It needs to start with us,” he said. “We are the change.”",How a Haitian-Canadian’s message helped fuel an uprising,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/22/how-a-haitian-canadians-message-helped-fuel-an-uprising.html

Starting with the Harris government, continuing through the Harper years, to their several provincial cousins today — some of different parties — campaign planning today is devoted more to wrecking strategies directed at the personal reputations of opponents, than to how they would improve Canadians lives.

The federal leaders of Canada’s three major parties, from left: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Many voters, young and old, choose their horse based on shrewd observation of who seems authentic and which leader they believe has the ability to defend their interests best. Other than hard partisans, many fewer choose who delivers the best insults,” writes Robin V. Sears. ( Norma Zminkowska )

Sadly, it often works, as its champions often brag. We appear to be on the verge of sliding into yet one more election campaign marked by anger, vituperation and insult. But examining political history paints a somewhat less gloomy alternative approach. The biggest, boldest, most optimistic vision has often overcome the venomous. Mulroney trounced Turner, Layton romped through Quebec, and Justin Trudeau crushed his opponents. In each case their messages where of a bigger and better Canada, against a gloomier, dystopic vision buttressed by nasty sound bites and, these days, sensational clickbait tweets. Even in the U.S. it’s useful to consider how campaigns of animus did against those of other more visionary leaders. Not to give the Trump aberration more credit than it is due, we might recall that Reagan/Carter, Clinton/Dole, Obama/McCain were all matchups that went to the sunnier visions. A Biden/Trump matchup might have turned out differently, too.

Justin Trudeau can hardly campaign on sunny ways again, without being laughed at. But he can still articulate a confident progressive agenda, and not mud-wrestle with Scheer in the political ditch each day. Despite his unhappy few months, when Jagmeet Singh enters the House of Commons next month he should be able to convey his message of inclusion, optimism and a bold vision for Canada, and still be tough in Question Period. Those were the messages that won him the leadership, in part echoing the Layton’s “love over fear” mission, and partly referencing his own life story as proof of what is possible in a Canada that dreams big. Unless they have a change of heart over the summer, it seems clear that the Scheer campaign strategy will be grounded first in sneering at the Trudeau failures — most clearly now SNC-Lavalin. He will be challenged from the right by the nasty identitarian politics of Max Bernier. Even including a subtheme of the old-time American conservative fairy tale — lower taxes, better service and smaller government, all funded by the “billions and billions” of dollars of waste and corruption in Ottawa — he will be pushed to attack first and always. With two articulate progressive visions opposing him, he might be wiser to return to Conservative “big message” politics. Liberal failure to deliver is obviously fair game, but how will Scheer make Canadians’ lives better? Singh’s vulnerability will be in the numbers — polling, funds raised and strong new candidates recruited. But voters across the Western world have confounded pundits time and again in recent years, swinging from one pole to a widely distant one in a single leap, not always in response to incitement politics.

Macron smashed the left and right with a “new France” vision. However delusionary you may believe his program, Jeremy Corbyn almost defeated British Conservatives with a big change agenda. Democrats are rolling out very bold — perhaps, overly so — visions for America. Many voters, young and old, choose their horse based on shrewd observation of who seems authentic and which leader they believe has the ability to defend their interests best. Other than hard partisans, many fewer choose who delivers the best insults.

Thirtysomethings have shown their faith in a bigger, fairer, greener Canada in the past two federal elections. That does not seem to have ebbed. The twentysomethings are always harder to read because of turnout, but we know that when they do vote, it is less often a response to attack politics than to a bigger vision for their futures. So, to each of the party strategists: Don’t put all your money on how mean and tough you can look. Canadians respect and do vote for leaders with bolder visions too. Robin V.

America Shouldn't Invade Venezuela

Venezuela has been in crisis for years. Now President Donald Trump has made Venezuela’s problems America’s problems.

Two decades ago Hugo Chávez successfully challenged a collectivist, kleptocratic political system which enriched the country’s elite. But he created a quasi-dictatorship staffed by Cuban security agents and wrecked the economy by imposing real socialism and handing control to corrupt apparatchiks. Chávez even destroyed the state petroleum company by turning it into a lucrative source of patronage.

The situation deteriorated further under Chávez’s successor, President Nicolás Maduro. Today both food and medicine are increasingly difficult to find. Even Venezuela’s poor, who propelled Chávez into power, have given up on his bungling, charisma-challenged successor.

Last year President Trump threatened to invade Venezuela. He backed down, but recently launched a vigorous campaign for regime change through diplomatic and economic pressure. America’s great hope is in opposition leader Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, who declared himself to be Venezuela’s legitimate president. If Guaidó’s campaign fails, war remains “an option,” declared the president.

That might be a bluff, intended to intimidate Maduro and his supporters. However, if President Trump is serious, the consequences could be disastrous for both Venezuela and the United States.

The former is a tragedy on multiple levels. Like many Latin American political systems, it long enshrined great economic injustice. In 1992 Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chávez staged a coup. Despite some popular support it failed and he was imprisoned. But he was soon pardoned and in 1998 was elected president, serving until his death in 2013.

His “Bolivarian Revolution” was authoritarian and socialist, with predictable results. Mass nationalization, uncontrolled spending, and political interference ensured long-term economic disaster. For a time oil revenue funded social programs, sustaining popular support. He also shared his regime’s largesse overseas—providing subsidized petroleum shipments to Cuba’s Castro dictatorship, for instance. However, oil revenue declined as his maladministration hobbled PDVSA, the state-run energy company, and petroleum prices dropped.

Vice President Maduro replaced Chávez, but the Maduro lacked any hint of charisma or competence. The economy was cut by half over his six years in power and is expected to shrink another quarter this year alone. The latest annual inflation estimate—the regime stopped releasing economic statistics—is an incredible 1.7 million percent. Nine out of ten people fall below the poverty line. Stores are empty. Every day 80,000 people cross into Colombia seeking provisions. An expectant mother turned border street vendor explained: “in Venezuela there is nothing.” Yet President Maduro rejected offers of humanitarian aid, insisting that there is no crisis and “we are not beggars.” So far some three million people, a tenth of the population, have fled, and more are leaving every day.

Four out of five Venezuelans, including even many “Chavistas” and working-class supporters of Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution,” want him gone. Maduro maintains control through increasing repression and electoral manipulation. His last lines of defense are his core allies (who in recent years have looted the economy to the tune of $350 billion), his puppets in the National Assembly, and a thousand-plus Cuban operatives, long embedded in his government.

Maduro should go. Actually, straight to jail. But the Trump administration-led campaign seems designed to fail.

Even successful regime change won’t necessarily turn out well. By one count, Washington pursued sixty-eight attempts at regime change in different countries since 1945. Most failed, and even successful operations often yielded dubious results.

But getting rid of Maduro won’t be easy. Washington lacks credibility as a disinterested actor dedicated to the good of the Venezuelan people. Alas, Americans well-earned their reputation for “Yankee imperialism” through more than a century of military intervention in Latin America. Skeptics of Washington’s purported humanitarian intentions point to Venezuela’s 301 billion barrel oil reserves as a rich prize for American companies. Even many critics of Maduro do not back the U.S. campaign to oust the incumbent regime: a poll last month found 78 percent of Venezuelans opposed international intervention.

Threats of war have intensified regional skepticism. James Stavridis, the former North Atlantic Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander, said, “everywhere I went as a four-star Admiral in [Latin America] while commanding U.S Southern Command, I would be reminded of America’s history of intervention.” Even Brazil and Colombia were “deeply suspicious” of the creation of the Fourth Fleet in 2008, which was seen not as a tool for use in such tasks as drug interdiction and humanitarian relief, but as “a return to gunboat diplomacy and a prelude to military action in Venezuela.”

By taking the lead, the Trump administration has become an issue. Rallying people against outside pressure is a time-honored international tactic, especially by populist Latin American regimes. Some Venezuelans will choose local thugs over foreign meddlers. Moreover, Washington’s high-profile effort has encouraged Russia and China to rally to Maduro’s side. Their support will be limited but could help the regime survive.

Indeed, the administration will undermine attempts to employ the rule of international law in other cases. The U.S. claim that it is justified in breaking international rules, argued Representative Ro Khanna (D-Cal.), “is the same argument that led to U.S. blunders in Iraq, Honduras, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Again and again, there is no respect for the United Nations Charter that makes it illegal under international law to seek regime change.”

Washington hopes to starve the Venezuelan people. The Trump administration sanctioned PDVSA to dry up oil revenues keeping the government and country afloat. (Petroleum sales provide more than 95 percent of Venezuela’s export earnings.) The Trump administration also turned Venezuelan state property over to the nascent Guaidó “government.”

Unfortunately, tougher economic controls are unlikely to force the regime to yield. Reducing the Maduro regime’s money will hurt it, but probably not enough to cripple it. Sanctions also will reduce funds available for the Venezuelan public, since the government controls most trade. However, Maduro and his allies will take care of themselves first. Complained Jose Bodas, an anti-Maduro union leader: “The rich will not stop getting richer, it’s the workers who will shoulder the cost of these measures.”

Starving the already suffering, whose vigorous opposition so far has failed to budge the regime, in hopes of fomenting a more effective uprising is a dubious strategy on both practical and moral grounds. Luis Vicente Leon, who heads the political consulting firm Datanalisis, said: “If this strategy isn’t successful quickly, the effect on the people will be devastating.” Unsurprisingly, eight of ten Venezuelans oppose U.S. sanctions.

Washington hopes that Maduro’s backers will end his reign, but their survival is tied to his. Most importantly, the military leadership, which Chávez transformed after the short-lived coup against him in 2002, has prospered along with the regime. Even if the Chavista elite decided to send Maduro packing, there is no reason to believe it would hand the keys to the kingdom to Guaidó or organize free elections.

Regime fractures might lead to civil war, with multiple contending factions. The outcome is impossible to predict. Although Guaidó unexpectedly unified the highly fractious opposition, he leans toward the socialist end of the economic spectrum. Some groups on the right complain that his Popular Will party is a member of the Socialist International. A bloody collapse might satisfy the Trump administration but could intensify the suffering of the Venezuelan population.

If the administration fails to oust Maduro through diplomacy and sanctions, it will suffer a major public relations embarrassment. Warned Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes: “Chest-thumping declarations that melt away over time weaken American power and credibility.” But Washington has no apparent alternative if the Maduro regime doesn’t fold. Worried Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue: “My concern is whether they’ve boxed themselves in.” An impasse would encourage the president to act militarily.

Yet nothing justifies war. Vice President Mike Pence recently declared that “For the sake of our vital interests, and for the sake of the Venezuelan people, America will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.” However, what vital American interest can he identify? There is none.

Admiral Craig Faller, head of the United State Southern Command, announced that “We are prepared to protect U.S. lives and protect the diplomatic facility in Venezuela.” However, Washington is keeping American diplomats on station as an explicit provocation. The Maduro government ordered U.S. personnel home, but the administration refused to comply. Washington may hope for an incident to justify military action. There also has been talk of using American military forces to move humanitarian aid into Venezuela, daring the Maduro government to block the effort. This would constitute the foreign policy equivalent of entrapment, enticing Caracas to take a step providing a casus belli.

Moreover, Fernando Cutz, who formerly served on the staff of the National Security Council, argued: “I don’t think you can underestimate the threat of a failed state very close to our borders.” Venezuela’s crisis certainly is bad for the country’s South American neighbors. However, the United States would hardly notice. Would millions of refugees swim the Caribbean and overrun Florida? Would al-Qaeda set up shop in anarchic Caracas? War-happy American officials routinely claim “vital interests” where none exist.

The Venezuelan people are suffering, but so are the peoples of Eritrea, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, and many more nations. Ironically, Washington supports, aids, and comforts the oppressor in several of these cases. In others, the Trump administration simply ignores friends acting badly. Nothing occurring in Venezuela justifies America embarking upon another war of choice.

Fear that the administration is inclined toward war caused Senate Democrats to insist that any resolution backing Guaidó include explicit disapproval of U.S. military action. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) refused the accept the measure with such a prohibition. “The U.S. always reserves the right on use force and protect its own national security interest and the interest of its personnel. So anything that would run counter to that would be problematic.” But he is being disingenuous since he routinely treats military action as a first resort.

Venezuela’s Guaidó suggested that he might come to welcome, even “authorize,” U.S. military action, though that “is not the form we hope for and believe in.” He also suggested that all options are on the table, the standard mantra of American officials who threaten war, and later argued that if the Maduro government blocked delivery of outside aid, that military intervention would be warranted under the UN “responsibility to protect” doctrine. However, as Representative Ro Khanna (D-Ca.) responded: “Mr. Guaidó, you can proclaim yourself leader of Venezuela but you don’t get to authorize U.S. military interventions. Only the U.S. Congress can do that. We will not.” And it should not.

Initiating another war of choice simply because the United States could do so would further unbalance American foreign policy. These days policymakers find it difficult to resist the temptation to use America’s overwhelming military power even though consequences are routinely ill. War should be a genuine last resort.

Secretary of State and later President John Quincy Adams appeared to foresee our world when he warned Americans not to go “abroad, in search of monsters to destroy” lest they risk their nation’s soul. The U.S. “might become the dictatress of the world” and “be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.” Which would be too high a price to pay.

The president appears to believe that an invasion would be easy, last year arguing that “It’s a regime that frankly could be toppled very quickly by the military, if the military decides to do that.” But believing the next war to be a cakewalk is a far too common mistake made by overly-optimistic political leaders. Most wars turn out far different and more costly than expected. For instance, in 1812 House Speaker Henry Clay declared that conquering Canada would be “a mere matter of marching.” More than two centuries later, of course, America’s northern neighbor remains free.

The only recent Latin American precedent was the 1989 invasion of Panama. However, circumstances were significantly different: a much smaller nation, ruled by a dictator with little popular backing, containing the U.S.-constructed canal long controlled by Washington. American troops already were stationed there, and the local government had killed several U.S. civilians.

The Maduro regime obviously would lose any conflict. Its armed services have suffered from years of economic crisis. Chávez purged potentially dissident officers in order to coup-proof the military, meaning trustworthiness trumped competence. Moreover, the army became a source of patronage and bulges with useless generals.

Nevertheless, there are capable units—special forces, airborne, and counter-insurgency, for instance. Admiral Faller told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Venezuelan military, though a “degraded force,” nevertheless “remains loyal to Maduro—and that makes it dangerous.” Moreover, the civil militia has an official membership of 1.6 million. Just last month 86 percent of Venezuelans said they opposed foreign military action. Invaders might not find themselves hailed as liberators even by those hoping for an end to Maduro’s misrule.

Urban resistance could prove difficult to quell, especially by soldiers dispersed into guerrilla units. Resistance also could turn into a civil war, further inflaming social divisions which would make fixing Venezuela even tougher. Having broken Venezuela with an invasion, America would feel great pressure to occupy and rebuild it.

Through this process, the Chavistas might shift blame for their misrule onto their new occupiers. Washington would own the results of its war. American support would undermine the new government’s legitimacy. And ousting Maduro would not resolve the underlying political conflicts which triggered Chávez’s rise. Overall, the costs of exercising the military option are obvious; the benefits less so.

Unfortunately, as time passes Washington appears to have another potential foreign policy debacle in the making. Guaidó’s announcement led to expectations of a speedy denouement: sanctions would crush the regime, military elites would defect and defenestrate Maduro, Chavista elites would accept the offer of amnesty and depart, and a new regime would emerge, fulfilling American objectives. Increasingly a peaceful U.S. victory appears unlikely.

Alas, no one, it seems, has an alternative approach. Reported Bloomberg: “U.S. policymakers and those around Guaidó—as well as leaders in Brazil and Colombia—are eying one another and worrying about failure. Officials in each camp have said privately they assumed the others had a more developed strategy.”

Evidently not. The situation would have the makings of comedy sitcom if the stakes weren’t so high. So now what?

Washington should lower its expectations and step back, leaving regime transformation to Venezuelans and their neighbors. Most important, President Trump should keep the troops at home. Simón Bolívar, the heroic revolutionary who liberated Venezuela from Spain, long ago intoned: “when tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right.” But in this case, that right should be exercised by Venezuelans, not Americans.

With most Canadians still digesting the news of Meng Wanzhou’s detention, and the U.S. extradition request behind it, the United Association of Women and Children of Canada appeared before the cameras to demand the executive’s immediate release.

“Canada should stay out of it,” a spokeswoman declared in Mandarin, her translated comments generating a number of stories in local media. “This is supposed to be a serious matter but looks like a joke between the two countries.”

Leaders of the United Association insisted they had no connection to the Chinese government, which had been making similar pronouncements.

But a closer look reveals a more complicated story, one that seems to point to Beijing’s long reach into Canadian affairs.

Behind the event were two women with clear ties to China, generous donations to political parties here and, in one case, a colourful history in Canadian law and municipal politics.

Lawyer Hong Guo boasts that she was appointed as a foreign legal specialist by the the People’s Republic, and while running for mayor of Richmond, B.C. last year insisted “there is no human rights abuse in China.”

All but a tiny handful of Canadians of Chinese heritage are here because they do not wish to be ruled or controlled by the CCP

Before immigrating to Canada, association founder Han Dongmei launched her investment fund in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, a Communist mecca usually reserved for august party and state functions. Her company contributed $100,000 to the B.C. Liberal party while it was still in government.

Han could not be reached for comment. Guo did not respond to telephone messages and emailed questions about the Meng event and possible co-ordination with Chinese officials. China’s embassy also did not answer emailed questions.

There is no direct evidence the women were acting at the behest of Beijing, or even just trying to curry favour with it for business reasons.

But there is mounting concern generally about China’s influence campaign in countries like Canada, much of it executed through the United Front Work Department, a secretive offshoot of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) known to work with ethnic Chinese organizations overseas.

“Establishing fake civil society NGOs is an established modus operandi” of the United Front, said Charles Burton, a Brock University professor and former Canadian diplomat in Beijing.

According to its website, the Vancouver-based United Association of Women and Children has 1,500 members, branches in several provinces and a focus on equal treatment and work opportunities for women — but it lists no contact information.

Two B.C. leaders of the non-profit sector dedicated to helping women in business — Laurel Douglas of the Women’s Enterprise Centre and Lisa Niemetscheck of WebAlliance — told the National Post they had never heard of it.

The Chinese media in China, they have very much freedom, to talk and to criticize and to make suggestions

The group seems to have “all the hallmarks” of a front organization to further Beijing’s interests, says Jonathan Manthorpe, whose just-published book, Claws of the Panda, documents China’s influence campaign here.

In the midst of a “political offensive by the Beijing regime,” he cautioned, people should remember that such organizations do not represent Chinese-Canadians.

“All but a tiny handful of Canadians of Chinese heritage are here because they do not wish to be ruled or controlled by the CCP,” said Manthorpe.

The group’s speakers, Guo in English and Han in Mandarin, told the news conference Canada was being used by the U.S. to attack Huawei and China, that Canadian courts had no jurisdiction over a Chinese citizen like Meng and Canada was needlessly undermining relations between the two countries.

“Their statement precisely echoes the Chinese Government’s official response to Meng Wanzhou’s arrest,” notes Burton, also a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

As the CBC, CTV, local Richmond News and others reported those comments, they cited the group’s denial of links to China’s government.

What was less clear, though, is the personal ties both spokeswomen have to their home country’s power centres.

Guo immigrated from China in 1993, obtained a Master’s degree from the University of Regina and then a law degree from the University of Windsor. Her Richmond-based law firm specializes in “Sino-Canadian commercial transactions.”

From 2002 to 2005, her website says, she acted as a “foreign legal specialist” for China, appointed by the 35-member state council of the People’s Republic — the country’s chief administrative authority.

But it was when Guo decided to run for mayor in Richmond last year, campaigning in part on strengthening ties with China, that her perspective on the country came startlingly into focus.

Asked by The Breaker news website about China’s human-rights record, she insisted that reports of rights abuses were an invention of foreign media like the New York Times and CBC.

“I think China has lots of freedom of speech,” she told the site. “The Chinese media in China, they have very much freedom, to talk and to criticize and to make suggestions.”

The Guo election campaign itself, conducted almost entirely in Mandarin, also raised eyebrows.

“Only Chinese people can understand what Chinese people want,” said a video played at the launch, the Richmond News reported. Chinese-Canadians should “vote for Chinese candidates to speak on our behalf,” Guo said in a speech, before finishing in fourth place.

Canada should stay out of it. This is supposed to be a serious matter but looks like a joke between the two countries

She was likely not helped by disciplinary charges from the Law Society of British Columbia that alleged, among other breaches, that she failed to adequately safeguard trust accounts — allowing for a $7.5 million employee theft.

Cheuk Kwan, spokesman for the Toronto Association for Democracy in China, said he does not know Guo, but noted generally that Beijing seems to be encouraging immigrants from mainland China to run for office here, even if sometimes “they have no understanding of how democracy works in the Canadian context.”

Han appears to have immigrated in the last five years or so, heading up a firm called Huamulan Developments Inc. with an apparent goal to build student housing. According to biographies on a number of Chinese-language websites, the company was launched nine years ago in the Great Hall of the People, a landmark on Beijing’s Tianamen Square that, in the words of a government account, has hosted many “earth-shaking historical events.”

That same year, the firm organized a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, the bios say.

There is little visible sign of Huamulan’s work in Canada, though it has held events attended by representatives of Vancouver’s Chinese consulate, and local politicians — with Han performing her own songs at some.

Like its founder, Huamulan has also been an active political donor. Its three contributions to the B.C. Liberal Party from 2015 to 2017 — when the Liberals were voted out of power — totaled $99,000, among the largest corporate gifts recorded by Elections B.C.

A donor with Han’s name gave $5,800 to the federal Conservatives and $2,400 to the Liberals between 2014 and 2016, according to Elections Canada.

Guo talks on her website of making contacts with various Canadian politicians, and is even pictured online with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Her one donation, $1,500 in 2017, was to the federal Liberal riding association of MP Geng Tan, a mainland China immigrant, though his seat is in another province. Tan once headed the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at the University of Toronto, an organization believed to report directly to the United Front.

As they faced the TV cameras at their December news conference, the two women had a clear message for those politicians they had earlier courted and funded. Even if, as they said, Beijing played no part in the event, it would likely have approved.

“The Chinese people would like to keep the good relationship to expand the business with Canada,” said Guo, according to a CTV report. “But this matter will damage that because people understand Canada is doing something for the benefit of America.”

By taking the lead, the Trump administration has become an issue. Rallying people against outside pressure is a time-honored international tactic, especially by populist Latin American regimes. Some Venezuelans will choose local thugs over foreign meddlers. Moreover, Washington’s high-profile effort has encouraged Russia and China to rally to Maduro’s side. Their support will be limited but could help the regime survive.

Indeed, the administration will undermine attempts to employ the rule of international law in other cases. The U.S. claim that it is justified in breaking international rules, argued Representative Ro Khanna (D-Cal.), “is the same argument that led to U.S. blunders in Iraq, Honduras, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Again and again, there is no respect for the United Nations Charter that makes it illegal under international law to seek regime change.”

Washington hopes to starve the Venezuelan people. The Trump administration sanctioned PDVSA to dry up oil revenues keeping the government and country afloat. (Petroleum sales provide more than 95 percent of Venezuela’s export earnings.) The Trump administration also turned Venezuelan state property over to the nascent Guaidó “government.”

Unfortunately, tougher economic controls are unlikely to force the regime to yield. Reducing the Maduro regime’s money will hurt it, but probably not enough to cripple it. Sanctions also will reduce funds available for the Venezuelan public, since the government controls most trade. However, Maduro and his allies will take care of themselves first. Complained Jose Bodas, an anti-Maduro union leader: “The rich will not stop getting richer, it’s the workers who will shoulder the cost of these measures.”

Starving the already suffering, whose vigorous opposition so far has failed to budge the regime, in hopes of fomenting a more effective uprising is a dubious strategy on both practical and moral grounds. Luis Vicente Leon, who heads the political consulting firm Datanalisis, said: “If this strategy isn’t successful quickly, the effect on the people will be devastating.” Unsurprisingly, eight of ten Venezuelans oppose U.S. sanctions.

Washington hopes that Maduro’s backers will end his reign, but their survival is tied to his. Most importantly, the military leadership, which Chávez transformed after the short-lived coup against him in 2002, has prospered along with the regime. Even if the Chavista elite decided to send Maduro packing, there is no reason to believe it would hand the keys to the kingdom to Guaidó or organize free elections.

Regime fractures might lead to civil war, with multiple contending factions. The outcome is impossible to predict. Although Guaidó unexpectedly unified the highly fractious opposition, he leans toward the socialist end of the economic spectrum. Some groups on the right complain that his Popular Will party is a member of the Socialist International. A bloody collapse might satisfy the Trump administration but could intensify the suffering of the Venezuelan population.

If the administration fails to oust Maduro through diplomacy and sanctions, it will suffer a major public relations embarrassment. Warned Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes: “Chest-thumping declarations that melt away over time weaken American power and credibility.” But Washington has no apparent alternative if the Maduro regime doesn’t fold. Worried Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue: “My concern is whether they’ve boxed themselves in.” An impasse would encourage the president to act militarily.

Yet nothing justifies war. Vice President Mike Pence recently declared that “For the sake of our vital interests, and for the sake of the Venezuelan people, America will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.” However, what vital American interest can he identify? There is none.

Admiral Craig Faller, head of the United State Southern Command, announced that “We are prepared to protect U.S. lives and protect the diplomatic facility in Venezuela.” However, Washington is keeping American diplomats on station as an explicit provocation. The Maduro government ordered U.S. personnel home, but the administration refused to comply. Washington may hope for an incident to justify military action. There also has been talk of using American military forces to move humanitarian aid into Venezuela, daring the Maduro government to block the effort. This would constitute the foreign policy equivalent of entrapment, enticing Caracas to take a step providing a casus belli.

Moreover, Fernando Cutz, who formerly served on the staff of the National Security Council, argued: “I don’t think you can underestimate the threat of a failed state very close to our borders.” Venezuela’s crisis certainly is bad for the country’s South American neighbors. However, the United States would hardly notice. Would millions of refugees swim the Caribbean and overrun Florida? Would al-Qaeda set up shop in anarchic Caracas? War-happy American officials routinely claim “vital interests” where none exist.

The Venezuelan people are suffering, but so are the peoples of Eritrea, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, and many more nations. Ironically, Washington supports, aids, and comforts the oppressor in several of these cases. In others, the Trump administration simply ignores friends acting badly. Nothing occurring in Venezuela justifies America embarking upon another war of choice.

Fear that the administration is inclined toward war caused Senate Democrats to insist that any resolution backing Guaidó include explicit disapproval of U.S. military action. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) refused the accept the measure with such a prohibition. “The U.S. always reserves the right on use force and protect its own national security interest and the interest of its personnel. So anything that would run counter to that would be problematic.” But he is being disingenuous since he routinely treats military action as a first resort.

Venezuela’s Guaidó suggested that he might come to welcome, even “authorize,” U.S. military action, though that “is not the form we hope for and believe in.” He also suggested that all options are on the table, the standard mantra of American officials who threaten war, and later argued that if the Maduro government blocked delivery of outside aid, that military intervention would be warranted under the UN “responsibility to protect” doctrine. However, as Representative Ro Khanna (D-Ca.) responded: “Mr. Guaidó, you can proclaim yourself leader of Venezuela but you don’t get to authorize U.S. military interventions. Only the U.S. Congress can do that. We will not.” And it should not.

Initiating another war of choice simply because the United States could do so would further unbalance American foreign policy. These days policymakers find it difficult to resist the temptation to use America’s overwhelming military power even though consequences are routinely ill. War should be a genuine last resort.

Secretary of State and later President John Quincy Adams appeared to foresee our world when he warned Americans not to go “abroad, in search of monsters to destroy” lest they risk their nation’s soul. The U.S. “might become the dictatress of the world” and “be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.” Which would be too high a price to pay.

The president appears to believe that an invasion would be easy, last year arguing that “It’s a regime that frankly could be toppled very quickly by the military, if the military decides to do that.” But believing the next war to be a cakewalk is a far too common mistake made by overly-optimistic political leaders. Most wars turn out far different and more costly than expected. For instance, in 1812 House Speaker Henry Clay declared that conquering Canada would be “a mere matter of marching.” More than two centuries later, of course, America’s northern neighbor remains free.

The only recent Latin American precedent was the 1989 invasion of Panama. However, circumstances were significantly different: a much smaller nation, ruled by a dictator with little popular backing, containing the U.S.-constructed canal long controlled by Washington. American troops already were stationed there, and the local government had killed several U.S. civilians.

The Maduro regime obviously would lose any conflict. Its armed services have suffered from years of economic crisis. Chávez purged potentially dissident officers in order to coup-proof the military, meaning trustworthiness trumped competence. Moreover, the army became a source of patronage and bulges with useless generals.

Nevertheless, there are capable units—special forces, airborne, and counter-insurgency, for instance. Admiral Faller told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Venezuelan military, though a “degraded force,” nevertheless “remains loyal to Maduro—and that makes it dangerous.” Moreover, the civil militia has an official membership of 1.6 million. Just last month 86 percent of Venezuelans said they opposed foreign military action. Invaders might not find themselves hailed as liberators even by those hoping for an end to Maduro’s misrule.

Urban resistance could prove difficult to quell, especially by soldiers dispersed into guerrilla units. Resistance also could turn into a civil war, further inflaming social divisions which would make fixing Venezuela even tougher. Having broken Venezuela with an invasion, America would feel great pressure to occupy and rebuild it.

Through this process, the Chavistas might shift blame for their misrule onto their new occupiers. Washington would own the results of its war. American support would undermine the new government’s legitimacy. And ousting Maduro would not resolve the underlying political conflicts which triggered Chávez’s rise. Overall, the costs of exercising the military option are obvious; the benefits less so.

Unfortunately, as time passes Washington appears to have another potential foreign policy debacle in the making. Guaidó’s announcement led to expectations of a speedy denouement: sanctions would crush the regime, military elites would defect and defenestrate Maduro, Chavista elites would accept the offer of amnesty and depart, and a new regime would emerge, fulfilling American objectives. Increasingly a peaceful U.S. victory appears unlikely.

Alas, no one, it seems, has an alternative approach. Reported Bloomberg: “U.S. policymakers and those around Guaidó—as well as leaders in Brazil and Colombia—are eying one another and worrying about failure. Officials in each camp have said privately they assumed the others had a more developed strategy.”

Evidently not. The situation would have the makings of comedy sitcom if the stakes weren’t so high. So now what?

Washington should lower its expectations and step back, leaving regime transformation to Venezuelans and their neighbors. Most important, President Trump should keep the troops at home. Simón Bolívar, the heroic revolutionary who liberated Venezuela from Spain, long ago intoned: “when tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right.” But in this case, that right should be exercised by Venezuelans, not Americans.",America Shouldn't Invade Venezuela,Cato.org,https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/america-shouldnt-invade-venezuela

As Nigerians go to the polls today to elect their next president and representatives in the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured them that the votes they cast will determine the outcome of the elections.

The chairman of the commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, gave the assurance while speaking at the fifth and final briefing of the media and observers since the postponement of the elections last Saturday.

Yakubu had earlier noted that recommendations by international observers in the previous elections were being implemented, saying the adoption of Simultaneous Accreditation and Voting System for today's election is part of them.

He stated that the commission would continue with the system of simultaneous accreditation and voting which it used in the conduct of the 194 off-season elections, adding that it is now part of the election guidelines.

While calling on Nigerians to conduct themselves peacefully, Yakubu said the commission had no favourite candidates in the elections, adding that only people with Permanent Voter's Cards (PVCs) will vote.

... It's D-Day For PMB, Atiku, Others

... Battleground states identified

Today is the long awaited day that both Nigerians and the international community have been looking forward to for the country to choose its next political leaders at the federal level.

Millions of Nigerians will vote today to elect a president, 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives.

In effect, it is D-Day for President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the two main contenders for the nation's top job.

Political analysts are of the view that today's elections will be the most keenly contested in the history of the country.

There is heightened anxiety following the one-week postponement of the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last week. As a result the presidential and the National Assembly elections hold today while governorship, State Assembly and FCT Area Council elections come up on March 9.

A call election by this newspaper a fortnight ago had tipped President Buhari to win the election handily with 60 per cent of the vote, with a five per cent margin of error in the prediction.

In the just concluded presidential campaigns, the two major candidates campaigned vigorously across the country. The president exceeded all expectations, campaigning across the 36 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), despite concerns raised about his health.

The opposition had earlier called on the president to resign because of his of purported Ill-health.

Hinged on the slogan, 'Next Level', President Buhari's campaign was premised on his 2015 promises - fighting corruption, reviving the economy and addressing security matters.

On the other hand, Atiku Abubakar released a policy document with a focus on 'getting Nigeria working again', which is his official slogan.

It is worthy of note that, unlike in 2015, the political temperature is mild and the reasons are not far-fetched. In 2015, the presidential poll was seen as a contest between the North and the South, but in today's election, both Buhari and Atiku are Northerners, Muslims and Fulanis. Both candidates are also septuagenarians.

Tension caused by religion and ethnicity, the country's fault lines usually exacerbated by politicians for selfish gains, is missing in the election, translating to fewer cases of violence, threats and counter threats by the major actors now unlike in 2015.

The strengths of President Buhari are integrity and character, popularity among the Northern masses, frugality with state resources, infrastructural achievements and trustworthiness.

On the other hand, Buhari's weaknesses are allegations of allowing a cabal hijack his government, poor handling of the economy, allegations of cronyism and nepotism, poor handling of the farmers/herdsmen clashes and allegations of one-sided anti-corruption fight.

The strong points to Atiku candidacy are his supposed knowledge of the economy; that he is successful businessman; that he has the ability to assembly a crack team, and that he is a known restructuring advocate, which resonates with a large number of Nigerians.

However, he is seen as weak on corruption, will run an elitist government, has trust issues, and that he carries PDP baggage of looting the economy into recession.

A total of 72,775,502 million Nigerians have collected their PCVs in the 36 states and the FCT. With 774 local government areas and 2,642 political wards in the country where voting will take place, the 2019 general elections in Nigeria will be the largest election on the African continent.

Before last Saturday's postponement of the election, INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, had announced that 73 presidential candidates would be in the ballot, but two days ago 12 of them withdrew from the race and gave their support to the incumbent, President Buhari.

In terms of voting population based on the number of PVCs collected, LEADERSHIP Weekend reports that among the six geo-political zones of the country, North-West leads, followed by South-West, North-Central, South-South, North-East and South-East in that order.

Checks show that Buhari and Atiku will have a keen battle in Lagos, Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Oyo, Ogun, Bauchi, Delta, Rivers and Plateau states, which are the states with the highest number of voters.

In Yobe State, it was gathered that some may not vote because of threats of attacks by the Boko Haram terrorists.

A report released by the Election Analysis Centre of the Centre for Democracy Development said attacks by armed bandits might threaten the conduct of the elections in Kaduna State, even though the state governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has said that the state is safe for election to take place.

In Kwara State, the activities of thugs and hoodlums which have led to the killing of people in recent times have been identified as a major threat to the election in certain areas while in Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states, vote buying could pose a serious setback to the process.

It was gathered that there will be serious battle for votes especially in Lagos State which has the highest number of PVCs collected.

Observers said Lagos, which has been a state for keen contests in both in the gubernatorial and the presidential elections since 1999, would witness a similar incident in the 2019 general elections. While many believe it will be a smooth ride for the APC, others argue that the factionalisation of the APC in the state, coupled with the fact that the incumbent governor was denied a return ticket might tell on APC votes.

Kano State has always been a nest of bulk support for President Muhammadu Buhari, with the status of second largest voting population in the country. However, with former Kano State governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso moving to the PDP with his multitude of supporters in the Kwakwansiya Movement, it may not be plain sailing for President Buhari this time around.

It is believed that Buhari who won Kaduna and Katsina states last time is likely to retain the states even thought there might be an incursion by the PDP candidate, especially some groups in the two states that were not happy with the federal appointments made by the present administration.

In Oyo State, the APC is likely to take the day by some fractions while Plateau State is likely to go according to the yearnings of the Northern minorities.

But after thorough deliberations lasting several hours, analysts at the Centre of Democracy and Development's Election Analysis Centre (EAC) have suggested 10 key states which will play a significant role in shaping who becomes Nigeria's next president.

These states are Lagos, Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Oyo, Ogun, Bauchi, Delta, Rivers and Plateau.

These battleground states were chosen because they have historically turned out high number of voters and they currently have large numbers of registered voters for this year's elections.

To decide which state fits into the pool for consideration, the analysts deployed factors like the total number of registered voters, voter turnout in the last general elections in 2015, established voting patterns and the current political situation in the state, relying on factors such as internal crisis, unresolved grievances and show of power between political heavyweights in the state.

Meanwhile, the analysts also pointed out that there are few hidden factors that are likely influence the outcome of the presidential elections.

They said areas experiencing insecurity might witness low voter turnout and this might affect candidates who have such areas as their strongholds.

Additionally, they cautioned that even though the South East has the least number of registered voters, the combined votes of people from the Igbo ethnic group across the country could overshadow some states put together since Igbos are highly dispersed across several states in the country.

They argued that other candidates like Prof. Kingsley Moghalu of the Young People's Party (YPP) and Omoyele Sowere of the African Action Congress (AAC) might influence the outcome of the elections since they would certainly secure some votes at the expense of either Atiku or Buhari.

IGP Orders Watertight Security, Says Offenders Will Be Prosecuted

As part of the security cover for today's presidential and National Assembly elections, the acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered robust security arrangements in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

He also reiterated his earlier stand that those who engage in electoral malpractice would be arrested and prosecuted.

Force spokesman, Frank Mba, said that the Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) in the 12 zonal commands and the commissioners of police (CPs) in the 36 state commands and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) had also been directed by the IGP to beef up security in their respective areas and to work closely with the senior police officers deployed on election duty to the three senatorial districts and form part of security management base for each state.

The IGP has also directed the Election Intelligence Monitoring Team (EIMT) to intensify constant surveillance, intelligence gathering and monitoring of security personnel deployed nationwide while the Special Election Investigation Team (SEIT) should ensure discrete investigation of electoral cases and diligent prosecution of all electoral offenders.

While charging all security personnel on election duty to ensure they remain patriotic, professional, unbiased and apolitical in the discharge of their duties, the IGP however warned that he would not tolerate any form of impunity or unethical conduct on the part of any officer.

He further reiterated that on no account should any policeman or woman attached to VIPs be seen escorting their principal to the polling unit or moving around with them on the day of election, saying any police officer caught would be arrested and dealt with accordingly.

The IGP advised politicians to prevail on their supporters to be orderly, law abiding and shun all forms of violence and electoral malpractices before, during and after the polls.

The IGP, who had earlier banned voters from wearing party logos and shouting party slogans at polling units in today's presidential and the National Assembly elections, added that there is maximum security in place to protect voters, INEC officials, observers, journalists and other stakeholders that would be engaged in the elections.

The police has also said it would arrest unaccredited security operative and VIPs moving from one place to another during voting hours, adding that the Force had made provisions for three security personnel per polling unit.

According Adamu, no VIP is allowed to move from one polling unit to another with security personnel without tags during the voting hours.

While promising that his officers will abide by the provisions of the Electoral Act and the code of conduct for the election, the acting IGP said they should always seek clearance from INEC before taking actions during the election.

""We have done a threat analysis of the whole country. Flash points have been mapped out. Individuals or groups that may likely cause mayhem have already been identified and will be monitored,"" he said.

The police boss has also directed the deputy inspectors general of police (DIGs) already deployed to the six geo-political zones of the country to ensure adequate security presence, coordination, supervision and implementation of security strategies for the election in all polling units, Registration Area Centres (RACs), super RACs, collation centres, INEC offices, government and critical national infrastructure, and flashpoints across the states of the federation.

U.S., Canada, ECOWAS urge Nigerians to make Saturday's elections peaceful, credible

U.S. President Donald Trump's top foreign policy adviser, Ambassador John Bolton, has urged Nigerians to ensure that today's elections are peaceful.

Bolton said this in a tweet by the U.S. Embassy in its twitter account @USEmbassyAbuja accessed by the News Agency of Nigeria yesterday in Abuja.

The National Security Adviser of the United States also called on all the candidates in the election to accept the results.

""To all Nigerians working to ensure elections on Saturday are peaceful, free, fair, and credible, we wish you success.

""We urge every voter to participate and every candidate to peacefully accept the election results,"" Bolton said.

In the same vein, Canadian High Commission in Nigeria also advised all Nigerians to go out on Saturday and vote.

The High Commission, in its twitter account @CanHCNigeria, said Nigerians would decide their future through free, fair and credible polls.

""Remember! We encourage all Nigerians to exercise their democratic rights to go out and vote tomorrow.

""You will decide Nigeria's future and deserve a free, fair, credible and peaceful chance to do it.""

Also, the ECOWAS Election Observer Mission has commended Nigerians for their patience and calm following the postponement of the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on February 16.

The head of the mission, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirfleaf, at a news briefing in Abuja yesterday, said the international community had watched the progress INEC had made to address the challenges it faced.

Johnson-Sirleaf said the progress made by the commission signalled a ""deepening and building of confidence in the electoral processes"".

""We extend thanks, admiration and gratitude to the Nigerian people for their patience in the face of the last-minute interruptions to their lives with the postponement of the 2019 general elections.

""We have watched the progress of INEC over the past week working together with domestic and international partners in addressing their logistical and technical challenges.

""We are pleased that these operational constraints have been significantly addressed towards a conducive atmosphere for tomorrow's general elections.

""We commend our brothers and sisters across the length and breadth of this great country for remaining calm and resilient as these concerns were addressed,"" she said.

Sirleaf also commended political leaders for signing the 2019 Peace Accord and described it as a further demonstration of the commitment of Nigeria to democracy.

She expressed confidence that the same level of maturity would be demonstrated during the remaining phase of the electoral process.

""We applaud Nigeria for the pivotal role it played in maintaining peace and the restoration of democracy in our sub-region,"" she added.

The head of mission also urged political leaders and Nigerians to continue to maintain peace and adhere to the rule of law during the rest of the electoral process.

Furthermore, she commended the security forces in maintaining the peace and protection of the electorate, local and international observers.",Nigeria: Votes Will Count - INEC Chairman,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902230036.html

0 SHARES Email

Bernie Sanders announced his second shot at the presidency of the United States last Tuesday. In 2016, he lost to the then-candidate Hillary Clinton in a close contest that pitted ‘big money’ against ‘big people’. Later it was discovered that the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the organisation that oversees the nomination of the Democratic party, had heavily favoured Clinton when they were supposed to stay neutral.

This left a sense of unfinished business for Sanders’ supporters who felt cheated by the DNC. Big money won that time, but this time it’s different. After announcing his run for presidency, Sanders has been able to collect over $4 million in 10 hours from small donations sent by the people. There is a new sense of optimism in his campaign and Sanders is hoping to get a million volunteers to create the largest grassroots political movement in the US.

I'm running for president. I am asking you to join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least 1 million people from across the country. Say you're in: https://t.co/KOTx0WZqRf pic.twitter.com/T1TLH0rm26 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 19, 2019

The politics in Pakistan are different from the US but we can definitely learn a thing or three from the 77-year-old, self-proclaimed democratic socialist. Below are some of the things that Sanders supports which should be followed by Pakistani politicians (looking at you, PM IK):

Campaign finance reform

Sanders believes that a politician can never work for the people if he accepts money from big businesses and large interest groups. For example, pharmaceutical companies. The United States has one of the most expensive medical drugs in the world. Comparing it to their neighbour Canada, the US charges three times more for the same drugs. This is because of the lobbying done by pharmaceutical companies that donate to politicians and keep the drug prices high.

Our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country. We must restore the Voting Rights Act, overturn Citizens United, end voter suppression and gerrymandering, make Election Day a holiday and move to public funding of elections. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 23, 2019

In Pakistan, political parties do not publicly disclose their donations entirely. The money that is funding our politicians can come from anywhere and there’s no transparency. It could come from the tobacco industry that wants to lower regulation and it could come from large corporations who want lower taxes for their incomes. Pakistan needs campaign finance reform that shows the people who exactly is funding our politicians. Otherwise, we may unknowingly be helping out big corporations and voting for their hidden agendas that we may not support.

Free college and universities

Under Sanders’ policy, the United States would have free public colleges and universities that teach students without the pressure of student loan debts.

The public education system in Pakistan is not the greatest. Brilliant students may never get to shine because of our lack of sufficient education policies or opportunities. As we know the state of public schools in Pakistan, one can only imagine the state of public universities in our country. One solution would be subsidising the fee of low-income students for existing universities in our country. That way we will have the benefits of private universities without the burden of it being run by the government.

I’m running for president because we must extend the concept of public education beyond the 12th grade and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. Every young person, regardless of the income of his or her family, should have the opportunity to attend college. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 24, 2019

Higher taxation on the rich

I believe this may be the most important policy that helps the country combat income inequality. With Sanders’ proposal to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations, countries can fight for 99% of the people, instead of just the top 1%. For example, the largest company, Amazon, pays $0 in federal tax. This will hopefully change greatly under Sanders.

$25,149. That's how much the Walton family of Walmart makes in a single MINUTE—more than the average Walmart worker makes in an entire year. Instead of austerity for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and massive corporations. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 24, 2019

In Pakistan, we are reducing the taxes for corporations and big businesses but are still increasing sales tax which affects the common people of Pakistan. The corporate tax is being reduced to 29% (2019) as compared to 35% (2012). The sales tax has increased by 1% during the same time (17% in 2019). This means the rich are paying less and the poor are increasingly paying a higher proportion of taxes in their income.

These basic changes can help transform Pakistan and bring transparency to our elections, to our politics and help the people of this country. More policies such as free healthcare would reduce inequality and remove the burden off the poor who are being hit by sudden health costs. Focusing on climate change and renewable energy would reduce our reliance on oil and gas that has tormented this country for decades. Increasing the minimum wage could help transform the lives of the low-wage worker and help stimulate the economy. Low-income families spend more money on necessities, while the rich save their money in banks that only accumulate interest. Giving money to the poor through economic policies will help stimulate the economy and make it work for every Pakistani.

For too long the power shift in Pakistan has been disproportionately in favour of the rich. Following Sander’s policies could help bring change to Pakistan and make it a country not just for the top 1% but for the rest of the 99%.

However, when looking at the current political field that Pakistan has, it’s hard to personally distinguish between politicians, political parties and individuals who are running for government. If you watch closely and pay attention to the current political climate of Pakistani politicians, you will not see a battle of ideas or policies. Instead you will see a battle of personalities, and our choice (unfortunately) lies on who is the least corrupt politician. It might take time for Pakistan to find a real democratic socialist like Sanders but with the introduction of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the government breaking the two-party system, we can hope for new ideas and more options in policies in the future.",3 lessons Pakistani politicians can learn from Bernie Sanders,Tribune.com.pk,https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/79216/3-lessons-pakistani-politicians-can-learn-from-bernie-sanders/
73,Empty,2019-02-22T22:30:37Z,Quebec has edged closer to increased hydroelectric power exports to Massachusetts after Maine’s new governor signed onto a deal to get a transmission corridor built.,"Quebec has edged closer to increased hydroelectric power exports to Massachusetts after Maine’s new governor signed onto a deal to get a transmission corridor built.

Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who won office in the U.S. mid-term elections in November, said Maine would get $258 million in benefits over 40 years in exchange for a permit to send the power from Canada to Massachusetts, the New England state's Press Herald reported this week.

""Excellent news for Quebec! Hydro-Québec will be able to export more electricity to Massachusetts via Maine,"" Premier François Legault wrote on Twitter in response to the report.

Excellente nouvelle pour le Québec!

Hydro-Québec pourra exporter davantage d'électricité au Massachusetts en passant par le Maine. https://t.co/kB1CyDHm0E — François Legault (@francoislegault) February 21, 2019

Quebec gets most of the electricity for its own use from hydroelectric sources and seeks to increase exports of excess capacity. Quebec has said it would provide Maine with $40 million financing for the proposed project.

Hydro-Québec is an energy giant that is wholly-owned by the province and already sends 40 per cent of its exports to New England.

In June, Hydro-Québec reached agreement with three utility companies to supply Massachusetts with 9.45 terawatt hours of electricity for 20 years beginning in 2022.

But the deal depends on getting the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission line approved, after New Hampshire energy regulators last April quashed the Northern Pass project, which would have transported power from Quebec through to Massachusetts.

As part of the deal, the operator of the planned transmission line, Central Maine Power Company (CMP), said it would provide $258 million to Maine over 40 years to help lower electricity bills, advance clean-energy efforts, and fund other public and community benefits, according to a filing dated Feb. 21 and published by the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

Decision due in early March

Central Maine Power joined a string of public and community groups to file a pledge to the commission that the project addresses a ""public need"" and is in the public interest and therefore should be allowed to proceed.

It argues that the project will lower electricity bills in Maine, protect against price volatility related to natural gas markets, replace retiring baseload capacity, and help boost electric vehicle expansion in the state.

The parties to the hearing may respond until March 1, with a hearing scheduled March 7, when a decision from the commission on whether to allow the project to proceed is expected.

Critics of the NECEC argue that construction of the transmission line will not benefit Maine citizens, as they are not the recipients of the hydroelectricity and the construction of the line may damage the local landscape.

The proposed path of the transmission line means that a 150-foot-wide clear-cut path must pass through about 84 kilometres of the North Woods to connect to the Central Maine Power Company’s existing corridors.

Construction of the 230-km high-voltage NECEC line is expected to cost $1.2 billion, Central Maine Power says, and would provide 1,200 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity from Quebec through Maine to Massachusetts.

While hydroelectric power -- which is created from the downhill flow of water -- is renewable and does not emit greenhouse gases it often requires the construction of dams and reservoirs that disrupt water flows and damage populations.

CMP said it would ultimately transfer ownership of the line to NECEC Transmission LLC, another company owned by Avangrid Networks, CMP's parent company, and that the operating entity would in turn pay it $60 million in equal annual payments for 40 years starting when the project is operational.",Hydro-Québec expansion edges closer as Maine governor signs on,Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/22/news/hydro-quebec-expansion-edges-closer-maine-governor-signs

Cattle ranchers in Australia are using solar-powered ear tags to keep track of their herds, connecting through LoRa technology to locate their bulls, cows, heifers, and steers. SODAQ of the Netherlands and Lacuna Space of the U.K. are providing the Internet of Things technology and satellite-based LoRa connectivity to make this possible. “The main differentiator for LoRa over the other competing low-power, low-bandwidth, and long-range protocol standards for the Internet of Things is that it is the only one where you can build out a network from scratch without relying on any third-party providers,” Alasdair Allan, a technology researcher and consultant in Exeter, England, says in this article.

University of Glasgow researchers report development of solar-powered flexible supercapacitors suitable to function as power sources for advanced wearable devices. The team alternated layers of graphene and polyurethane to create a low-cost, flexible supercapacitor that passes solar power from the top layer to underlying storage surfaces. This supercapacitor design can provide 2.5 volts of power output, significantly greater than the 1 volt or lower output with previous supercapacitors.

LG Electronics has integrated Amazon Dash functionality into its Wi-Fi connected smart appliances for the home.

A hacking group associated with Russian intelligence services attacked a number of civil society organizations in Europe, ahead of elections in May for the European Parliament and national elections in European countries, according to Microsoft. Among the groups attacked were the German Council on Foreign Relations, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and the European offices of the Aspen Institute. Microsoft blamed the attacks on the group known as Fancy Bear, which was involved in the 2016 cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee, according to the party and security researchers. “Today we’re announcing the expansion of Microsoft AccountGuard to twelve new markets across Europe, providing comprehensive threat detection and notification to eligible organizations at no additional cost and customized help to secure their systems,” Microsoft’s Tom Burt, corporate vice president, customer security and trust, wrote Wednesday in a blog post.

CrowdStrike reports that Russian hackers are eight times faster than their counterparts in China, Iran, and North Korea, and even among cybercriminals. Meanwhile, the National Security Agency and FireEye say Chinese and Iranian hackers are targeting American businesses and government agencies in the wake of the U.S. pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 and the Trump administration’s trade war with China. Boeing, General Electric Aviation, and T-Mobile have seen Chinese industrial-espionage efforts aimed at their operations, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing. The renewed cyberespionage comes after the Obama administration was able in 2015 to get the Chinese to scale back their probing for trade secrets among American companies.

This week in Huawei – British cybersecurity officials do not support a full and total ban of telecommunications equipment provided by the Chinese company, Reuters reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Allowing Huawei to supply next-generation networking systems, especially for 5G cellular communications, to the United Kingdom could have an impact on the working relations of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing group of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the United States, since the U.S. has urged other countries to boycott Huawei products made in China. The Wall Street Journal reports that Germany may allow Huawei to continue doing business there. Meanwhile, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei told the BBC that the U.S. stance on alleged cybersnooping by China and Huawei is “politically motivated” and led to the Dec. 1 arrest of his daughter, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, who is detained in Canada; the U.S. has formally requested her extradition to the States. The U.S. Department of Justice denies that there are any political considerations in the detention of Meng.

For all the attention Huawei Technologies is getting in the media, Cisco Systems CEO Chuck Robbins says his company is competitive with Huawei in Asian and European markets. “We haven’t seen any material impact from all of the noise in the system around this topic,” he said in an interview with CNBC. “If you look at the numbers and you look at our service provider business in both Europe and Asia, where we compete with them, they were both positive. So, we were able to compete.”

Tony Bradley, Alert Logic’s senior manager of content marketing and editor-in-chief of TechSpective, writes about Armorblox, a new company that incorporates natural language processing in its cybersecurity platform.

Nest Labs is requiring owners of its security cameras to change their passwords, claiming there are too many insecure passwords that could lead to data breaches. Nest users are locked out of their accounts until they complete the password change. The Google subsidiary says the move is motivated by recent hacks of the security cameras, not Nest’s security protocols.

More than 70 companies have entered the AI chip market in recent years, and about 100 AI chip startups have formed. That’s not including all those in full stealth mode. Many of these companies are aiming their efforts at advanced computing for autonomous vehicles. “A specialized AI chip market has emerged to create platforms that can perform these complex computations almost instantaneously, while using as little power as possible,” writes Bibhrajit Halder, CEO of an early-stage AV startup. Nvidia, Google, and Graphcore are leading contenders in this field, he notes. “Roughly 12–15 companies are pulling ahead with their next-generation AI chips, but solidifying a lead will require producing and scaling them as well, which could favor established players or motivate smaller companies to merge with larger ones, as Nervana Systems and Intel did,” Halder concludes.

Honda Motor this week said it plans to shut down its plant in Swindon, England, by 2021, putting 3,500 workers in jeopardy of losing their jobs. “In light of the unprecedented changes that are affecting our industry, it is vital that we accelerate our electrification strategy and restructure our global operations accordingly,” Katsushi Inoue, the chief officer for European operations, said in a statement. The British government expressed its disappointment with the decision, which is apparently unrelated to the Brexit tribulations. “The U.K. is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now,” Business Secretary Greg Clark said. Swindon has Honda’s only plant in the European Union, and the Japanese manufacturer is also planning to shutter its production facility in Turkey within two years. “Honda’s move doesn’t speak well of global growth and at the very least, raises a yellow flag about the automotive market over the next few years,” Bret Kenwell writes in this analysis. While Honda and other mass-market manufacturers may be headed for the exits as the Brexit deadline looms, many of England’s luxury automotive manufacturers, such as Aston Martin, Bentley Motors (part of the Volkswagen Group), McLaren Automotive, and Rolls-Royce, are nonchalant at the prospect of leaving the EU. Their vehicles command six-figure prices, and they are unlikely to feel much financial pain over the breakup, although Jaguar Land Rover, now owned by Tata Motors of India, is eliminating 5,000 jobs in its workforce of 40,000.

Amazon’s investments in Rivian Automotive and Aurora Innovation show the e-commerce giant’s embrace of automated driving technology, which potentially could help the company deliver its ever-growing stream of packages, without relying upon FedEx, UPS, or the U.S. Postal Service. In 2018, Amazon ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans to bolster its own delivery fleet. Those vans run on diesel fuel, however. “For Amazon, this small investment is a good way to enlarge their bet on the E.V. automotive market without having to tool up a plant to find out if it will fly,” said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor of Kelley Blue Book. “Over time, the Rivian investment could give Amazon a starting point to own and operate an in-house package delivery business.”

Arm this week brought out the Arm Neoverse N1 platform, optimized for 7-nanometer process technology and aimed at use in cloud workloads, and the Arm Neoverse E1 platform, described by the company as a high-efficiency throughput platform. “We are moving from an Internet model that distributes video (Netflix and YouTube) to one that consumes, manages, and processes information produced at the edge. When you consider these factors, and the end of Moore’s Law, the days of one-size-fits-all computing are over. We are entering a new era driven by a greater diversity of specialized compute and the need for flexible architectures tailored to meet application-specific needs,” Drew Henry, senior vice president and general manager, Infrastructure Line of Business, wrote in a blog post.

Rambus announced the availability of its 32G Multi-protocol SerDes PHY intellectual property on the 22-nanometer fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (22FDX) platform of GlobalFoundries.

It is meant for high-speed applications in data centers, wireless 5G infrastructure, and wireline communications.

Synopsys says its automotive Grade 1 temperature DesignWare Foundation, Analog, and Interface IP is being developed for the GF 22FDX platform. Avi Bauer, vice president of R&D at Arbe, said in a statement, “We need to work with leading companies who can support our technology innovation. GF’s 22FDX technology, with Synopsys automotive-grade DesignWare IP, will help us meet automotive reliability and operation requirements and is critical to our success.” Meanwhile, Synopsys stated that its Fusion Design Platform was used by Samsung Foundry to tape out its gate-all-around system-on-a-chip test chip, comprising several high-performance, multi-core subsystems. “Samsung Foundry has achieved many industry firsts in our drive to deliver differentiated process technology offerings to our comprehensive customer base. The latest tape-out, our GAA test chip, provides further validation of our continued commitment,” Jaehong Park, executive vice president of Design Platform Development at Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.

Lyft reportedly may float its initial public offering in early April, getting out ahead of Uber’s IPO, The New York Times reports, citing two people familiar with the company’s plans. The company’s roadshow, making presentations to prospective investors, may commence during the week of March 18th.

Meanwhile, the Uber IPO is seen taking longer for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review, given the variety of businesses it is in, aside from ride-hailing services, such as development of autonomous vehicle technology. The company’s unprofitability may give pause to some investors. Uber reported its net revenue for 2018 came to $11.3 billion, a 43% gain from 2017. In the fourth quarter of last year, the company posted net revenue of $3 billion and a net loss of $865 million. It had $6.4 billion in cash at the end of 2018.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The US Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as US Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the oil-rich nation. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as US-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

Washington wants the 15-member UN Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup against the OPEC member.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the US Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

Overview: The global capital markets are winding down what appears to be an inconclusive week quietly and on a mixed note. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is poised to snap a four-day advance but held on to a nearly 2% gain for the week. European bourses are mostly higher, and although the weekly advance of around 0.5% may not be that impressive, Dow Jones Stoxx 600 has only fallen in one of the first eight weeks of the year for a 9.5% year-to-date gain. Benchmark yields are mostly one-two basis points lower, with Australia and Italy the notable exceptions. The US dollar is confined to its well-worn ranges and is narrowly mixed. The Australian dollar has pared yesterday's losses amid efforts by officials to play down the disruption of coal exports to China. Sterling is a little heavier on the day, but it is holding on to a 1% gain for the week. A delay in both Brexit and an escalation of US-China tariffs looks increasingly likely.

Asia Pacific

Australia's Treasurer and the Governor of the Central Bank tried minimizing the significance of the disruption of coal exports to China. Reuters reported yesterday of the disruption, and the Australian dollar fell sharply. The slowdown of Australia's coal exports may have begun last month, and RBA Governor Lowe tried linking it to environment and profitability issues and not to the controversy over Huawei. It is difficult to know. China uses its commercial power to express its displeasure, and there is a lack of transparency. This ambiguity keeps China's adversary off-balance. Investors will be sensitive to data that shed light on these developments.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand warned that raising capital requirements for banks could, all else being equal, tighten financial conditions. This, in turn, could pressure the RBNZ to cut rates to offset this ""regulatory"" tightening. The RBNZ is proposing lifting the Tier 1 capital requirement to 16%, or nearly double current levels. A formal decision is expected in Q3.

Japan's underlying measures of inflation ticked up in January, though the headline was unchanged at 0.2%. Excluding fresh food, which is how Japan measures its core rate, rose 0.8%, up from 0.7% at the end of last year. The target is 2%. Excluding fresh food and energy, inflation rose to 0.4% from 0.3%.

The Australian dollar had tumbled from $0.7200 yesterday to about $0.7070. Despite the bearishness of the price action (outside down day), there has been no follow-through selling. The Aussie is consolidating in roughly a 20 tick range on either side of $0.7100. At the middle of the range, the Australian dollar is off about 0.5% this week. We suspect the bears to sell into additional gains that could extend to $0.7140. The dollar has risen against the yen in four sessions this week and is poised to close higher for the third consecutive week. That said, the range has been exceptionally narrow - JPY110.40-JPY110.95. Three-month implied volatility has broken down, and at below 6.2%, it is at a new five-year low today.

Europe

Reports suggest that EU officials expect the UK to ask for a three-month extension. Any longer would complicate the EU Parliamentary elections at the end of May. EU officials are likely to grant the extension after pressing the UK. The risk of a disruptive no-deal exit is scaring some policymakers, and as many as 100 Tory MPs are threatening to vote against May's bill next week to force a delay. Yesterday's EU-UK talks ended without a fresh agreement, but the talks will continue next week. There is some talk that both the UK and EU could issue parallel statements that show a more benign interpretation or expression of will that some think may be sufficient to bolster May's support.

Germany confirmed its practically flat Q4 GDP. The details were interesting. Consumption and investment rose (0.2% and 0.9%) respectively, but appeared to be offset by a decline in inventories, which, in turn, is tied to the auto sector. Many observers from debtor countries complain about Germany's near-permanent austerity, but the breakdown of GDP data showed that government spending surged in Q4 by 1.6%, the strongest since Q1 16. Separately, and disappointingly, Germany's IFO February survey showed no improvement in sentiment. The sense of the current climate eased to 98.5 from 99.3. Expects slipped to 93.8 from 94.3, the lowest since 2012. The overall assessment deteriorated to 103.4 from 104.5, a fresh two-year low.

The record from the recent ECB meeting boosted expectations that a new targeted long-term refinancing loan (TLTRO) will be announced next month, but the modalities or details might not be announced until later in Q2. The issue is not old loans are coming due this year, rather after the middle of the year, the previous four-year loans will have a year left. This puts them into a short-term financing bucket, and the banks are under regulatory pressure to minimize. In addition, if the loans are paid back, the ECB's balance sheet would shrink.

Thus far, the euro has been confined to a less than a quarter-cent range against the dollar. It closed last week a little below $1.13 and has closed every session this week above $1.13. The three-month implied vol has softened this week but around 6.3%, it is a little above the month's low (~6.2%), which itself was the lowest since late 2012. There is a large option (1.6 bln euros) struck at $1.13 that expires today. The euro looks trapped in a $1.1320-$1.1370 range. The sterling is trading at a three-day low near $1.30. The intraday technicals favor it holding. Three-month vol peaked early last December near 15%. It reached a low last month near 10% and is now near 11.4%. The prospects of a delay may be keeping the bears at bay, but this seems to be largely discounted, making near-term outlook difficult.

America

President Trump will reportedly meet with China's Vice Premier and point man in the trade talks Liu He. This is thought to help facilitate a meeting between Trump and Xi for next month. A Bloomberg survey found that nearly everyone polled did not expect tariffs to go up on March 1. However, 18 of the 29 do expect tariffs to go up eventually.

There is much press coverage of the report indicating that one of the things the US asks is a stable yuan. We suspect this is being blown out of proportion. First, it is not new or even controversial. The US has expressed this concern before, and Chinese officials say they too want a stable yuan. Second, the G7 and G20 have endorsed letting market forces determine exchange rates. Many observers see a contradiction between market forces determining exchange rates and the US wants China to have a stable yuan. However, the contradiction is more apparent than real. One gets to a stable currency not be intervening, but by pursuing balanced policies. Third, the fact that the US housing market remains nationalized or that the US recapitalized banks during the crisis, does not deter US officials from pressing China to reduce the role of the state in its economy, suggesting officials are not hampered cognitive dissonance.

After a slew of data yesterday, the US economic calendar turns quiet today, but headline risk is presented by around eight Fed officials speaking today. Investors learned this week that most officials favor ending the balance sheet operations this year, though a full rationale has not been delivered. On the other hand, there is still a subtle tightening bias as there was no apparent discussion of the conditions that would warrant a cut, but there was regarding a hike.

Canada reports retail sales. They likely declined for the second month, and when autos are excluded, sales probably fell for the fourth month. Yesterday's comments from Governor Poloz suggested that while the central bank's normalization is not over, it is in no hurry to continue it by hiking rates. The Canadian dollar fell every week, but one in Q4 18 and is the strongest major currency this year with a 3% advance. It has only fallen one week this year, but this week's gain of a less than 0.25% could be under risk if the retail sales are disappointing. Note that there is an option for a little more than $500 mln at CAD1.3215 that expires today and the greenback is hovering around it in the European morning.

On 24 February, Moldovans are due to vote in parliamentary elections. Except the current government – which the World Bank has recently described as “captured by oligarchic interests” – is trying to prevent some of its electorate from voting. Indeed, there are reports of people who work state institutions being threatened that if they don’t give their votes to the ruling Democratic Party, they will lose their jobs. As the Democrats have never managed to get more than 20% of the vote, they instead rule by “converting” parliamentarians of other parties.

The biggest group that the government is concerned about, and trying to limit, is Moldova’s diaspora.

They have their reasons. According to some estimates, there are one million Moldovans living abroad – compared to the three million that still populate Europe’s poorest country.

In 2016, the Moldovan diaspora mobilised politically for the first time. Some 138,000 citizens outside Moldova went to polling stations to choose between Igor Dodon, leader of the pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists, and Maia Sandu, one of the two leaders of pro-EU accession opposition bloc ACUM.

Postal votes are not permitted in Moldova. So a few weeks before elections, a Facebook group called Adoptă Un Vot (“Adopt a Vote”) helped the diaspora organise. People offered free seats in their cars to others living in areas without polling stations; many living in big cities hosted those living further away. It was a moving moment for Moldovans abroad and at home. Some Moldovans travelled thousands of kilometers across the Americas, Central Asia and the Middle East to vote. For the first time in many years, there was hope for change.

Yet despite queueing for hours, thousands of Moldovans abroad (myself included) were unable to vote. Polling stations in Bucharest, Verona, Parma, Padua, Frankfurt, London, Dublin, Montreal and other cities ran out of ballot papers. Igor Dodon won the vote by a small margin, with 52% in the second round, and despite breaches of the electoral law cited by the opposition and civil society. But Moldovans in Europe and America voted in droves for Maia Sandu.

Queues outside a London polling station, November 2016. Source: UniMedia / Moldova.org.

Perhaps the diaspora’s support for Sandu and her political bloc ACUM is unsurprising: what the two share is a genuine anti-corruption sentiment and a vision for Moldova as a liberal prosperous state with a rule of law. And the diaspora’s broadly anti-oligarchic position is precisely why the current government has tried to limit their vote. How have they done that?

Firstly, following the 2016 election, the ruling Democratic Party, together with Dodon’s Party of Socialists, voted to change the electoral system from a proportional vote to a mixed one, whereby half of the 101 seats in Moldova’s Parliament are elected proportionally, and half – based on circumscription lists (local MPs). This change was introduced in disregard to specific recommendations by the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission.

The government has forbidden people from using out-of-date passports as voter identification. Yet most Moldovans in Europe, Canada and the US use Romanian passports or permanent residence papers to travel and work

Under this new arrangement, the diaspora only gets to decide three seats in Parliament – there is one MP for Europe, one MP for Russia and the East, and one MP for North America. This means that, if in the past the diaspora was able to influence the seats of 101 MPs, now they can only influence 53 seats. Moreover, the way the polling stations have been set in the US and Canada does not reflect the number of Moldovans living in specific cities. For instance, in Montreal, where in 2016 the ballot papers finished before all citizens queueing could vote, no poll station was opened.

Secondly, the government has forbidden people from using out-of-date passports as voter identification. Most Moldovans in Europe, Canada and the US use Romanian passports or permanent residence papers to travel and work. And many Moldovans voted with out-of-date passports in the 2010, 2014 and 2016 elections. In 2014, Moldova’s Supreme Court of Justice irrevocably and definitively decided that voting with an expired passport is legal. But a recently appointed Constitutional Court declared in mid-January that voting with expired passports in the diaspora is illegal. The reasons they invoked include preventing fraud and double voting. Yet the personal numeric code in a passport is unique, which means that the same person cannot vote twice. Likewise, observers in previous elections have not reported significant fraud at polling stations outside Moldova. Legal experts’ opinions vary on whether the Constitutional Court’s decision is binding for Moldova’s Central Electoral Committee.

While the Central Electoral Committee says that only 175 Moldovans voted with out-of-date passports abroad in 2016, the opposition bloc ACUM estimates there are currently 500,000 Moldovans living abroad with out-of-date papers. The truth is probably somewhere in between, and somewhere where it really matters. On the Adoptă Un Vot group, a Facebook poll said 263 people had valid passports and 132 had invalid passports. Similarly, diaspora Facebook group FreeMoldova states they have received over two hundred comments and questions about voting with out-of-date passports. If citizens living in Moldova with out-of-date or no ID can still get a temporary ID to vote, then in the diaspora this is impossible.

Despite these limitations, Moldovans abroad are still organising themselves online — Adoptă un Vot has now reached over 80,000 members. But in addition to this, a new diaspora movement has formed, FreeMoldova. This group started in June 2018, when the Moldova Supreme Court declared local election results in the capital Chișinău null, ruling that the winning candidate – Andrei Năstase, a leader of opposition bloc ACUM – breached the electoral code by encouraging people to vote in a Facebook Live video the day before elections. In the same period, young people in Chisinau organised the OccupyGuguță initiative, initially posed against the property development of an iconic city cafe. They have since made themselves known by distributing their own newspaper across the country and playing drums at protests, thus animating the more traditional top-down protest style in Moldova. Both groups are crowdfunded – a first for Moldova.

This month, members of FreeMoldova flew back to Moldova and, together with OccupyGuguță, are trying to inform people across the country of the changes in the electoral system, encouraging them to vote on 24 February without fear of intimidation. Mostly, they get very positive reactions. Along with the thanks and cheers for being active citizens, many Moldovans tell the youths about their own relatives abroad. Only a few reproached FreeMoldova members that they shouldn’t have left in the first place.

The Moldovan diaspora has drastically expanded following the 1998 economic crisis. Initially, people left illegally, with false papers, passing borders under trucks or in refrigerators, risking their lives. But in the past 20 years, people have managed to receive the right to stay in countries where they found work. Romania’s 2010 simplification of the citizenship process, and Moldova’s 2014 EU visa liberalisation regime has helped Moldovans migrate legally.

Throughout the years, the diaspora’s remittances sent back home have constituted an astonishing 20% of the former Soviet republic’s GDP. What are they looking for? A better standard of life, and a society in which one’s political allegiance or success in business isn’t threatened by the rule of a mafia-style government.",Why is the Moldovan government discriminating against the diaspora?,Opendemocracy.net,https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/paula-erizanu/why-is-moldovan-government-discriminating-against-diaspora

President Emmerson Mnangagwa (file photo).

After earning the uncanny title of ""Mr Groundbreaking"" for his vast portfolio of much-publicised investment ""mega deals"" which are taking rather too long to be implemented, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has earned a reputation as a leader who talks more than he delivers.

Critics now say Mnangagwa and his predecessor, Robert Mugabe, have something in common: a knack for creating a publicity blitz around investment deals which hardly ever take off.

With a campaign centred on economic reform and his ""Zimbabwe is open for business"" mantra, Mnangagwa has very little to show on the ground to match the rhetoric.

Ahead of the July 30 general elections, Mnangagwa promised to transform Zimbabwe into a friendly investment destination, a clean break from Mugabe's hollow anti-Western and pro-Chinese policies.

Since assuming power through a military coup in November 2017, Mnangagwa's administration has boasted that Zimbabwe attracted a staggering US$12 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI), mostly through various ""mega-deals"" signed during the course of last year.

But reality on the ground paints a far bleaker and contrarian picture.

According to the 2019 budget, Zimbabwe has over the past six years attracted FDI averaging below US$1 billion annually, while Mozambique's investment inflows peaked at over US$6 billion in 2013, before declining to US$2,3 billion in 2017.

Despite the much-touted billions of dollars in investment, numbers prove that Zimbabwe is still an unattractive investment destination, having raked in a paltry US$470 million in FDI in 2018.

Last year, Mnangagwa announced that his government had managed to secure US$5,2 billion from China Power and General Electric to build a 2 800-megawatt (MW) hydro-power generation station at Batoka Gorge in the Zambezi Valley. The project is yet to take off amid speculation that Chinese investors have developed cold feet over concerns that they would find it difficult to recoup their investment.

Mnangagwa last year called a press conference announcing that Australian-listed Invictus Energy would initially invest US$20 million to explore for oil reserves around the Muzarabani area. The figure was expected to increase to hundreds of millions of dollars depending on the availability of the resource, he said.

Invictus managing director Scott Macmillan told the Zimbabwe Independent this week his company would drill its first well in mid-2020. He said re-interpretation of seismic data would take longer than expected.

His comments suggest the project could be off-track as processing of large volumes of seismic data is likely to delay the entire project.

Invictus is utilising data gathered by energy company Mobil in the 1990s.This suggests the company has not invested a cent in new exploration.

""We are reprocessing the seismic data at the moment. We had the original field tapes stored at the Geo Survey in Harare transcribed to digital format. I guess the simplest way to explain it is that it is like remastering old records or films from their original recordings. The reprocessing will take a couple of months,"" Macmillan said.

Questions are swirling over the project, with Macmillan expressing concern over the unavailability of a drilling rig in Zimbabwe, a development he said could inflate the cost of the project.

""There are some rigs in Mozambique that have been drilling for Sasol, otherwise we will have to mobilise something from North Africa or Middle East. The initial exploration well will cost between US$10 million and US$20 million, depending on how much the mobilisation of the rig costs us,"" Macmillan said.

Last April, Mnangagwa parcelled out vast platinum claims to Lucas Pourolis through his Karo Resources investment vehicle to set up a refinery plant estimated at US$4,2 billion with potential to create over 100 000 jobs.

However, Bobby Morse, a senior partner at Tharisa Plc -- a sister company of Karo Resources -- disowned the US$4,2 billion figure in an interview with the Independent, suggesting the investment amount was plucked from thin air by government. The deal is yet to take off despite the euphoria around its groundbreaking ceremony was held.

Mnangagwa's administration in June last year also announced another controversial US$5,2 billion project with a murky South African outfit Nkosikhona Holdings to transform coal into fuel in the Zambezi Basin.

The deal involves at least five companies from Zimbabwe, China, South Africa and Canada is expected to solve the country's perennial fuel crisis.

Zimbabweans will have to wait a little longer for tangible results on the ground.

Higher and Tertiary Education minister Amon Murwira, whose ministry is responsible for the project billed to produce eight million litres of fuel daily told the Independent that the project would take longer to implement due to its complexity.

""We are now doing financials. Verify (Engineering, a technology company formed by the ministry) now has a board, so things are moving. These are huge scientific complex issues so people cannot expect things to be done in six months,"" Murwira said.

""It's a process, which will take five years, this is a scientific project, and right now I can say procurement has started. If you want operational issues and technical details you get them from Verify Engineering. It is now off the desk of cabinet and it is now off my desk. They should now start drafting the plant.""

Murwira insists government had conducted due diligence on the project.

""But you must note that we do due diligence, and the country is not losing any money in this deal, Magcor is bring in all the money needed for the project and we have the coal concessions, this is a heritage-based project,"" Murwira said.

The murky deal involves Nkosikhona Holdings, a South African company registered in 2013 which has a questionable track record. Nkosikhona signed the deal with government through Verify Engineering Private in May.

Magcor -- an engineering and international development consortium of companies registered in Canada with a presence in the United States, Philippines, China and Africa -- has, however, effectively seized control of the project in a capital-for-equity deal with Nkosikhona.

The deal resulted in the creation of a new entity, Vectol Zimbabwe, which will implement the project. Magcor is the major shareholder in Vectol, while Nkosikhona and Verify will have insignificant roles.

A search at the Company Registry shows Vectol, was still in its infancy, and was yet to be formally registered. And in October Vectol roped in Chinese contractors, signing memoranda of agreements who are supposed to implement the project.

Last year, government also signed an agricultural deal with the Financial and Commodities Ecosystem (FinComEco) to the tune of US$1,5 billion, touted to directly create 630 000 jobs.",Zimbabwe: Govt's Mega Projects Stall,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902220364.html

Five candidates are running, each with a specific program. Former president Abdoulaye Wade called for protests against the polls after his son was banned from running.

Senegal's presidential candidates had three weeks to convince voters that they have got what it takes to be elected head of the country. Five candidates are in the race for the office of president in one of Africa's most stable democracies. Incumbent president Macky Sall is seeking his final five-year mandate after coming to power with a seven-year mandate in 2012. A 2016 referendum slashed the seven-year presidential term to five and reaffirmed the two-term limit.

Sall is up against two strong and experienced aspirants: former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck and former Foreign Affairs Minister Madicke Niang. Seck is making his third bid for the top job. The 59-year-old promised to build a modern hospital and a local university in each of the country's 45 departments, as well as a health center in each commune. 65-year-old Madicke Niang wants to reform the justice system.

Specific electoral programs

El Hadji Issa Sall, an academic and lawmaker, and Ousmane Sonko, who is the youngest contestant, are the outsiders in the race. 63-year-old Sall has promised to clean up dangerous suburbs and revamp fish processing plants down the coast. 44-year-old Sonko is a rising opposition figure -- he pledged to renegotiate all gas and mining contracts that have already been signed by the current regime. Another two major aspirants, Karim Wade and Khalifa Sall, were barred by the top court over corruption.

Dr Gilles Yabi, director of WATHI, a pan African think tank, welcomed the candidates' efforts to propose specific electoral programs - something he says is not usually associated with elections in African countries. ""I think this is something that merits praise,"" he said. ""There are many elements regarding the justice system in all the programs, such as the construction of a new prison and the setting up of reintegration program for detainees on their release."" There would also be incentives and obligations for companies to recruit handicapped people with a specific salary, with penalties to be paid if this is not respected, Yabi added. ""There is definitely an effort to present original programs.""

Ex-President Wade calls for protests

But the campaign has not been all smooth sailing. Violence broke out in Tambadounda in the south-east of the country, leaving at least two people dead and 24 arrested. Many others were injured following violent clashes between supporters of incumbent Macky Sall and those of El Hadj Issa Sall. As a result, El-Hadji Issa Sall and Ousmane Sonko's parties decided to take a break and stop their campaign caravans.

It is the first time so few candidates are running in a presidential election since 1988. Tensions are running high in the country dubbed the most stable in West Africa. Ex-president Abdoulaye Wade called on voters to burn down polling stations and their voting cards in protest that his own son is barred from running. His party, the main opposition Democratic Party of Senegal (PDS), is not fielding a candidate. Abdoulaye Wade had called for a boycott of the vote citing threats to security but the government dismissed his call.

Content over personality

Interior Minister Aly Ngouille Ndiaye had given an assurance that the elections would be carried out transparently and said rigging was impossible. However, many Dakar residents are not convinced. Complaints about delays in the issuing of voter ID cards became loud, residents claimed that some people had been waiting for years and still had not received their voting cards. Social media users had also pushed for a first-ever televised pre-election debate with all five candidates, but the National Audiovisual Regulatory Council announced that it would not authorize national television and radio channels to broadcast such a program in the context of the current election campaign.

100 observers from the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland and Canada will accompany the election. International communications consultant Amy Sarr Fall thinks that once at the voting booth, people will choose content over personality. ""Citizens will ask themselves: Who will help me best to face what awaits me after the election? Who will help me keep my business efficient, who will help me keep my head above water in a difficult economy - and who will help me keep my job?""",Five Presidential Candidates for Senegal,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902220783.html

The Security Council returned today to the political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela for the second time in as many months, with speakers debating whether to press for free and fair elections under international supervision or to encourage the Government of President Nicolás Maduro to open dialogue with the opposition, free of external interference.

Nearly 40 Member States participated in today’s meeting, including Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela’s Minister of the People’s Power for Foreign Affairs, who accused the United States of using humanitarian assistance as a cover for aggression. He also called upon the Council to adopt a resolution rejecting the use of force, or the threat of such use, against his country.

Briefing members at the outset of the meeting, Rosemary DiCarlo, Under‑Secretary‑General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, described “an alarming escalation of tensions” since she last briefed the Council on 26 January (see Press Release SC/13680). Citing last weekend’s violence on Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil, and the scale of the unfolding humanitarian crisis, she reiterated the Secretary-General’s appeal for calm and restraint.

“Much more remains to be done to address the extremely urgent needs of the Venezuelan people,” she said, emphasizing that the United Nations stands ready to expand its efforts, in accordance with humanitarian principles and working with Venezuelan institutions to help those in need. The Secretary-General is prepared to exercise his good offices if the parties so wish. “Venezuelan actors across the political spectrum have the responsibility to put the interests of the Venezuelan people at the centre of their actions at this most critical time,” she stressed.

In the ensuing debate, Elliott Abrams, Special Representative for Venezuela of the United States — whose delegation requested the meeting — said President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela is dancing as people are dying. While claiming that the delivery of aid is a cover for political intervention, his regime is using violence, including by armed gangs, against the Venezuelan people, he added. The United States and many other countries support democracy and call for humanitarian assistance for Venezuelans, he noted, emphasizing that free, fair elections and Mr. Guaidó’s safe and swift return are the answer to the tyranny. “The people of Venezuela need our solidarity and help,” he said. “Let us resolve to give them that help.”

By contrast, the Russian Federation’s representative said the Council should not be focusing on the situation “in” Venezuela, but rather the situation “around” it. What occurred on the Colombian border on 23 February was not an attempt to deliver aid, but to breach the frontier of an independent State, he said, stressing: “If the United States wanted to deliver aid, it would do so through an international aid agency.” Proposing a way forward, he said Venezuela’s people must resolve their own problems through solutions based on respect for national sovereignty. He recalled that, following a recent Security Council statement expressing concern about demonstrations in Haiti, Council members pledged to work with that country’s Government to address pressing issues. Perhaps the United States and other Council members would support a similar text for Venezuela, he suggested.

Foreign Minister Arreaza of Venezuela said it is fitting for the Council to address the international aggression faced by his country’s people. Without a doubt, such aggression threatens regional and international peace and stability, he added, noting also that it also violates the Charter of the United Nations. He went on to criticize Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo’s briefing as biased, insisting that his country’s security forces used no deadly force during last weekend’s border incidents. “The coup failed”, and now is the time to return to sanity and to respect international law and Venezuela’s Constitution, he asserted. The Government is now waiting to sit down with the opposition to decide Venezuela’s future without interference from anyone, most of all the United States, he said, expressing hope that the White House will give Mr. Guaidó its approval to begin talks.

Peru’s delegate cited the Lima Group Declaration, saying it reflects the Latin America and Caribbean region’s awareness of the crisis. Noting that the situation, exacerbated by massive migration, is affecting the region’s stability, he emphasized that Venezuelans themselves must carry out a transition to democracy without using force. Peru calls for the holding of free and fair elections under international monitoring mechanisms, he added.

Cuba’s representative said the United States is fabricating pretexts for military aggression against Venezuela. Emphasizing the importance of acknowledging the country’s national elections of May 2018, he said the Governments trying to deliver humanitarian aid are the same ones exerting pressure for regime change. Reaffirming Cuba’s support for President Maduro, she stressed that peace and security in Latin America must be defended and upheld.

Colombia’s representative, citing this week’s meeting of the Lima Group as a good example of multilateral action, emphasized the impact of Venezuela’s situation on his own country. There is urgent need to provide humanitarian assistance to the country’s people, he said, adding that the dictatorship there has ceased to think about its own population.

Bolivia’s delegate urged the Council to pay close attention to the assertion by the United States that “all options are on the table”. Such a policy has proven tragic for many countries in the region, he said, recalling the invasions of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama and Haiti. It also awakens memories of the Iran-Contra affair, the Monroe Doctrine and the decision by the United States to post photos of Muammar al-Qadhafi’s assassination on Twitter, he added.

Nicaragua’s representative said he was appalled by the threats issued by some members, emphasizing that aggression and hostility must end. People must be able to choose their own future, he added, stressing: “We have opted for peace and not war.” Nicaragua welcomes international efforts to defend and uphold international law. Underlining his country’s support for President Maduro, he declared: “We must know how to choose a life with respect and uphold the nobility of our soul.”

Mexico’s representative said any humanitarian concern must be addressed through neutral international organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or agencies of the United Nations.

Also speaking today were representatives of France, Dominican Republic, Belgium, Poland, South Africa, Kuwait, Germany, Indonesia, Côte d’Ivoire, China, United Kingdom, Equatorial Guinea, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, Suriname (on behalf of several members of the Caribbean Community), Paraguay, Uruguay, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Canada, Belize, Ecuador, Antigua and Barbuda, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica and Dominica.

The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 7:58 p.m.

Briefing

ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noted “an alarming escalation of tensions” in Venezuela since her last briefing to the Council a month ago. The United States and other countries stockpiled food and medical supplies on that country’s borders with Colombia and Brazil, while the Russian Federation and China delivered supplies to Venezuela in coordination with the latter’s Government, she said. Violence broke out when Venezuelan security forces blocked efforts led by Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, to bring food and medicine into the country and two trucks attempting to cross the border were set on fire, she added. Colombian immigration authorities said at least 285 people were injured on their side of the frontier, whereas Brazilian indigenous groups supporting the Venezuelan opposition on the border met resistance when attempting to deliver aid. Between 22 and 23 February, four deaths were confirmed near the Brazilian border and 64 people were injured, most of them by gunshots, she said, citing the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which also received reports pointing to the involvement of pro-Government armed elements in violent attacks against protesters.

She went on to recall the Secretary-General’s statement of 23 February, in which he expressed shock and sadness at the violence and loss of life while reiterating his appeal that lethal force not be used under any circumstances. For its part, OHCHR condemned the violent scenes on the two borders, as well as the excessive use of force by Venezuela’s security forces, she said, urging the Government to rein in proxy groups and arrest those using force against protesters. Emphasizing the Secretary-General’s concern at the humanitarian situation, she said it is difficult to assess the situation in the absence of official data. However, available information depicts a grim reality, with the economy deteriorating, many people dying of preventable causes and others leaving the country. Citing civil society groups, she said maternal mortality rates have increased by more than 50 per cent since 2017. Approximately 80 per cent of hospitals lack required medicine and 30 to 40 per cent of medical personnel have left Venezuela, in addition to an estimated 3.4 million other people, she said.

The United Nations system is working with relevant State institutions and other entities to address those challenges, she continued. Since 2018, the Organization has been implementing a scaled-up effort focused on saving lives, economic recovery, preventing conflict and protecting human rights. Emphasizing that delivery of assistance is guided by General Assembly resolution 46/182 as well as the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, she said it must be free of political objectives and delivered on the basis of need. “Much more remains to be done to address the extremely urgent needs of the Venezuelan people,” she said, adding that the United Nations stands ready to expand its efforts, in accordance with humanitarian principles and working with Venezuelan institutions to help those in need. The Secretary-General is ready to exercise his good offices if the parties wish him to do so, she stated, adding: “Venezuelan actors across the political spectrum have the responsibility to put the interests of the Venezuelan people at the centre of their actions at this most critical time.”

Statements

ELLIOT ABRAMS, Special Representative for Venezuela of the United States , said that today’s meeting is the result of President Maduro’s decision to prevent humanitarian assistance from entering Venezuela, which led to four people dying and more than 80 others being injured. Indeed, Maduro is dancing while people are suffering and dying, he said, adding that, while claiming that aid delivery is a cover for political intervention, his regime is using violence, including by armed gangs, and betraying the Venezuelan people. As he continues to politicize aid, any further time he spends in power will be to oppress the people at a time when televised reports show children picking through garbage, he said, describing the situation as a grim reflection of the sad plight of millions of Venezuelans. The United States, alongside many other countries, supports democracy and calls for humanitarian assistance for the Venezuelan people, he said, emphasizing that free, fair elections and Mr. Guaidó’s safe and swift return are the answer to the tyranny. Calling upon the Security Council to play its role in meeting the growing needs of Venezuelans, he also asked all Member States to help them address the current humanitarian situation. “The people of Venezuela need our solidarity and help,” he stressed. “Let us resolve to give them that help.”

GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA ( Peru ) recalled the Lima Group’s recent declaration reflecting regional awareness of the crisis in Venezuela, noting that the current situation, exacerbated by massive migration, is affecting stability in the region. Peru, host to 700,000 Venezuelan migrants, remains committed to demonstrating its solidarity with them, he said, pointing out that more than 80 per cent of those remaining in Venezuela are experiencing food insecurity and lack of basic services while facing arbitrary detention and indiscriminate violence by armed groups in the Maduro regime’s service. The transition to democracy must be carried out by Venezuelans themselves, without the use of force, he emphasized, calling for free and fair elections to be held under international monitoring mechanisms. The current regime’s lack of commitment to a peaceful solution is clear, he said, calling for an end to the oppression of Venezuelans. Meanwhile, it is necessary to maintain ties with the Maduro regime with a view to holding elections and finding a peaceful solution to the crisis, he emphasized.

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE ( France ) noted that after the Maduro regime’s forces killed and injured unarmed citizens at the border, hundreds of Venezuelan soldiers chose to defect rather than attack their own people. The political and humanitarian crisis is no accident, but a result of the regime’s multiple violations of international law, he said, emphasizing that, as a result, President Maduro has no legitimacy and Mr. Guaidó should organize new presidential elections. He called upon the regime to demonstrate humanity and facilitate access for United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations with the aim of relieving the people’s suffering. “Each minute that we lose costs lives,” he said, stressing: “Venezuela is currently on the edge of an abyss.” He added: “Our responsibility is to give Venezuelans a voice and help them restore democracy.”

JOSÉ SINGER WEISINGER ( Dominican Republic ) said holding free and fair elections in a climate of respect for human rights and international support is the only way forward, emphasizing the need to foster trust in order to arrive at that goal. Noting that other countries in the region are hosting millions of Venezuelans fleeing the instability, he cautioned that accommodating such large numbers could, in fact, destabilize the host countries. He went on to cite reports of foreign planes using bases in the region, noting that the Cuban and Venezuelan authorities said aircraft are landing in Santo Domingo. Reiterating his delegation’s position that military interventions will not resolve the crisis, he described such reports as false and expressed hope that those leading this “disinformation campaign” will issue corrections. Expressing regret over the recent border clashes and the spiralling negative rhetoric, he expressed Peru’s wish that Venezuelans will take an active part in shaping their own future.

MAC PECSTEEN DE BUYTSWERVE ( Belgium ) said the situation constitutes a threat to the region, and to prevent it from worsening, all actors must work towards a peaceful solution while avoiding violence at all costs. He called upon the parties to exercise restraint, provide humanitarian access and organize elections, while encouraging all actors to do everything possible to reduce tensions, including by ensuring press freedoms. He also called upon all actors to facilitate aid deliveries, stressing that it is unacceptable for irregular armed groups to intimidate civilians mobilizing to distribute assistance. He urged swift action to organize elections, pointing out the political origins of the current crisis while emphasizing that the solution must also political, with Venezuelans deciding their own future.

JOANNA WRONECKA ( Poland ) condemned the indiscriminate and excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces and pro-Maduro armed groups against unarmed protesters. Warning that violence can spiral out of control and further complicate the multidimensional conflict, she emphasized: “Because of the political origin of this conflict, we strongly believe that the solution to it can only be political as well.” Reiterating Poland’s recognition of National Assembly President Guadió as the only legitimate power in Venezuela, she said the oppressive Maduro regime created the unprecedented migration and humanitarian crises that have had such tremendous consequences on neighbouring Latin American countries. “No matter how eloquently and passionately representatives of Maduro will deny it, the humanitarian catastrophe in Venezuela is real and its citizens are in dire need of urgent humanitarian aid,” she stressed.

JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA ( South Africa ) said the Council is divided on the internal affairs of a fellow Member State, with some even threatening to use force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Venezuela. This is inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations. Africa has suffered a great deal as external forces used undemocratic tools of regime change to solve problems on the continent. “Let the people of Venezuela decide their future,” he said. South Africa draws from its experience in using dialogue to overcome a repressive and insidious racist regime, and believes that internal, inclusive discussion remains the only viable and sustainable path to ending the political crisis in Venezuela. The Council should base its efforts on Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, where parties are encouraged to first seek a solution through a peaceful means of their choice.

MANSOUR AYYAD SH. A. ALOTAIBI ( Kuwait ) said those responsible for deplorable acts must be held to account, emphasizing that stakeholders must uphold international law and human rights while respecting the will of Venezuela’s people. Expressing concern about the humanitarian situation, he congratulated those countries hosting Venezuelans who have fled their country, urging all stakeholders to help those in need without discrimination or politicization. Calling for restraint and the prevention of further bloodshed, he urged the Secretary-General to use his good offices to bring about a political solution so as to avert instability in the region.

CHRISTOPH HEUSGEN ( Germany ) said that political factors led to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and therefore the solution can only be a political one, rejecting the use of force or any measures that could put the stability of the country and the region at risk. Calling for the restoration of the democratic process and constitutional order of Venezuela through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, he said it is high time to let the country’s people freely choose their leaders and the future path of their nation. Warning against the politicization of the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans in need, he said a response to humanitarian needs does not constitute an interference with the country’s internal affairs. With 3.4 million people seeking shelter in neighboring countries, the situation affects the region. Human rights are not an internal affair, but a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”.

MUHSIN SYIHAB ( Indonesia ) said that his country supports the Montevideo Mechanism, which seeks to preserve peace in Venezuela based on the principle of non-interference and peaceful resolution of conflicts. He urged the delivery of all humanitarian aid for the people of Venezuela through a proper channel by the United Nations in close coordination with the Government. Too often, the Council has failed in its mandate because of narrowly motivated interests that have been allowed to prevail over those of the most vulnerable. The failure of this organ has severely impaired its credibility in the eyes of the international community. His delegation hopes that Venezuela will be able to peacefully overcome this crisis.

GBOLIÉ DÉSIRÉ WULFRAN IPO ( C ôte d’Ivoire ), noting with regret the unfortunate events on the Colombian and Brazilian borders, emphasized that humanitarian assistance, regardless of the source, must reach those who need it. Calling upon all sides to demonstrate restraint and seek a political solution through dialogue, he said what is happening in Venezuela is essentially a political and institutional issue, stressing that it there can be no military solution. He urged negotiations with a view to generating consensus-based solutions to the root causes of the crisis, underlining the need for regional actors to support all peaceful initiatives likely to ease tensions.

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) emphasized that the meeting’s focus should not be the situation “in” Venezuela, but the situation “around” Venezuela, since the United States has taken steps into the region, incited opposition leaders to withdraw from the previous Venezuelan elections and recognized, within minutes, the naming of Juan Guaidó as interim President. These and other similar acts trample the law and constitutional rights, he said, adding that it is clear to all that no judge or court of law will sign on to this “mockery”. Meanwhile, the United States imposed sanctions that have caused grave economic losses for Venezuela and is now conducting an operation to transfer unknown materials into that country while using civilians as human shields, he said. Video images of the events of 23 February show people moving from Colombian territory in an aggressive manner, he noted, describing the scenario as anything but the delivery of humanitarian aid. Instead, it was an attempted breach of an independent State’s borders, he said, stressing that, in fact, one country wishes to build a barrier to keep people from crossing its border. “Let us call a spade a spade,” he said, adding: “This is not humanitarian aid.” He stressed: “If the United States wanted to deliver aid, it would do so through an international aid agency.”

He went on to state that the Venezuelan authorities are willing to arrange proper aid deliveries, adding that the actions of the United States and its allies can be defined as “force feeding”, which is actually a defined form of torture. In effect, the United States is trying to force-feed an entire country, he said, demanding an end to violations of relevant United Nations resolutions and the unfreezing of accounts, including those belonging to the Venezuelan people. Those supporting the United States are complicit in violating the United Nations Charter, he emphasized, calling upon all States in the region to firmly voice support for the Charter. A solution to Venezuela’s problems is for the Venezuelan people themselves, he said, stressing that solutions to the tumult in the country should unfold in a manner that respects its national sovereignty. Instead of discussing national dialogue, Mr. Guaidó wants to keep the military ready, he pointed out, adding that Washington’s approach is one of intervention. Following the recent Security Council decision expressing concern about demonstrations in Haiti, members pledged to work with that country’s Government to address pressing issues, he recalled, asking whether his counterpart with the delegation of the United States and other Council members would support a similar text for Venezuela.

MA ZHAOXU ( China ) called upon the parties to seek a political settlement through dialogue and consultations. All countries must abide by the basic principles of international law and international relations, which oppose foreign interference, military intervention and the use of humanitarian assistance to destabilize situations for political reasons, he emphasized. Instead, solutions should be centred on actions to benefit Venezuelans by addressing relevant issues and finding negotiated ways to move forward.

STEPHEN HICKEY ( United Kingdom ), in response to the Russian Federation’s representative, said most Council members would not have used live fire to attack civilians, nor arrested and detained political opponents. Condemning the violence on Venezuela’s borders, he emphasized that only a democratic solution will resolve the crisis, noting also the importance of countries in the region playing their role. Only through free and fair elections can there be an end to the current humanitarian crisis, he stressed. He called upon the Council to send a clear message that Venezuela must hold elections.

ANATOLIO NDONG MBA ( Equatorial Guinea ), Council President for February, spoke in his national capacity, saying that today’s meeting offers an opportunity to reflect on finding a political solution negotiated among Venezuelans with mediation by a neutral party, such as the United Nations. Emphasizing that almost the entire international community opposes a military solution, he said that in as much as the issue at hand is a national one, politicians in Venezuela must sit down and discuss a way forward. It is incumbent upon the constitutional Government to pave the way towards inclusive dialogue and the restoration of peace, and since dialogue with national actors is the sole option for resolving the crisis, the Secretary-General should get involved in facilitating such discussions. The fact that the Council has twice debated the issue in the last month demonstrates the need for the United Nations to indeed play a role, he stressed.

Mr. ABRAMS ( United States ), taking the floor a second time in response to his Russian Federation counterpart, expressed surprise to hear cold war rhetoric when efforts are under way in Hanoi to resolve some problems from that era. The attempt by the United States to provide assistance was carried out at the request of Venezuela’s legitimate interim Government, he said, asking how much aid from the Russian Federation reached those in need. That country is “no doubt” worried about recovering its loans from Venezuela, but that will only happen if the economy can grow again, he said. He also rejected, “from start to finish”, accusations of military intervention by a country occupying parts of Georgia and Ukraine.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) also took the floor a second time, noting that for some reason, the representative of the United States is under the impression that Moscow is only concerned about its money. Did it not occur to him that the Russian Federation perhaps has other interests? Emphasizing that his country does not tolerate egregious and arrogant trampling of international law and interference in other countries, he went on to ask whether the United States is ready to support a Council press statement, as proposed by the Russian Federation, in which the word “Venezuela” replaces “Haiti”.

JORGE ARREAZA, Minister of the People’s Power for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela , expressed appreciation for the opportunity to speak the truth about the situation in the face of colonial arrogance thought to have disappeared from the Council. The Venezuelan people remain subject to international aggression and it is fitting for the Council to discuss that, he said, emphasizing that, without a doubt, it is a threat to regional and international peace and security as well as a violation of the United Nations Charter. The Under-Secretary-General’s briefing was biased and sought to disseminate information from a single source, he added, noting that it was not in line with what was discussed earlier with the Secretary-General.

Recalling that the United States has been leading aggression against Venezuela for many years, he said last weekend’s border incidents constituted a well-organized attempt to violate his country’s sacred sovereignty. However, the security forces contained the incidents with tear gas and other methods, but no deadly force, he said, adding that people armed with Molotov cocktails set fire to humanitarian trucks later found to be carrying not just food and medicine, but also barricades, nails, chicken wire and other materials for use by the Venezuelan opposition. The President of the United States, its Vice-President, its Secretary of State and others constitute a “chain of command” for intervention in Venezuela, he said, adding that he has lost count of the number of Twitter messages containing gangster-like language aimed at the Venezuelan people and their revolutionary forces. “The coup failed” and now is the time to return to sanity and to respect international law and Venezuela’s constitution, he stressed.

The Government is now waiting to sit down with the opposition to decide Venezuela’s future without interference from anyone, most of all the United States, he continued, expressing hope that the White House will give Mr. Guaidó and the opposition approval to enter into dialogue. Stressing that the Council does not exist to wage war or to create the conditions for others to wage war, he called for saving Venezuela “because the threat of the scourge of war is here today”. Echoing the proposal by the Russian Federation’s representative, he said the Council must adopt a resolution that rejects the use of force, or the threat to use force, against his country. Venezuelans are today going to school and to the beach, with Carnival just around the corner, he said. While conceding the effects of inflation, he stressed that there is light at the end of the tunnel and the economy is improving. Condemning “lies and propaganda”, he said foreign policy is being used to win votes in Florida for President Trump and to secure Venezuelan oil for companies of the United States.

SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ ( Bolivia ), emphasizing that Latin America and the Caribbean were a region of peace committed to resolving differences peacefully, described the recent attempt to deliver humanitarian aid as a Trojan horse intended to achieve its political objective — regime change in Venezuela. Despite that country’s massive social media campaign describing the operation as an attempt to provide “humanitarian assistance”, neither the Red Cross nor the United Nations allowed themselves to be used in such a way, he noted. The Security Council must pay close attention to the declaration by the United States that “all options are on the table”, he said, expressing regret at the tragic consequences that policy has had for many countries of the region, including the invasions of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama and Haiti. “All options on the table” also brings back memories of the Iran-contra affair, the Monroe Doctrine and the decision by the United States to post on Twitter photos of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi’s assassination and the devastation wrought upon his country, he said, wondering also why humanitarian aid was not discussed at that time and whether peace, democracy and freedom now exist in Libya. Emphasizing the Security Council’s grave responsibility to avoid the repetition of that situation in Latin America — since the invasion of Venezuela is really about oil, as in the cases of Iraq and Libya — he welcomed the declarations of the Montevideo Mechanism and the Lima Group, stressing that humanitarian assistance must be depoliticized and a constructive national dialogue in Venezuela supported.

JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ ( Mexico ) called upon all actors to exercise restraint, avoid excessive use of force and respect the human rights of the Venezuelan people. While the delivery of humanitarian aid is critical, any humanitarian concern must be addressed through neutral international organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or United Nations agencies, he said. Negotiating a solution is the way forward, as per the Montevideo Mechanism signed by 16 countries in the region, he said, noting that it supports inclusive dialogue to resolve differences. Similar effective diplomatic mechanisms should be established to affect a peaceful solution in Venezuela, he stressed.

ANA SILVIA RODRÍGUEZ ABASCAL ( Cuba ), referring to recent incidents, said the United States continues to fabricate pretences for military aggression against Venezuela. This invasion must be denounced. Countries of the region have just stated that a military intervention is not a solution to the crisis. However, the United States continues to keep “all options on the table”. It is important to acknowledge the elections held in Venezuela in May 2018. Governments that are attempting to deliver humanitarian aid are the same ones that are exerting pressure on Venezuela for regime change. Cuba reaffirms its constant support for Mr. Maduro, the legitimate constitutional president. Peace and security in Latin America must be defended and upheld. Given that the situation is urgent, all parties must do their utmost to engage in dialogue. The legitimacy of a Government remains with the people, not external actors. She urged the United Nations and particularly the Security Council to oppose military intervention in Venezuela. The Council must defend peace, she stressed.

MILENKO E. SKOKNIC TAPIA ( Chile ) said that over the past few days, the world has witnessed a crisis in Venezuela. Humanitarian assistance must reach people in need. Chile condemned the violence perpetrated by Government armed forces against unarmed civilians who were “only trying to access humanitarian assistance”. Venezuela’s people are facing an unjustified political and economic crisis. Chile expresses its condolences to the families of those civilians who have died and urges the need to hold elections. Chile, as part of the Lima Group, backs a political, diplomatic and peaceful settlement to the crisis. Chile is not prepared to support actions contrary to international law. Dialogue is the only way to ensure a solution to this protracted conflict.

GUILLERMO FERNANDEZ DE SOTO VALDERRAMA ( Colombia ) stressed his country’s essential belief in multilateralism, praising the meeting of the Lima Group as a good example of the relevance of multilateral action. The Group endorsed the interim President, given the need to restore freedom in Venezuela and massive human rights violations there. The situation is transcending national borders and affecting Colombia. Due to the lack of food and medicine, 3.4 million people left Venezuela and 3.7 million of the country’s people remain malnourished. There is an urgent need to provide them with humanitarian assistance. The dictatorship there ceased to think about its own people. Colombia can provide details of what happened lately regarding attacks on humanitarian convoys consisting of four trucks. Tear gas was used by Venezuela’s armed forces. The trucks were ordered to return and the bridge was closed. The Lima Group concurred on the need to deliver humanitarian assistance, achieve a democratic transition and reconstruct the country’s institutions and economy.

MARTÍN GARCÍA MORITÁN ( Argentina ) said the crisis in Venezuela requires urgent international action, stressing the important role of the Council in preventing the situation from deteriorating further. The dictatorship prevented humanitarian assistance. His delegation condemns repressive actions and violence against civilians. These could constitute a crime against humanity. The Lima Group concluded unanimously that Mr. Maduro staying in power constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region. The United Nations cannot remain idle. He called attention to a resolution — sponsored by Argentina and other nations and adopted in the Human Rights Council — urging Venezuela to accept humanitarian aid and promote human rights. He appealed for the restoration of rule of law and protection of human rights in Venezuela.

FREDERICO SALOMÃO DUQUE ESTRADA MEYER ( Brazil ) said the events of 23 February were a “wake-up call” and that the regime’s actions to block humanitarian aid are brutally cruel. “We are all keenly aware that the brutal and illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro has taken a regrettable detour from any vision of a free and prosperous future for its people,” he added. It was only fitting that the President of the democratically-elected National Assembly, the only legitimate power standing in Venezuela, swore himself in as interim President of the country. He condemned the regime’s criminal use of violence and military force against the provision of humanitarian assistance and reiterated the appeal to the Armed Forces of Venezuela to adhere to the legitimate authority of President Guaidó. The Lima Group conveyed to the International Criminal Court its support to a request submitted in September 2018 that it examine the humanitarian catastrophe committed by the Maduro regime. Brazil called on the international community to join efforts for the democratic transition in Venezuela, demanding that the regime’s violence against its own people be stopped.

JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO ( Nicaragua ) said he was appalled by the threats by some States that seek to separate people. All must respect the will of the people and do away with actions that lead to suffering, he said, emphasizing that aggression and hostility must end. Practices that destroy economies and expose people to misery must be denounced and condemned, he said, pointing out that they subject millions of human beings to poverty. People must be able to choose their own future, he said, stressing: “We have opted for peace and not war.” Nicaragua welcomes international efforts to defend and uphold international law. “We must know how to choose a life with respect and uphold the nobility of our soul,” he added, emphasizing his delegation’s support for President Maduro.

OMAR CASTAÑEDA SOLARES ( Guatemala ) said tens of thousands of Venezuela’s people are facing tenuous circumstances and humanitarian aid is badly needed. To end the current situation, a free, transparent election must take place as soon as possible, with a presence of international observers. The fact that Mr. Maduro remains in power represents a threat to the region. Calling upon the United Nations to act within the provisions of the Charter, he said the transition towards democracy must be carried out by Venezuelans themselves. Condemning any military solutions, he said Guatemala will continue to strive to achieve peace and security for all the people of Venezuela.

KITTY SWEEB ( Suriname ), speaking on behalf of some members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), said those countries “do not choose one side or the other”, but, instead, they support the principles of territorial inviolability, human rights, international law and the sanctity of national sovereignty, among others. Emphasizing that economic strangulation and military intervention are contrary to those principles, he said emphasized that such policies will only exacerbate the suffering of Venezuelans. She called for a pathway to peace forged “not by threats, but by dialogue, not by escalating the tensions, but by cooling them down”. Expressing support for the Montevideo Mechanism, she noted that four individuals internationally recognized for their competence and experience have been chosen to lead that process and urged all parties, both inside and outside Venezuela, to give it “the time and space it needs to work”.

Speaking in her national capacity , she said that reports of humanitarian aid aggressively being carried out on Venezuela’s borders while stability and tranquillity remain inside the country are particularly alarming because such actions undermine the principles of independence and impartiality. Suriname remains strongly committed to international law and therefore denounces all acts of aggression. She also rejected the politicization of humanitarian aid offered without the consent of the legitimate Government of Venezuela. She reiterated that the Montevideo Mechanism is the only way to reach a peaceful and lasting solution to the internal conflict in Venezuela, underlining that Latin America and the Caribbean must remain a zone of peace.

JULIO CÉSAR ARRIOLA RAMÍREZ ( Paraguay ) noted that 30 days have passed since the Council last met on Venezuela, asking why the 15‑member organ must meet again today. It is because the Maduro regime is causing a humanitarian crisis and poses a threat to peace and security in the region. On 23 February, criminal acts were committed by Mr. Maduro. His regime denied access to humanitarian convoys. Paraguay condemns ruthless oppression by Mr. Maduro, he said, calling on the International Criminal Court to consider looking into crimes against humanity. Paraguay was the first country to break with the regime there and lend its full support to the National Assembly elected in 2015 and the interim President. It also resolutely supports the National Recovery Plan adopted by the National Assembly. The institutional, economic and social reconstruction of Venezuela should be led by its people, who are the agents of their own liberation.

LUIS BERMUDEZ ( Uruguay ) expressed concern about the escalating tensions in Venezuela, calling on the regime to exercise caution and restraint to avoid the situation from deteriorating further. Efforts are under way to bring the parties together. The Montevideo Mechanism and the International Contact Group contribute to this peaceful process. These two formats explore possible ways to a peaceful solution. No other solution is possible. He called for fair, transparent and credible elections with reliable international oversight. Holding such elections is the best safeguard to avoid a bloodbath. Uruguay continues to be guided by full respect for international law, he said, calling for dialogue and engagement. On 25 February, at the Human Rights Council, Uruguay’s Foreign Minister stated that his country does not seek heightened tensions, urging dialogue and negotiations.

GARETH BYNOE ( Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ) said that his country, as a small, peace-loving nation with a tiny population, open borders and no standing army, owes its continued peaceful existence to the robust and universally accepted body of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. Dialogue based on mutual respect and adherence to international law is the only path to peace. The United States has demonstrated commendable restraint, patience, global leadership and belief in diplomacy over the years, including in their current pursuit of dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, he said, stressing that the same constructive approach should be exhibited with Venezuela to safeguard Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace and ensure the well-being of all Venezuelans.

MARC-ANDRÉ BLANCHARD ( Canada ) said that the Maduro regime continues to hinder access for much-needed humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in Venezuela. “Let there be no doubt: Venezuela is under the control of a dictatorship that would see its people starve rather than cede one iota of power,” he said. The Lima Group, including Canada and now with the full participation of Venezuela’s interim Government, met on 25 February in Bogota, where they affirmed that the continuance of Mr. Maduro and his illegitimate regime represent a threat to peace and security. The presidential elections in May 2018 were clearly fraudulent. “It is clear that Maduro’s regime has no authority to govern Venezuela,” he said. Calling on Member States that are in communication with the Maduro regime to urge an end to violence, he pledged that Canada will stand with the people of Venezuela in their peaceful struggle for democracy and human rights.

LOIS MICHELE YOUNG ( Belize ) urged the Security Council to dissuade any actions that would lead to military conflagration in Venezuela. While the humanitarian plight of the Venezuela’s people has gained worldwide visibility, there are concerns that such good intentions may be a mask for nefarious political intentions. Humanitarian aid, when requested and welcomed, should be channelled through the United Nations. “The situation in Venezuela is, in plain view, unwell,” she added, stressing that dialogue is the only way to a peaceful resolution. Dialogue leading to compromise and accommodation of political plurality must take place between the Government and the opposition. Above all, it must be done entirely unaccompanied by the threat or use of force.

LUIS GALLEGOS CHIRIBOGA ( Ecuador ), condemning the recent violence against peaceful civilians, said the situation in Venezuela requires an immediate political solution to the crisis. Security forces should not block the delivery of aid and efforts must be made to hold free and fair elections, he emphasized, noting that only a legitimate democracy can guarantee a stable future, economic recovery and social order, with the international community’s support. Hosting more than 240,000 Venezuelan refugees, Ecuador will hold, on 8 and 9 April, a regional conference on the mass migration of more than 3 million Venezuelans, he said, adding that the event represents an opportunity to work towards resolving the region’s largest humanitarian problem. Reiterating that there is no military solution, he emphasized that the solution rests on dialogue.

GLENTIS THOMAS ( Antigua and Barbuda ) appealed to all parties in Venezuela to remain calm and stay focused on the Montevideo Mechanism being facilitated by Mexico, Uruguay and CARICOM. Citing decades of interference into the domestic affairs of States in the region “that has left the region broken”, he warned that “we cannot and must not return to those days”. Where there is a need for humanitarian assistance, the United Nations should always facilitate aid distribution and support, free from political influence and preconditions. Stressing that Member States are bound not to interfere in the affairs of other nations, he warned that any process other than diplomacy — including military intervention — will undermine the legitimacy of the United Nations and destabilize the region. Any unilateral declaration of support for one side over the other in Venezuela amounts to a blatant interference in that country’s affairs.

RUBEN ARMANDO ESCALANTE HASBUN ( El Salvador ) expressed deep concern about the situation in Venezuela and reiterated that the responsibility to resolve the crisis lies with the Government. A solution must be found by the people of Venezuela themselves. El Salvador fully respects international law, including the Charter of the United Nations and its principles of non-use of force and non-interference. A political solution is the only viable solution to the situation in Venezuela, he said, expressing his country’s unwavering support to that end.

MARY ELIZABETH FLORES FLAKE ( Honduras ), associating herself with the Lima Declaration adopted by various countries on 25 February, expressed support for Juan Guaidó’s efforts to bring humanitarian assistance to all Venezuelans in need. Recalling that the decision by the Organization of American States (OAS) not to recognize the legitimacy of President Nicolas Maduro’s new term of office in January, she said the latter continues to usurp executive power and to undermine the rule of law. “Blocking, burning and depriving Venezuelans of humanitarian aid, food and medicine […] will be accounted for in the list of crimes against humanity” upon investigation by the International Criminal Court, she added.

ISBETH LISBETH QUIEL MURCIA ( Panama ) strongly condemned the use of force against Venezuela’s people and the blocking of aid deliveries. Noting that her country joined more than 50 others in recognizing Mr. Guaidó as interim President, she said the current illegitimate regime must allow a peaceful transition through a democratic process that leads to holding fair elections. As a member of the Lima Group, Panama supports a call for action, at the highest levels, to prevent the political, economic and humanitarian crisis from turning into a geopolitical conflict. The overarching purpose of the current international consensus is that Venezuela can recover within a peaceful, non-violent solution, she said, expressing hope that dialogue will swiftly prevail.

RODRIGO ALBERTO CARAZO ZELEDÓN ( Costa Rica ) said the welfare of Venezuela’s people must be at the centre of a solution to the crisis, with diplomacy and dialogue being fundamental tools to reaching this goal. Rejecting any course of action involving violence, force or military intervention of Venezuela, Costa Rica also rejects the excessive force used by the Maduro regime on 23 February, as well as actions that led to deprivation and the violation of rights of that country’s people. On the issue of the urgent need for humanitarian aid in Venezuela, he called on relevant United Nations agencies to act. The solution to the crisis must be peaceful, democratic and defined by Venezuela’s people, with free, fair and transparent elections in line with international standards. As the 2018 elections failed to meet inclusive standards for it to be considered legitimate, Costa Rica recognized Mr. Guaidó as interim President.

LOREEN RUTH BANNIS-ROBERTS ( Dominica ), associating herself with CARICOM, expressed strong support for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of every sovereign State. To peacefully and sustainably resolve the situation in Venezuela, there must be meaningful dialogue and diplomacy among all parties, geared towards reaffirming the rights of the people to peace and democracy. Every effort should be made to build peace, promote reconciliation and find an amicable and lasting resolution to the situation. Endorsing the Montevideo Mechanism, she said this approach will foster such a resolution.

Taking the floor for a second time, Mr. ARREAZA ( Venezuela ) reiterated that President Maduro has been working with the United Nations for several years. He personally sat down with Secretary-General António Guterres and agreed on a mechanism for accepting humanitarian assistance through the Organization. Venezuela also agreed with the European Union on this mechanism. Secondly, the war against Venezuela must stop, he said, referring to the economic blockade imposed by the United States. These sanctions undermine the economy and makes it difficult for Venezuela to seek funds from international financial institutions. The measures cost Venezuela billions of dollars. The United States has not ruled out the use of force. That country must rule out war as an option. Otherwise, it cannot be a member of the United Nations. He expressed appreciation for all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean for speaking out against the threat of use of force despite different political positions. The region is a zone of peace.

Mr. MEZA-CUADRA ( Peru ), also taking the floor for a second time, said Latin American countries have largely aligned against the use of force and a core element mentioned is the exodus of Venezuela’s people, the most serious humanitarian situation in the region. Yet, there is not a single sign of concern for the 3.4 million Venezuelans who have fled, including the 700,000 in Peru. For its part, the Lima Group proposed political and diplomatic means to re-establish democracy in Venezuela.

Mr. ARREAZA ( Venezuela ) said it is painful to consider the situation in his country, which also hosts migrants from countries in the region. The Government of Venezuela has contacted countries to confirm information on Venezuelan migrants, as the notion of 3.4 million migrants is unrealistic, he said, inviting those present from countries in the region to engage with Venezuela.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the meeting, a delegation has managed to kill the proposed draft on Venezuela, which is a blatant example of double standards.

LESLIE ORDEMAN ( United States ) said the draft in question, similar to a Council resolution on the situation in Haiti, should have included information that referred to Mr. Maduro’s actions.","Venezuelans Must Resolve Crisis Themselves, Security Council Delegates Agree while Differing over Legitimacy of Contending Parties",Un.org,https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13719.doc.htm
82,Empty,2019-02-22T18:15:38Z,"'Social media played a big part because we could point fingers at the senators, deputies, state members, and it was in their face,' he said","MONTREAL — In a photo posted to Twitter last summer, Gilbert Mirambeau Jr. sits on a couch in Montreal, wearing a blindfold and holding up a cardboard sign with a handwritten Creole message that reads: “Where is the PetroCaribe money?”

The now viral photo, posted on Aug. 14 to commemorate a 1791 slave uprising, served as a catalyst for a series of massive street protests that have been shaking the Caribbean country. Fuelled by social media, the protests have revealed the depth of anger over the rising cost of living and the alleged disappearance of billions of dollars from PetroCaribe — an oil subsidy program intended to help the impoverished Haitian people.

Mirambeau, a Haitian-Canadian filmmaker who divides his time between the two countries, said he was in Canada last summer when he became fascinated by the debate on social media over the alleged mismanagement of the PetroCaribe fund, a 2005 pact under which Venezuela provided oil to Caribbean nations with long-term, low-interest financing.

The savings on oil were supposed to be used to fund economic and social programs, but Mirambeau and many Haitians say it disappeared into the pockets of government officials, who spent it on extravagant luxuries such as mansions, casinos, and cars.

“I was witnessing this, and the whole night I couldn’t sleep,” said Mirambeau, who donned a blindfold in the picture to symbolize justice. “I had to play my part, in a sense.”

Mirambeau, 35, said his message was posted about a month after government fuel hikes in July 2018 spurred riots among a population struggling to pay for basic staples. It was retweeted by a popular rapper and actor, and other Haitians quickly joined in, using the hashtag #petrocaribechallenge.

I was witnessing this, and the whole night I couldn't sleep

Mirambeau became part of a loose coalition of leaders and activists involved in organizing a series of protests, each designed to take place on a significant date in Haiti’s history. Since last year, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest corruption and demand the resignation of the country’s president, Jovenel Moise.

“Social media played a big part because we could point fingers at the senators, deputies, state members, and it was in their face,” he said.

The most recent uprisings, which began Feb. 7, led to the Canadian government issuing a travel warning for Haiti. More than 100 Canadians had to be airlifted to the airport last week to avoid blockades along the country’s highways, where armed protesters threw rocks, fired weapons and set fire to burning tires during sometimes violent protests.

Mirambeau blamed the violence on gang members infiltrating what is a peaceful movement. “The movement is not violent,” he said. “You had a million people in the street, and they could have destroyed everything, but they were not violent.”

He said Haitians are fed up after years of alleged corruption by authorities, whom he says have largely mismanaged the PetroCaribe money and the billions of dollars designed to help the country recover from a 2010 earthquake that decimated the country’s infrastructure.

“What we feel is more than rage,” he said. “It’s social apartheid. You have the government on the side making money with our taxes and money.”

A Haitian Senate investigation has alleged embezzlement by at least 14 former officials in ex-president Michel Martelly’s administration, but no one has been charged. Late last week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant vowed to deepen the probe into spending of the estimated $3.8 billion Haiti received as part of the oil program — one of a raft of measures aimed at quelling the protests.

Jean-Claude Icart, a researcher with the Quebec-based aid partnership Concertation pour Haiti, said Mirambeau’s tweet played a role in sparking the protests, which appear to have eased since the prime minister’s speech. Icart said that for the protests to stop, the government will have to take concrete steps to improve living conditions and reduce food insecurity.

“The misery is becoming unbearable, and people who are hopeless, you don’t know what they’re going to do,” he said in a phone interview.

Pascal Paradis, the executive director of Lawyers Without Borders Canada, said he sees reason for hope in the protest movement’s demand for justice, led by young people such as Mirambeau.

“The fight against impunity needs to start with civil society,” he said.

Mirambeau, meanwhile, says the protests will continue until those responsible for the missing PetroCaribe funds are tried and convicted. He rules out running for office himself, but he hopes his generation will produce leaders to run in the next elections and eventually reform Haiti’s government, including the constitution.

“It needs to start with us,” he said. “We are the change.”

83,Empty,2019-02-25T21:35:58Z,The Trump administration’s most dangerous collision with facts has been its effort to paralyze U.S. efforts to join nations of the world in confronting climate change.,"Many have become immune or anesthetized to the daily assault on truth that is the Trump presidency, an alternative reality where North Korea has denuclearized and Russia might not have attacked our elections in 2016. It would be laughable were it not dangerous. Presidents are supposed to hold consensus together, not invent fictions to fray it. But the administration’s most dangerous collision with facts has been its effort to paralyze U.S. efforts to join nations of the world in confronting climate change. The White House plans to convene “experts” to “determine” whether climate change is a national security threat. We know what the outcome will be: President Donald Trump’s council of doubters and deniers will convene to undo a 26-year-old factual consensus that climate change is a national security threat multiplier.

Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says Donald Trump has convened a ‘kangaroo court’ to deal with climate change. ( FABRICE COFFRINI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES file photo )

As we careen toward irreversible environmental tipping points, we have no time to waste debating alternative facts only to invest years more re-establishing trust in the real ones. No panel 10 years from now can put the ice sheets back together or hold back rising tides. Begin with the kind of facts that John Adams called “stubborn things.” In 1991, President George H.W. Bush’s administration assessed in its National Security Strategy that threats such as climate change, which “respect no international boundaries,” were “already contributing to political conflict.” Each of Bush’s successors included climate change in their National Security Strategies. Even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush’s administration made room in the 2002 National Security Strategy to warn of “dangerous human interference with the global climate.” Were four consecutive administrations wrong? No. The factual basis of climate change’s threat originated not with politicians, but with the national security community, including the intelligence community. Eleven retired military leaders comprising the military advisory board at CNA, a naval think tank in Arlington, described climate change in 2007 as “a threat multiplier for instability.” Seven years later, another 16 retired flag officers representing all branches of the military implored Americans to understand the severity of “a salient national security concern” because “time and tide wait for no one.”

Instead of convening a kangaroo court, the president might want to talk with the adults he once trusted enough to fill his top national security positions. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats has reported that climate change would increase “the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jordan.” Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told the Armed Services Committee last year: “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.” Read more: Trump and Kim heap praise before summit Pence tells Canada, allies to give frozen Maduro assets to Venezuelan opposition Trump says he’ll nominate Kelly Craft as UN Ambassador

These officials weren’t making back-of-the-envelope projections or envisioning some distant, dystopian future. Climate change is already impacting national security. The land which houses Naval Station Norfolk, the biggest naval installation in the world,is literally sinking. In fact, sea levels on the East Coast are rising twice as fast as the global average, thanks to uneven ocean temperatures and geology. Consider what further sea level rise could mean for this base or for the U.S. navy fleet, 20 per cent of which is home-ported nearby. Increased risk of wildfires can even prevent troops from training with live ammunition. Wilful denial won’t change the fact that our military readiness will be degraded when the permafrost our Alaskan bases are built on begins to thaw out.

And it doesn’t end with military impacts. While climate change didn’t lead to the rise of the terrorist group Boko Haram in Nigeria, the country’s severe drought and the government’s inability to cope with it helped create the volatility that militants exploited to seize villages, butcher teachers and kidnap hundreds of innocent girls. The prospect of a more arid climate throughout the Middle East and parts of Asia will increasingly strain the most essential resource of all: fresh water. We’ve already seen tensions rise around the basins of the Nile, Central Asia’s Indus River and the Mekong in Southeast Asia. Areas facing unrest, instability and weak governance are breeding grounds for violent extremism. Climate change will only exacerbate mass migration in places already enduring economic, political and social stress. There are, of course, some people cheering the president’s apparent attempt to erase climate change from U.S. national security considerations, and they live in Beijing and Moscow. Russia and China have for years been mapping the resource competition, military implications and geostrategic challenges that climate change will present in an ever-changing, climate-impacted Arctic. What a gift to them if we stop making our own assessments because we have our heads buried in the sand while their eyes are on the tundra. We can spend the next two years debating whether two plus two equals five. But it would mean someday a young American in uniform will likely be put in harm’s way because truth lost out to talking heads. Debate how to address the climate national security threat, not whether it’s real. Mr. President, listen to our military leaders and disband your climate denial panel.

84,Empty,2019-02-25T14:20:00Z,"The UK is planning to join the US, Canada, France and the Arab League in banning all wings of Hezbollah because of its destabilising influence in the Middle East. The move would affect the Shiite group's political wing.","The United Kingdom is set to ban Shiite Islamist groups Hezbollah, Ansarul Islam and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam Muslimeen (JNIM), the UK's Home Office said in a statement on Monday.

The measure, which need parliamentary approval, is set to go into effect on Friday. If approved, being a member of — or inviting support for — the three organizations will be a criminal offense carrying a 10-year prison sentence, the Home Office said.

The UK previously distinguished the Lebanese Shia group’s military and political branches.

Hezbollah was founded in the early 1980s with the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. London proscribed Hezbollah's external security unit and its military wing in 2001 and 2008 respectively.

Hezbollah made electoral gains in Lebanon last year and now has three ministers in government.

""Hezbollah is continuing in its attempts to destabilize the fragile situation in the Middle East — and we are no longer able to distinguish between their already banned military wing and the political party,"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said as part of the statement. ""Because of this, I have taken the decision to proscribe the group in its entirety,"" he added.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Terror group? A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Renewed conflict with Israel? Iran and Hezbollah have increased their political and military strength through the war in Syria. Israel views this as a threat and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Israel has vowed to not let Iran and Hezbollah create a permanent presence in Syria. There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter



Joining a group

The UK is now one of 11 countries and entities that have classified Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization — a list which includes The Arab League, Canada, France, Israel and the United States. Three others — Australia, New Zealand and the European Union — have only added Hezbollah's military wing to their terror lists.

The US has been calling for more pressure on Hezbollah as part of its sanctions against Iran, which it describes as the world's largest sponsor of terrorism. The US Ambassador in Lebanon last month suggested Hezbollah was fighting in at least three countries: Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Israel, a lifelong enemy of Hezbollah, applauded the UK move and urged the EU to do the same: ""All who truly wish to combat terror must reject the fake distinction between 'military' & 'political' wings,"" Gilad Erdan, Israel's security minister, said in a tweet.

(""Tahoe"") (TSX:THO) (NYSE: TAHO) today completed the previously announced transaction (the ""Arrangement"") whe…","VANCOUVER, Feb. 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - Pan American Silver Corp. (""Pan American"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: PAAS) (TSX:PAAS) and Tahoe Resources Inc. (""Tahoe"") (TSX:THO) (NYSE: TAHO) today completed the previously announced transaction (the ""Arrangement"") whereby Pan American acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Tahoe.

Michael Steinmann, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pan American Silver, said: ""The completion of the Arrangement establishes the world's premier silver mining company with an industry-leading portfolio of assets, a robust growth profile and attractive operating margins. We are also now the largest publicly traded silver mining company by free float, offering silver mining investors enhanced scale and liquidity.""

Added Mr. Steinmann: ""We have a 25-year track record in Latin America of building successful partnerships with the communities around our operations, respecting the diversity of local populations and safeguarding the natural environment. We welcome the opportunity to work with local communities around the new operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.""

Results of elections by Tahoe shareholders

Pursuant to the Arrangement, Tahoe shareholders had the right to elect to receive either US$3.40 in cash (the ""Cash Election"") or 0.2403 of a Pan American share (the ""Share Election"") for each Tahoe share, subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum cash consideration of US$275 million and a maximum number of Pan American shares issued of 56.0 million. Tahoe shareholders who did not make an election by the deadline of 4:30 pm EST on January 3, 2019 were deemed to have made the Share Election.

The following elections were made:

holders of 23,661,084 Tahoe shares made the Cash Election; and

holders of 290,226,406 Tahoe shares made, or were deemed to have made, the Share Election.

Since the aggregate number of Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration (as defined in the Arrangement agreement dated as of November 14, 2018 among Pan American, Tahoe and 0799714 B.C. Ltd.), holders of Tahoe shares who made or were deemed to have made the Share Election are subject to pro-ration in the manner described in Tahoe's management information circular dated December 4, 2018 and will receive consideration per Tahoe share of approximately 19.7% in cash (US$0.67) and approximately 80.3% in Pan American shares (0.1929 of a Pan American share). Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made will receive all cash consideration.

In addition, Tahoe shareholders received contingent consideration in the form of one contingent value right (""CVR"") for each Tahoe share. Each CVR will be exchanged for 0.0497 of a Pan American share upon first commercial shipment of concentrate following restart of operations at the Escobal mine. The CVRs are transferable and have a term of 10 years.

In aggregate, Pan American will pay US$275 million in cash and issue 55,990,512 Pan American shares and 313,887,490 CVRs to Tahoe shareholders under the Arrangement. Upon closing of the Arrangement, existing Pan American and former Tahoe shareholders own approximately 73% and 27% of Pan American, respectively. Upon satisfaction of the payment conditions under the terms of the CVRs, Pan American and Tahoe shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the combined company (based upon the number of Pan American shares outstanding as at today's date).

C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A Jeannes appointed to Pan American Board

Under the Arrangement, Tahoe was entitled to nominate two of its directors to join Pan American's Board of Directors. Tahoe has nominated Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes.

Increase to, and drawdown under, Pan American's revolving credit facility

Pan American is also pleased to announce that it has amended and extended its revolving credit facility led by The Bank of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The facility has been increased by US$200 million to US$500 million, and matures on February 1, 2023. At Pan American's option, amounts can be drawn under the revolving facility and will incur interest based on the Company's leverage ratio at either (i) LIBOR plus 1.875% to 2.750% or; (ii) The Bank of Nova Scotia's Base Rate on U.S. dollar denominated commercial loans plus 0.875% to 1.750%. Undrawn amounts under the revolving facility are subject to a stand-by fee of 0.4219% to 0.6188% per annum, dependent on the Company's leverage ratio.

Pan American has drawn down US$301 million under the facility under LIBOR-based interest rates to fund, in part, the cash purchase price under the Arrangement and to repay, in full, and cancel Tahoe's second amended and restated revolving facility, under which US$125 million had been drawn.

87,Empty,2019-02-25T19:25:53Z,US also to urge UN Security Council to call for ‘credible’ elections in crisis-hit country,"The United States hit Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

Washington also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking the body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The US treasury department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled president Nicolás Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the US.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogotá as US vice president Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaidó met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Mr Pence said the US would stand by Mr Guaidó until freedom was restored to the oil-rich nation. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Mr Maduro’s “henchmen” to Mr Guaidó’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming. “In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Mr Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

Mr Guaidó, sitting next to Mr Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as US-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Mr Guaidó, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Mr Maduro.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the US is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian deputy foreign minister Hugo de Zela Martínez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Border closure

Mr Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Mr Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful president.

Washington wants the 15-member UN Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and backs Mr Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Mr Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup against the Opec member.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Mr Maduro’s government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighboring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros”.

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia (34), walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay [to cross], so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don't know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the US Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of the state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Mr Lacava goes by the nickname “Dracula” in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos. – Reuters",Venezuela hit with new US sanctions after aid clashes,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/venezuela-hit-with-new-us-sanctions-after-aid-clashes-1.3806044

“Maduro declared in his February 4 Caracas speech: ‘Not one Yaqui soldier will enter Venezuela.’”

Is Trump contributing to a unique experience in protagonist democracy in Venezuela? If so, his administration and the Democratic Party supporting the U.S. elite’s Venezuela policy are in for a big surprise. On February 25, 2014 – five years ago! – BAR published my article titled “Obama’s Arrogant Interference in Venezuela and Resistance by a Participatory Democracy.” Over the five years of tampering, obstruction and suffocating sanctions, the Obama and Trump administrations have not been able to conquer Venezuela. Why?

The U.S.-centric mindset has been steeped in the white supremacist notion of the “chosen people” from the time of the Pilgrims. It consists, among other features, of the racist outlook that peoples in the “Third World,” such as Latin America, cannot take their destiny in their own hands. Since the publication of that piece five years ago, history — along with my experience during other short visits to Caracas and my close following of TeleSUR in both English and Spanish — has forced me to revise my appreciation of Venezuela’s unique experience in democracy. It has certainly gone up more than just a notch. As a result of U.S. policies, democracy in Venezuela has been crossing the Rubicon from participatory democracy to a protagonist one. While the two are similar, especially in comparison with the experience of the Diktat in the capitalist North, there is a qualitative difference. Any hesitation at this time to qualify Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution’s democracy as being “above all” – as Chávez predicted and desired – “protagonist and not only participatory” vanished on February 4, 2019 in Caracas.

“The main issue now is the right of Venezuela to its sovereignty and to choosing its own path without foreign interference.”

Many valuable articles have already been published in BAR concerning the legitimate election of Maduro in the last elections of May 2018 on the one hand and, on the other, regarding the violation of Venezuelan and international law, including the United Nations in “recognizing” its man in Caracas. Furthermore, the main issue now is the right of Venezuela to its sovereignty and to choosing its own path without foreign interference, irrespective of any other considerations. Moreover, within this optic, the principal reality – ignored by the international media – is the civilian military union as a key component of Venezuelan democracy. It is not recognized either by ignorance or by mere wishful thinking, as those who want to eliminate the Bolivarian Revolution know very well it is this union that blocks their plan.

Although it was not the first time that I had heard Maduro speak, his February 4 talk in that semi-private meeting with Venezuelans and foreign guests was a clincher. Among other points, he outlined in detail how he and the other leaders (whom I also met briefly in that meeting) have been and are today still working to organize and inspire — and in turn are being inspired by — all the sections of the armed forces all over the country, from pilots, navy to the army to the people’s militia. He pointed out that this civilian military union has been developing in the country over several decades.

“The principal reality is the civilian military union as a key component of Venezuelan democracy.”

To flesh this out, I would add that more recently in the 1990s Chávez spent considerable time and effort to build a civilian military union. The goal was to overthrow the U.S.- backed de facto dictatorship that had ruled for many decades through the “two-party system” — all too familiar to Americans — alternating from one discredited party to another… that also soon became disgraced and so on. On February 4, 1992, Chávez and other officers and civilian revolutionary leaders organized a coup to overthrow the corrupt wealthy political elite to be replaced by the Bolivarian principles of independence and social justice. It failed, but then Chávez returned from prison to declare to the people on state TV that “for the moment” [por ahora] the rebellion had failed. This now iconic image and perspective words had further cemented the union between the military and the civilian population who had never before seen a political-military leader ready to give his life for a new Venezuela.

This union rose to the fore again on April 13, 2002 when the civilian-military alliance brought Chavez back to power as the legitimate president after a short- lived US-backed coup executed on April 11, 2002.

“Maduro and the other leaders have been working to organize and inspire all the sections of the armed forces all over the country.”

What then is this civilian-military union, its history and tradition?

Chávez said that he found the idea of the civilian-military alliance in the political thought of the Venezuelan intellectual, guerrilla leader, Fabricio Ojeda, who wrote in his 1966 book La guerra del pueblo (The People’s War):

“The anti-feudal and anti-imperialist basis of our revolutionary process suggests a form of alliance that can accommodate differences in background, political credo, philosophical conception, religious convictions, economic or professional status, or party affiliation among Venezuelans. The strength and might of the common enemy calls for a united struggle to defeat it… The forces most inclined to fight for national liberation are the workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, students, intellectuals, and professionals as well as the majority of officials, Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), and soldiers of the air, sea, and land forces…” In Ojeda’s vision, which Chávez shared, all these civilian and military sectors are called upon to come together in a genuine national revolutionary alliance. (Ramonet, Ignacio, Hugo Chávez: Mi primera vida. Conversaciones con Ignacio Ramonet, Vintage Español, Nueva York, 2013. [Translation by Arnold August]).

“The civilian population had never before seen a political-military leader ready to give his life for a new Venezuela.”

Today, more than ever before, in the face of a potential U.S. military intervention, this feature of the people being the authors of their ownBolivarian Revolution, rather than just participants in it, Venezuela is displaying a protagonist democracy to the world. It can be the death knell to any military adventure.

The U.S. should not be mistaken. While Maduro declared in his February 4 Caracas speech to us that his government is ready to participate in any efforts at mediation, he also made clear that Venezuela is ready to defend its country: “Not one Yaqui soldier will enter Venezuela.”

The threat of U.S.-led military intervention is more real than ever. The issue for us all: No to military intervention in Venezuela and full support for the right of Venezuela to defend itself in the worse-case scenario. Polls in Europe and other countries show support for this position, while the main unions in Canada have issued and are issuing statements rejecting the pro-Trump position of the Justin Trudeau Liberal Party position and demonstrations are taking place in the U.S.

“The strength and might of the common enemy calls for a united struggle to defeat it.”

The Justin Trudeau government hosted the so-called Lima Group in Ottawa on that same day, February 4, when we were in Caracas meeting with the Maduro government leadership. The official communiqué reaffirmed its support for the Trump position on Venezuela, consisting of foreign interference in the internal affairs of that country with full support of its puppet as the so-called president. The position of the Justin Trudeau government is a major and historical (in the very negative sense of the term)changein Canadian foreign policy, including within his own Liberal Party.In contrast for example, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War (March 2013) former Liberal Party Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said in an interview regarding Canada’s position to NOT support the U.S. war in Iraq, that he [Chrétien]has no regrets about rejecting Canada’s participation in the U.S.-led mission. It was a very important decision, no doubt about it. It was, in fact, the first time ever that there was a war that the Brits and the Americans were involved, and Canada was not there, Chrétien told CTV’s [Canadian national news network] Power Play.

The move also helped assert Canada’s independence on the world stage, he said.

Unfortunately, a lot of people thought sometimes that we were the 51st state of America. It was clear that day that we were not.

“The main unions in Canada have issued and are issuing statements rejecting the pro-Trump position.”

Chrétien said he refused to commit to military action in Iraq without a resolution from the UN Security Council. He said Canada always followed the UN and intervened in other conflicts when asked to.

Chrétien also said he was not convinced that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction — the threat that fuelled support for a U.S.-led invasion of the country — and that turned out to be true.

Chrétien also addressed his visit to Venezuela last week [March 2013] (to attend President Hugo Chávez’s funeral).

He said he went because he knew Chávez personally and “never had any problem” with the controversial leader, even though he didn’t agree with him “on many things.” He also wanted to show his respect for the people of Venezuela.

He had support of the people and he was loved by the poor of his country. He was kind of a Robin Hood, Chrétien said.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper [of the Canadian Conservative Party] angered the Venezuelan administration by saying in a statement that he hoped the country can have a better, brighter future after Chávez’s death.

Chrétien said the Venezuelan authorities were very, very happy to see him at the funeral, because they were very unhappy with Harper’s remarks.

Let us recall what most political people in Cuba, Latin America, and many in the West know: Justin Trudeau’s own father, as Liberal Party Prime Minister of Canada, went to Cuba when he stood next to Fidel Castro in June 1976 and shouted in a public meeting “Long live Prime Minister Fidel Castro!,” and had taken other positions independent of the U.S.

“Everyone in Canada hates Trump for all his policies, yet Justin Trudeau is aligned with him.”

As the Canadian and other peoples increasingly recognize now, like any other family in whatever system, family relations and characteristics change. Regarding foreign relations, Justin Trudeau is not at all like his father. The press can quote me here as a Canadian: “Justin Trudeau’s father would turn over in his grave if he knew what his own son was doing.” Everyone in Canada hates Trump for all his policies, yet Justin Trudeau is aligned with him.

While the Trudeau government admonishes Venezuela for its supposed lack of democracy, it does not seem to recognize cynical incongruities, such as when, last January 2019 (while the Lima Group anti-Venezuela “pro-democracy “conspiration was in full swing), the Canadian government’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) — as part of the century-long racist colonial occupation of indigenous lands — arrested 14 native people and entered a fortified checkpoint on a forest service road in northern B.C., where people at the Gidimt’en camp were barring a pipeline company from access (CBC). That led to more protests (YouTube: Toronto Star).

“Democracy” in the North is one thing. The constantly developing protagonist democracy in Venezuela is entirely the opposite. Furthermore, it is the main shield to defend the fledgling Bolivarian socialist path against U.S.-led foreign interference which we must all fully oppose.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is visiting Beijing on a tour of Asia just a month after a Saudi woman hit global headlines by barricading herself in a Bangkok airport hotel to avoid being sent home to her family.

“These brave, young, intelligent women have been living in fear, in hiding and in legal limbo in Hong Kong, not knowing what their future holds,” their lawyer, Michael Vidler, said in a statement on Thursday.

But the sisters, aged 18 and 20, whose identity Mr Vidler did not reveal, were intercepted by officials during their stopover in the Asian financial hub, before they managed to escape and enter the city as visitors, he said.

The women, who have been in hiding in the former British colony for the last five months, told the lawyer their connecting flight to Australia was cancelled and the officials tried to put them on a flight to the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

Mr Vidler said the sisters learnt that the officials who intercepted them were Saudi Arabia's consul general and vice consul general in Hong Kong, but did not explain how they came by the information.

The Saudi consulate in Hong Kong did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on Friday.

“We fled our home to ensure our safety,” the women said in the statement.

“We hope that we can be given asylum in a country which recognises women's rights and treats them as equals. We dream of being in a safe place where we can be normal young women, free from violence and oppression.”

Since September, the sisters have changed location 13 times, fearing for their safety, Mr Vidler said.

In November, the Hong Kong Immigration Department told them their Saudi passports had been invalidated and they could only stay in the city until 28 February.

Police in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said only that they had received a report from “two expatriate women” and were investigating, but did not elaborate.

The Hong Kong Immigration Department said it would not comment on individual cases.

The incident, and the January case of the barricaded 18-year-old, since granted asylum in Canada, spotlights Saudi Arabia's strict social rules that require women to secure travel permission from a male “guardian”, which rights groups say can leave them trapped as prisoners of abusive families.

Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of a journalist at its Istanbul consulate in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.

“The situation in Venezuela worsens every day and our concern about the end of this crisis also increases. The rejection of humanitarian aid is incomprehensible.

Speaking in Colombia on Monday, Pence repeated President Trump’s threat that “all options are on the table” to push out embattled socialist leader Nicolas Maduro, whose re-election is considered invalid by the U.S. and dozens of other countries.

""It's time to do more,"" said Pence. ""The day is coming soon when Venezuela's long nightmare will end, when Venezuela will once more be free, when her people will see a new birth of freedom, in a nation reborn to libertad.""

Pence was speaking at a meeting with the regional leaders in the Lima Group — a 14-nation coalition of mostly conservative Latin American nations and Canada that has joined together to pressure Maduro.

“We are with you 100 percent,” Pence said ahead of the start of the meeting. “I was to assure you, President Guaido, the tragic events of this past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States to stand with you … We will keep standing until your libertad is restored.”

Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself interim head of state and triggered a power struggle in the South American country, was also in attendance. He asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend and urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

POMPEO URGES VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES TO LET HUMANITARIAN AID INTO THE COUNTRY: 'DO THE RIGHT THING'

Meanwhile, the Trump administration slapped financial sanctions against Maduro allies.

The Treasury Department announced Monday measures against four governors: Omar Prieto of Zulia, Ramon Carrizales of Apure, Jorge Garcia Carneiro of Vargas and Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state.

“The United States will not stand idly while the people of Venezuela are denied basic necessities and made to suffer needlessly. These actions have consequences,” the department said in a statement. “We reaffirm our call on Venezuelan officials and security forces to allow urgently needed food and medicine to enter and be distributed throughout the country.”

VENEZUELAN TROOPS ABANDON POSTS AMID VIOLENT CLASHES WITH PROTESTERS AT COLOMBIAN BORDER

Violent clashes broke out over the weekend across the Colombia-Venezuela border – at least four protesters died while more than 300 were injured as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Trucks were met with tear gas and rubber bullets and at least two went up in flames, which the opposition blamed on security forces and the Venezuelan government on “drugged-up protesters.”

UN CONDEMNS VENEZUELA VIOLENCE, 'APPEALS FOR CALM'

For weeks, the U.S. and regional allies had been amassing emergency food and medical kits on Venezuela's borders in anticipation of carrying out a ""humanitarian avalanche"" by land and sea to undermine Maduro's rule.

The embattled Maduro has denied a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and claimed that aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup attempt against the OPEC member.

Pence announced Monday that the U.S. would be sending another $56 million to neighbors of Venezuela to help them cope with migrants fleeing the nation’s deepening crisis.

The U.S. has already provided more than $139 million in aid to help Venezuela, Pence announced.

At the United Nations, the U.S. has asked the UN Security Council to meet to discuss the crisis in Venezuela, pushing the 15-member block to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

‘CREDIBLE THREATS’

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogotá, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

CALL FOR AMNESTY

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”",Venezuela hit with new U.S. sanctions after aid clashes,Reuters,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1QE28F

THE BIG IDEA: Barack Obama opposed reparations for the descendants of slavery when he ran for president. He warned the NAACP in 2007 that they would be used as “an excuse for some to say we’ve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work” of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, improving public education, rehabilitating young men coming out of prisons and lifting people out of poverty.

In 2016, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders supported reparations for the black community as a redress for slavery. Even as he promised a revolution of democratic socialism that would include tuition-free college and Medicare-for-all, Sanders said paying reparations to African Americans was a bridge too far. “First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil,” he said. “Second of all, I think it would be very divisive.”

But this is not your father’s Democratic Party, and it’s not 2016 anymore.

Four declared Democratic presidential candidates have signaled support for some form of reparations to specifically benefit African Americans: Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Julián Castro and Marianne Williamson. This puts more pressure on the rest of the crowded field to endorse race-conscious policies and could provide fresh fodder for President Trump to portray his 2020 challengers as outside the mainstream.

In the modern political sense, the term “reparations” is a little like “socialism.” It means very different things to different people, and the devil is in the details. Many think of direct cash payments to African Americans when they hear the word. Others think more broadly of investments that are specifically made by the government to lift communities of color. What one person calls reparations someone else might just describe as strengthening the social safety net. The fact that candidates are willing to use the term at all after generations of Democratic standard-bearers have seemed allergic to it reflects a sea change.

Like other issues where the Democratic Party is lurching leftward lately, such as the widespread embrace of the Green New Deal, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is once again driving the pace car. She expressed support for exploring the idea of reparations last month, using the pulpit that has come with her celebrity to move the issue to the front burner. “People think reparations is reparations for slavery, but really, economically speaking, reparations are for the damage done by the New Deal and redlining because that is where we saw a compounding of the existing inequity from the legacy of slavery, where we drew red lines around black communities,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

-- Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday became the latest candidate to jump on the reparations bandwagon. “We must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations,” the senator said in a statement to the New York Times. “We need systemic, structural changes to address that.”

-- Castro expressed openness to reparations in an interview with the Root, a publication that caters to an African American audience, that also published yesterday. “I have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that,” said the former secretary of housing and urban development. “I don’t find the notion challenging. What I do find challenging is the best way to do that.”

-- Harris (D-Calif.) said “yes” last week when asked explicitly whether she supports “some form of reparations for black people.” “Well, look, I think that we have got to address that,” the senator said during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” a radio show popular with African Americans. “Again, it goes back to the inequities. … We have got to recognize that and give people a lift up. And there are a number of ways to do it.”

Harris mentioned a bill she’s introduced called the LIFT Act to help people making less than $100,000 a year. “What I want to do about rent is the same thing,” she added. “What we need to do around education and understanding disparities. What we need to do around [historically black colleges and universities]. But we have a history of racism in America.”

-- The Democrat who has been most specific is Williamson, a spiritual guru who is waging a spirited long-shot campaign for the nomination that’s been capturing more attention recently. “Williamson traces many of our nation’s psychic wounds to slavery, for which she believes we need to make reparations in the form of a $100 billion, 10-year investment disseminated by a panel of black leaders across fields,” Anna Peele writes in a profile that will run in our magazine this Sunday.

“When I wonder, sitting at a table in a Los Angeles neighborhood where the average home sells for $1.66 million, how she will enact her plan for reparations without seeming like a well-meaning white lady, Williamson crosses her arms and starts clomping the heel of her left foot like a dressage horse,” Peele reports. “‘I am a well-meaning white lady,’ she says, utterly exasperated. ‘Why should I apologize for being a well-meaning white lady? What is going on in this world today? I shouldn’t apologize for being white any more than you should apologize for being black.’ (I am not black, just another well-meaning white lady.) ‘I’ve been leading ritualized apologies — prayers of apology — from whites to blacks for over 20 years. I wrote a book [‘Healing the Soul of America’] on this topic. This is not something that I just came new to. I was talking about this long before it was trending.’”

-- “Other Democratic 2020 candidates … either did not respond to requests for comment or stopped short of an endorsement of reparations. Instead, several laid out policies that, though not intended as a redress for slavery, would benefit black Americans,” Astead Herndon writes in today’s Times. “Senator Cory Booker’s ‘baby bonds’ policy aims to help poorer children by giving them a government-funded savings account that could total up to $50,000 for the lowest income brackets. … And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has endorsed a proposal to allow Americans without checking accounts to bank at the local post office; a disproportionate percentage of America’s unbanked population are people of color.

“The Warren campaign declined to give further details on [her statement endorsing reparations], but it came amid her calls for the federal government to provide special home-buying assistance to residents of communities that were adversely affected by ‘redlining,’ the discriminatory practice of denying mortgages, usually in poor and nonwhite areas. She also announced a sweeping universal child-care proposal that could strongly benefit minority communities that often have limited early childhood services.”

As people noted how relatively vague the quotes were from Harris and Warren, Herndon tweeted that he “made it clear to campaigns that ‘policies that help black people’ did not count as reparations, but would have to be intentionally race-specific and meant to address past harms – not lift all boats.” He added that the Harris campaign did nothing to walk back her comments on “The Breakfast Club.”

“We have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,” Harris said in a statement. “I’m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities.”

-- Overwhelming majorities of Americans have consistently been opposed to the concept of reparations. Polling analyst Emily Guskin notes that the most recent survey she could find, a Point Taken-Marist poll from 2016, found that 68 percent said the U.S. government should not pay the descendants of slaves and that 72 percent said the U.S. should not pay African Americans in general. Racial differences were significant: 81 percent of whites opposed giving any monetary compensation to descendants of slaves, compared with 35 percent of African Americans and 47 percent of Latinos. A Kaiser-CNN poll from 2015 found 77 percent said the U.S. should not pay descendants of slaves, also with large differences by race.

Even when the questions were worded slightly differently, the findings have been relatively similar and stayed somewhat consistent over the past few decades. A 2002 survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today found 81 percent said the government should not make cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves. A 1997 ABC poll found 77 percent believed the federal government should not pay black Americans whose ancestors were slaves.

-- Bottom line: Get ready to hear the r-word a lot on the campaign trail over the next 20 months, mainly from Republicans who will use it to try painting Democrats as far-left and out-of-touch extremists.

Offering a taste of what’s sure to come, Tucker Carlson devoted an entire segment of his show on Fox News last night to ripping Democrats over reparations. The host even quipped that Warren might be endorsing the idea because she is “under the influence of peyote,” a drug associated with Native Americans.

His guest, conservative commentator Mark Steyn, went further. He said it’s “disturbing” that the idea is becoming a “mainstream” position. “Slavery was abolished a century and a half ago,” Steyn said on Fox. “Nobody alive today has a grandparent who was a slave. And, in that sense, I think you reach a point where you need to move on. The reparations thing eventually, as the decades goes by, becomes ridiculous.”

-- Based on the polls and the mood of the country, it seems like a safe bet that any Democrat who endorses the concept of reparations right now – however generically – will face immense political pressure to walk back their comments – at least somewhat – in the context of a general election.

-- During an interview in his final year as president, Obama expounded at length on why endorsing reparations is bad politics. “It is easy to make that theoretical argument,” Obama told Ta-Nehisi Coates, an outspoken advocate for reparations, during an interview that appeared in the Atlantic. “But as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation’s resources over a long period of time to make that right.

“You can look at examples like postwar Germany, where reparations were paid to Holocaust victims and families, but they lost the war,” Obama added. “Small population, finite amount of money that it was going to cost. Not multiple generations but people, in some cases, who are still alive, who can point to, ‘That was my house. Those were my paintings. Those were my mother’s family jewels.’ If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn’t come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it’s hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.

“And what makes America complicated as well is the degree to which this is not just a black/white society, and it is becoming less so every year,” the then-president continued. “So how do Latinos feel if there’s a big investment just in the African American community, and they’re looking around and saying, ‘We’re poor as well. What kind of help are we getting?’ Or Asian Americans who say, ‘Look, I’m a first-generation immigrant, and clearly I didn’t have anything to do with what was taking place.’ And now you start getting into trying to calibrate. …

“I’m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments above and beyond the kinds of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people,” he concluded. “So to restate it: I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader’s ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow. Now, we can debate the justness of that. But I feel pretty confident in that assessment politically.”

-- The White House announced that the United States will leave behind 200 “peacekeeping” troops in Syria for an unspecified amount of time beyond the planned withdrawal of American forces this spring. Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan report: “A U.S. official ... said that the 200 would be 'split down the middle' between Syrian Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast of the country, and the Tanf garrison in southeast Syria. The official said the total might rise slightly. The decision was a partial reversal of President Trump’s order, announced in December, that all 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria would leave, since their mission to destroy the Islamic State caliphate, in his view, had been achieved. Complete withdrawal was expected by the end of April. ... Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) praised the move Thursday and said that the residual U.S. force would 'ensure that ISIS does not return and that Iran does not fill the vacuum that would have been left if we completely withdrew.' It also ensures, he said, that Turkey and the Syrian Kurds 'will not go into conflict.'""

Mark Harris testifies Thursday during a hearing on voting irregularities in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. (Travis Long/Raleigh News & Observer/AP)

-- North Carolina elections officials ordered a new contest in the 9th Congressional District after a months-long investigation into alleged ballot tampering. Amy Gardner reports: “The board voted unanimously to throw out the November results between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready after Harris, an evangelical minister from Charlotte, admitted under oath that he was mistaken in his testimony earlier in the day. Harris blamed the error on a recent sepsis infection that he said caused two strokes and affected his memory. … Harris was under scrutiny for hiring a political operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless, who allegedly assembled a crew of election workers to illegally collect, fill out and forge mail-in ballots in two rural counties in the 9th District. …

“Thursday’s abrupt bipartisan conclusion to what had been a deeply rancorous process offered hope to some who believe the kind of fraud alleged in the 9th District often goes undetected and unprosecuted — leaving rural and often impoverished communities without fair elections or representation. … Later, the board will set a date for a new election, probably including primaries. McCready has begun preparing for a new election and is expected to run again. It appeared less likely that Harris, who had led in unofficial returns by 905 votes, would do so.”

-- Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said he has nothing to apologize for and plans to run for reelection despite the controversy over his history of racist remarks that has gotten him stripped of his committee assignments in Congress. The Des Moines Register’s Tony Leys reports: “King confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination. He offered a message to voters in his northwest Iowa district: ‘Don’t let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who’s going to represent you in the United States Congress.’

“King blamed his troubles on media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which he accused of twisting his words and ‘weaponizing’ the language. ‘If you would just hold these publications to what is true, there is no story whatsoever,’ he said. ‘… There’s no part of me that believes in anything that’s advocated by folks that identify themselves as white nationalists or white supremacy.’”

The congressman also said he doesn’t think being on a committee matters much since the House is controlled by the Democrats: “‘If there’s ever going to be a time not to have committee assignments, this time with Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House is the time,’ he said.”

-- A federal judge in Florida ruled that a 2007 plea deal between Jeffrey Epstein, a politically connected billionaire accused of molesting dozens of young girls, and federal prosecutors in Miami, including Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, violated the law. Mark Berman reports: “The ruling was a stinging rebuke for prosecutors and how they behaved in a grim, high-profile case that has drawn increased scrutiny in recent months. A Miami Herald investigation last year highlighted the allegations and Acosta’s role in cutting a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein, while a Justice Department office said it is exploring whether the federal prosecutors who reached the deal committed ‘professional misconduct.’ ...

“District Judge Kenneth A. Marra was blunt, ruling that prosecutors had acted improperly in reaching the agreement with Epstein — which stopped federal action in exchange for him pleading guilty to a state charge — without telling the victims. Marra, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., wrote in a 33-page ruling that the actions violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), which entitles victims to know about significant events in their cases. Marra wrote that he was ‘not ruling that the decision not to prosecute was improper,’ noting he was ‘simply ruling that, under the facts of this case, there was a violation of the victims rights under the CVRA'”

Acosta’s spokesman at the Labor Department pointed to the Justice Department’s long-standing defense of how prosecutors handled the case. “For more than a decade, the actions of the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida in this case have been defended by the Department of Justice in litigation across three administrations and several attorneys general,” the spokesman said. “The office’s decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed departmental procedures.” The U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida, which Acosta led between 2005 and 2009, declined to comment.

-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who is flirting with a challenge to Trump in 2020, accused the Republican National Committee of taking “unprecedented” steps to shield the president from primary challengers. Ovetta Wiggins reports: “Hogan, who is being courted by Republican dissidents seeking an alternative to Trump, told Politico in an interview that he was disgusted by RNC efforts to close ranks around Trump and troubled by reports that Republicans in South Carolina were considering scrapping their primary altogether. ‘I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life,’ Hogan told Politico reporter Alex Isenstadt. ‘In my opinion, it’s not the way we should be going about our politics.’”

Why you should take this seriously: Hogan will take over as chairman of the National Governors Association during its meeting in D.C. this weekend. That gives him a bigger platform when he travels to Iowa early next month, where he’ll probably hold meetings with activists and political types. The governor’s spokeswoman also confirms Hogan plans to make a springtime visit to New Hampshire.

A DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who was allegedly plotting a domestic terrorism attack, was caught after he conducted suspicious searches using government computers to study the manifestos and methods of mass shooters. He was arrested at work last Friday after being detected by an internal Coast Guard program that watches for any “insider threat.” Lynh Bui, Dan Lamothe and Michael Miller report: “The program identified suspicious computer activity tied to Hasson, prompting the agency’s investigative service to launch an investigation last fall, said Lt. Cmdr. Scott McBride, a service spokesman. ... He researched how to carry out sniper attacks, [prosecutors] contend, and whether rifle scopes were illegal. … As he built an arsenal, prosecutors contend, Hasson read manifestos by the Unabomber, the Virginia Tech shooter and the Olympic Park bomber among other domestic mass shooters, and also looked for guidance to the plot of right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who in 2011 unleashed two attacks in Norway that killed 77 people. … And all the while, investigators assert, he was amassing a cache of weapons.” He also had a secret-level clearance.

“Hasson’s federal public defender, Julie Stelzig, said … there was ‘no actual indication of any plan.’ She said that Hasson had no prior record and that the number of weapons he had were ‘modest at best’ for average gun collectors. ‘It’s not a crime to think negative thoughts,’ Stelzig said ... ‘It’s not a crime to think about doomsday scenarios.’”

-- Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) acknowledged that he wore a Confederate uniform as a student at Auburn after a picture emerged from his 1980 college yearbook. Lee confirmed to the Tennessean newspaper that he wore the uniform at an “Old South” party. ""‘Although I have never acted to intentionally hurt anyone, I have the benefit of 40 years of hindsight to see that participating was insensitive and I’ve come to regret it,’ Lee said. A Lee spokesman added that the governor has never worn blackface,” Felicia Sonmez reports.

-- “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett faces up to three years in prison for allegedly staging a fake attack on himself and filing a false police report. Bethonie Butler, Sonia Rao and Alex Horton report: “Smollett’s bond was set at $100,000 at a court hearing Thursday afternoon, during which Cook County Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. also directed Smollett to surrender his passport. … Prosecutors have identified the [two men Smollett allegedly paid to attack him] as brothers Abimbola ‘Abel’ Osundairo and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo. They say Smollett and Abel Osundairo were close friends who worked together on ‘Empire,’ where Abel was a stand-in for a love interest of Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon. Prosecutors also say Abel had been ‘a source of designer drugs’ including molly, a form of MDMA, for Smollett since spring 2018. They say Smollett met Ola Osundairo, who appeared as an extra on ‘Empire,’ ‘on several occasions through Abel.’

“At a media briefing Thursday morning, Chicago police said Smollett concocted the story of a brutal hate crime because he was ‘dissatisfied with his salary’ on the Fox drama. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the department has a $3,500 check Smollett paid the men to help him stage the fake attack after a crude, threatening letter he sent to the ‘Empire’ set in Chicago failed to get attention. Johnson was remarkably forceful in his remarks about the case, which has gained widespread media attention since Smollett told police he was attacked in the city last month. Johnson, a black Chicago native, said the actor ‘took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.’ ...

“Prosecutors allege that Smollett, 36, was the guiding force behind the staged attack — right down to the intersection where it took place. They say Smollett told the Osundairo brothers, who are of Nigerian descent, to call his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and say, ‘This is MAGA country.’ They also say Smollett provided a $100 bill for supplies including rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball hats resembling the ‘Make America Great Again’ hats associated with [Trump’s] campaign. According to prosecutors, Smollett coordinated the plan around a trip the brothers had planned to Nigeria.”

-- Trump said Smollett “insulted” his supporters with the fake attack. “@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA,” the president wrote in a tweet.

-- Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) said Smollett’s allegedly fake attack made it harder for real hate-crime victims to be believed. Felicia Sonmez reports: “Late last month, when Smollett first told Chicago police that he was attacked, Rush sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray asking for a hate crimes investigation into the incident. On Thursday, the Illinois Democrat said that it is now clear that the attack ‘was a total and complete lie.’ ‘I am beyond disappointed and extremely infuriated at Smollett’s brazen, devious, and disgraceful behavior,’ Rush said in a statement. … ‘I hope that Smollett is aware that his stunt has made it harder for real victims to be believed and has caused them to relive their victimization, both from being attacked and from having their stories called into question,’ he said.”

-- Smollett’s case put some 2020 candidates in a tight spot after they quickly decried what they at first thought was a homophobic, hate-filled attack. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “After Smollett reported the alleged attack to police in January, weighing it with political import by claiming his assailants chanted President Trump’s campaign slogan, Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand quickly decried what they deemed a clear hate crime. Smollett’s case, Harris and Booker said in separate tweets, was an attempted ‘modern day lynching,’ while Gillibrand called it ‘a sickening and outrageous attack. But as questions began to emerge about Smollett’s account, the three Democratic contenders faced uncomfortable questions about whether they were too quick to make a judgment and utter words of condemnation.""

-- Despite his arrest, Smollett was back at work on “Empire” last night. The New York Times's John Koblin reports: “There are still two episodes left to be shot over the next month for the show’s fifth season ... When Mr. Smollett returned to work on Thursday he was prepared to film scenes from the season’s second-to-last episode ... It is still an open question whether Fox will use the footage when the episodes ultimately air. 'Empire' has not yet been renewed for a sixth season, so its ultimate fate still hangs in the balance. ... Complicating matters is the fact that 20th Century Fox Television — the studio that produces 'Empire' — is weeks away from being folded into the Walt Disney Company after Disney’s deal to purchase many of Fox’s entertainment assets finally closes. How Disney feels about Mr. Smollett will become a more urgent question in the weeks ahead.""

Roger Stone leaves a courthouse in D.C. on Thursday after a federal judge imposed a full gag order. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Gagged: A federal judge ordered longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone to no longer speak publicly about the case against him. Rachel Weiner and Manuel Roig-Franzia report: “Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington said it would be ‘foolhardy’ to wait for Stone to transgress again in the wake of an Instagram post that appeared to show her photo near crosshairs. … ‘I’m not giving you another chance,’ Jackson told Stone. ‘I have serious doubts whether you’ve learned any lesson at all.’ If he violates the order in any way, Jackson warned, she will order him to jail. The judge, who sounded flabbergasted by Stone’s explanations, rejected his claim that the image was not meant to be threatening. ‘Roger Stone knows full well the power of words and the power of symbols. There is nothing ambiguous about crosshairs,’ she said. …

“Stone took the stand during the hearing to apologize for the post … ‘Thank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,’ she said. … Both Jackson and prosecutor Jonathan Kravis grilled Stone on how he found the image and why he posted it. Stone gave inconsistent answers, saying first that it was posted by a volunteer and then that a volunteer sent him the image but he posted it himself. He said he can’t remember who gave him the picture or the names of everyone who has access to his phone. ‘How hard is it to find an image without crosshairs?’ an incredulous Jackson asked Stone. … Jackson also repeatedly asked Stone why, if he immediately regretted the posting, he went on to defend it in media interviews. … Stone said the apology was drafted by his attorneys and signed by him during a doctor’s appointment and that he had not read it carefully.”

-- An IRS analyst was charged with leaking government documents on financial transactions made by Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen. Devlin Barrett reports: “John Fry, an investigative analyst with the IRS in San Francisco, was charged with the unauthorized disclosure of suspicious-activity reports, or SARs. Such reports are meant to flag potentially unlawful financial conduct to government investigators but do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. According to the court documents, unsealed in federal court in San Francisco, Fry is accused of sharing the reports’ contents with Michael Avenatti … Court records show [Fry] appeared briefly in court Thursday and was released on a $50,000 bond. … Avenatti, who made the information public by posting it on social media, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. He said on Twitter that he did nothing wrong.”

-- Special counsel Bob Mueller’s report on his probe, which is expected to be delivered in the coming weeks, could serve as a “road map” for investigations by House Democrats, Obama’s former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal writes in the New York Times: “The report is unlikely to be a dictionary-thick tome, which will disappoint some observers. But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite. … The president’s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack.”

-- A year after Trump was sworn in, his inaugural committee drafted a document to address building questions about how it raised and spent a record amount of money. Bloomberg News’s Caleb Melby reports: “One question was particularly tricky. ‘What did Rick Gates have to do with [the Presidential Inaugural Committee]?’ staffers wrote in a late January draft. ‘[Need answer.]’ The draft document … shows how the group prepared to defend its work as questions intensified about its reported $107 million haul. According to nine inaugural staffers and others familiar with the committee’s efforts, the process of planning for Trump’s big week was chaotic and opaque, dominated by staff culled from Colony Capital, the real estate firm founded by [Chairman Tom] Barrack, and by ex-Trump campaign chairman [Paul] Manafort’s circle of associates.”

-- Members of the inaugural committee expressed concern about several vendors’ budgets in the weeks before Trump’s swearing-in. The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Davis O’Brien and Rebecca Ballhaus report: “Less than a month before the inauguration, in an email to colleagues, Heather Martin, the committee’s budget director, questioned the budget submitted by a top vendor, event-production company Hargrove Inc. The company, she wrote, was using ‘wildly different pricing’ from its work on previous inaugurals. She noted ‘redundancy’ and ‘excessively high’ prices for labor, centerpieces and even bike racks. It was one of several vendor budgets—including one submitted by WIS Media Partners, a firm run by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump—that was questioned by inaugural organizers, according to the records reviewed by the Journal.” Federal prosecutors are probing the committee’s communications with vendors.

-- Republicans on the House Oversight Committee accused Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) of making “extremely unfair and unsupported accusations” in a letter to the White House Counsel’s Office. Tom Hamburger reports: “In that letter, Cummings said that lawyers for [Trump] ‘may have provided false information’ to federal ethics officials about the president’s reimbursements to [Cohen] for payments Cohen had made to an adult film actress. The Republicans complained Thursday that Cummings had misinterpreted documents he obtained from the Office of Government Ethics and, as a result, unfairly accused the lawyers of misrepresenting facts about the Cohen payments.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) penned a Post op-ed calling on his Republican colleagues to criticize Trump for contributing to “the decline in public confidence in our institutions.” He writes: “Many of you have acknowledged your deep misgivings about the president in quiet conversations over the past two years. You have bemoaned his lack of decency, character and integrity. You have deplored his fundamental inability to tell the truth. But for reasons that are all too easy to comprehend, you have chosen to keep your misgivings and your rising alarm private. That must end. The time for silent disagreement is over. You must speak out.”

-- California’s public pension fund was one of the biggest investors in the National Enquirer’s parent company during the 2016 election. The LA Times’s Matt Pearce reports: “Through an investment managed by a New Jersey hedge fund, California’s public pension fund appears to have owned as much as one-third of [American Media Inc.] in 2016. It is not clear whether CalPERS continues to hold a major stake in the tabloid publisher.”

-- The Trump White House has directed interns to sign nondisclosure agreements while warning that leaking to the media could result in severe legal and financial consequences. The Daily Beast’s Asawin Suebsaeng reports: “Interns were also told that they would not receive their own copies, [people familiar with the process] said. This was all a standard facet of the Trump intern orientation process, billed as an ‘ethics training’—underscored by implicit legal threats from [Trump’s] in-house lawyers. … To veterans of other administrations, the act of compelling interns to sign these types of NDAs would seem odd, if not downright unenforceable or legally dubious.”

-- A lobbying firm run by former Trump advisers is representing a Russian-backed U.S. energy company that has connections to a Chinese aluminum production company. From NBC News’s Brian Schwartz: “Turnberry Solutions, a lobbying group run by former Trump campaign advisor Jason Osborne, has signed American Ethane as a client, according to a new lobbying disclosure form. The filing was posted on the Senate lobbying disclosure website on Tuesday. The document shows that Osborne and Ryan O'Dwyer, who previously was a special assistant to the secretary of Agriculture and a senior public liaison to Trump's inaugural committee, will be the lobbyists representing American Ethane on trade and energy issues. American Ethane touts a contract it signed with the Nanshan Group, an aluminum production company based in China. The development also comes as the Trump administration is engaged in high-stakes trade talks with the Chinese government.”

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- The dwindling number of migrants trying to cross the southern border has had a severe impact on American farmers, who rely on undocumented immigrants for cheap labor. Kevin Sieff and Annie Gowen report: “To fill those positions, employers have turned to temporary visa programs that recruit workers in Mexico and Central America. Since 2016, the number of U.S. agricultural visas has grown from 165,000 to 242,000, a record high, according to the Labor Department. Amid an intractable debate over immigration and border security, America’s labor force is quietly being transformed, as many employers see no choice but to shift from illegal to legal labor. … Despite his claim that immigrants take jobs away from Americans, [Trump] has touted the guest worker program, acknowledging the difficulty in finding American manual laborers and pledging to make it easier for farmers to hire workers legally.”

-- The Trump administration is advancing plans to withhold work permits from the spouses of high-skilled visa holders. The San Francisco Chronicle’s Tal Kopan reports: “At issue are work permits for nearly 100,000 immigrants who are here with spouses working on a high-tech visa and seeking a green card. … In 2015, the Obama administration created the H-4 employment authorization document, or H-4 EAD as it’s commonly known, to allow those spouses to work until the family can get green cards. … Since going into effect, there have been more than 90,000 immigrants approved for work permits under the program. [Trump] pledged early on to rescind the H-4 permit program, but the administration has been delayed in doing so.”

-- Fact check: Trump tweeted a video of construction at the border as evidence of his wall being built. But the video shows the replacement of existing fencing at the border. The New York Times’s Michael Tackett reports: “The money for the steel-slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017, not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown, or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week.”

-- The end of an immigration relief program means hundreds of Liberians living in the U.S. will have to choose between becoming undocumented or going back to Liberia, leaving their American children behind. Orion Donovan-Smith reports: Liberian immigrants “were given temporary permission to stay in the United States in 1999, when President Bill Clinton implemented ‘deferred enforced departure.’ DED was routinely extended by previous administrations but is set to end under Trump’s effort to terminate programs for immigrants without permanent status … Without a change of heart from the president — or new legislation from Congress — Liberians living in the United States under DED will lose their work authorization and become subject to deportation. Instead of self-deporting, many are expected to stay in the United States in hopes of getting a hearing in immigration courts, a process that could take years.”

-- The ACLU wants the Trump administration to determine how many children were separated from their parents at the border, a request White House lawyers said would be hard to comply with. Maria Sacchetti and Tony Perry report: The lawyers “said it would be extremely difficult to retrace the steps of all children who were separated but then released to parents or vetted sponsors. Justice Department lawyer Scott Stewart said that reuniting the 2,700-plus children, who were in federal custody when he ordered the Trump administration to find their parents, had taken eight months. Going back to a larger group, he said, would ‘blow the case into some other galaxy of a task.’”

Federal judge Dana M. Sabraw, who last summer ordered the White House to return all separated children in federal custody to their parents, did not immediately rule on the request. But he said it's critical to know where every child went: “Government officials urged Sabraw in court filings to deny the ACLU’s request, saying the children separated before his order already have been released from federal custody to a legal sponsor. Those children are ‘in a different legal position’ than those covered in the ACLU lawsuit, the government argued in court documents, adding that Sabraw should not allow the ACLU to ‘move the goal posts at this late date.’ ‘The government has worked hard and in good faith over the last eight months to comply with the Court’s orders and to facilitate the reunification process for class members,’ the Justice Department said in a court filing.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Opposition leaders in Venezuela predict violence to break out tomorrow, when volunteers are expected to try to break President Nicolás Maduro’s blockade of international relief. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “Maduro on Thursday ordered the closure of the border with Brazil and weighed sealing the border with Colombia ... as his government scrambled to respond to the planned Saturday operation. … A month after opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a usurper and claimed to be Venezuela’s rightful leader, the government’s enemies were in the midst of a risky gambit. By bus, car, boat, plane, motorbike and foot, thousands of Venezuelans, including Guaidó, were already mobilizing and heading toward the borders. Their plan: to force open Venezuela’s doors by force of numbers.”

-- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Venezuelan troops have started disobeying Maduro’s orders. “Saturday’s a day when we’re going to find a lot about the Maduro regime,” Rubio said of the planned aid delivery this weekend. “I have reason to believe that rank-and-file military are not going to violently suppress aid workers.” (Bloomberg News)

-- Venezuela's former chief of military intelligence declared his support for Guaidó, telling Maduro, ""It's been more than enough."" The Wall Street Journal's Ryan Dube and Kejal Vyas report: “Hugo Carvajal, a retired general and current congressman for the ruling Socialist Party, called for authorities to allow into Venezuela the humanitarian aid that the U.S. is stockpiling on the Colombian border. ... Mr. Carvajal, who spent more than three decades in Venezuela’s military, also had a sobering message for active troops, many of whom have been appearing in propaganda videos meant to rile up nationalist sentiment against what the Maduro regime says is an imminent U.S. invasion.”

-- The vice president will travel to Colombia on Monday to meet with Latin American leaders about the deepening crisis in Venezuela. Anne Gearan reports: “Pence’s office said he would ‘voice the United States’ unwavering support for [Guaidó] and highlight the Venezuelan people’s fight for democracy over dictatorship.’ The address to a diplomatic consortium known as the Lima Group comes as Guaidó has promised a weekend mobilization against Maduro and in support of delivery of food and medical supplies to Venezuelans facing severe shortages and hunger.”

-- An American detained in Russia on spy charges will be held for an extra three months. Amie Ferris-Rotman reports: “A Moscow court on Friday extended by three months custody of Paul Whelan, an American citizen charged with espionage, meaning he will stay behind bars through late May. The request came from Russia’s security services, who detained the 48-year-old former Marine in late December, seizing him at his Moscow hotel room during what his family described was a personal trip to see friends. Whelan’s lawyer, Vladi­mir Zherebenkov, had previously said his client was unwittingly handed a flash drive containing a 'state secret,' but no other official details have emerged in a case that has been dogged by murkiness and delays in standard procedure.”

-- A U.S.-born woman who joined the Islamic State and who the president said is not welcome back in America must be allowed to return home, a lawsuit filed on her behalf states. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The lawyer suing the U.S. government for her return says Hoda Muthana, 24, deserves more than a letter announcing her denaturalization. 'And certainly,’ said Charles Swift, a former Navy commander and the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, 'more than a tweet.'""

-- China used American expertise from a Yale researcher and a Massachusetts firm to create a system of surveillance that uses DNA to track down its own people. The New York Times's Sui-Lee Wee reports: “China wants to make the country’s Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, more subservient to the Communist Party. It has detained up to a million people in what China calls 're-education' camps, drawing condemnation from human rights groups and a threat of sanctions from the Trump administration. Collecting genetic material is a key part of China’s campaign, according to human rights groups and Uighur activists. They say a comprehensive DNA database could be used to chase down any Uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign. ...

“China’s campaign poses a direct challenge to the scientific community and the way it makes cutting-edge knowledge publicly available. The campaign relies in part on public DNA databases and commercial technology, much of it made or managed in the United States. In turn, Chinese scientists have contributed Uighur DNA samples to a global database, potentially violating scientific norms of consent.” Human rights groups are accusing the Chinese government of reportedly collecting other DNA samples through free medical checkups, a claim the government denies.

-- In advance of another round of trade talks with China, Trump tweeted that he wanted “5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible.” Brian Fung explains whether 6G is even a thing: “If you have to ask, you are not alone: Searches for ‘6G’ spiked on Google in the moments after Trump’s tweet. The short answer is, 6G is likely what we’ll call whatever advanced data networks come after 5G. And 5G is what carriers are currently building as the next generation after 4G LTE. But so far, 6G exists largely as a theoretical concept and is a long way from being deployed in the real world.”

-- Mitch McConnell has pressed Trump to nominate Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, as the next U.N. ambassador. Axios’s Jonathan Swan reports: “Like McConnell, Craft is from Kentucky, where she and her husband, billionaire coal CEO Joe Craft, rank among the state's highest-profile Republican donors. She previously served as an alternate delegate in the U.S. delegation to the UN during the George W. Bush administration, specializing on the issue of U.S. engagement in Africa.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders refused to call Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro a dictator. (Andrew Harnik/AP)

MORE ON 2020:

-- Florida Democrats criticized Bernie Sanders over his refusal to call Maduro a dictator. From Politico's Marc Caputo: “Sanders also would not say whether he considered [opposition leader Guaidó] ... the nation’s interim president, which is the position of the United States and a majority of Latin American [and] European countries. ... 'He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,' [said] Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles ... Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Vice President Joe Biden, however, have clearly stated they consider Maduro a dictator and Guaidó the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And [Elizabeth Warren] said that she believed Maduro was a dictator.""

-- Warren demanded to know how U.S.-made weapons were reportedly transferred from American allies to al-Qaeda-linked fighters, Iranian-backed rebels and hard-line Salafi militias on the ground in Yemen. Warren, a member of the Armed Services Committee, made the request in a letter to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, CNN's Eliza Mackintosh reports.

-- Bigger picture: The winner of the crowded Democratic primary could determine the trajectory of liberalism for years to come, Molly Ball and Philip Elliott write in a cover story for Time magazine: “The party’s very identity is up for grabs, as a vast and historically diverse crop of candidates brings big, new ideas to a demanding, divided base. … Fittingly, it’s women, minorities and younger candidates who have jumped into the race early, while many white male hopefuls remain on the sidelines, gauging the terrain. … As much as they would like to move away from white male dominance, some rank-and-file Democrats worry that doing so would hurt the party’s chances against Trump. They fear that a woman or nonwhite candidate would be damaged by Trump’s sexism and race-baiting. And to the party faithful, winning is everything.”

-- Barack Obama’s political group, Organizing for Action (OFA), is merging with the National Redistricting Action Fund, a group aimed at giving Democrats an edge in the redistricting process run by former attorney general Eric Holder. The Hill’s Reid Wilson reports: The merger will give the newly created group “control of the vaunted list of supporters, donors and volunteers that Obama and his team built over more than a decade. … While the merger represents a transfer of one of the most valuable commodities in American politics, Holder said he would be legally precluded from using it for his own political purposes. Holder is still considering a run for president, a decision he said he would make in short order, and he said the merger is not an indication that he is leaning one way or the other.”

-- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), another potential presidential candidate, has turned against Amazon since the company reversed its decision to open a second headquarters in Queens, taking an offensive posture that could aid his potential presidential bid. The New York Times’s William Neuman and J. David Goodman report: “Taking a highly visible stand against a big corporation and its phenomenally wealthy chief executive, Jeff Bezos, could score points with the energized Democratic activists on the left who are likely to vote in primaries. It gives him a platform to discuss corporate behavior and income inequality, one of his core progressive issues. It provides an avenue for Mr. de Blasio to position himself on the campaign trail as a mayor who stood up to Amazon — even if he once stood alongside them.” Bezos owns The Post.

-- As they head into 2020, Democrats are seeking to recruit congressional candidates with fresh faces, interesting backgrounds — and short legislative records. From Paul Kane: “In the 2018 midterms, House Democrats had a smashing success with dozens of first-time candidates coming from the military, intelligence agencies and prosecutors’ offices. … Democrats, in reviewing recent elections, privately contend that authenticity is the most important trait for victory, pointing to three incumbents who won in what should have been very tough races last year: Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Jon Tester (Mont.). When it comes to flipping seats, however, Democrats have largely done so with relative newcomers.”

-- All 2020 candidates except for Trump promised they will not use stolen data in the campaign. From the Daily Beast’s Sam Stein, Jackie Kucinich and Scott Bixby: “Nearly three years after hacked materials upended the 2016 presidential campaign, every Democratic candidate running for the White House has pledged not to knowingly use such material should they end up being published during the current election cycle. … The Daily Beast asked each presidential campaign either up-and-running or in its exploratory phase whether they would commit to not knowingly using or referencing hacked material that appears online on grounds that it may have been obtained illegally. Each Democratic candidate responded with some form of commitment to not used hacked materials.”

-- Howard Schultz didn’t vote in this month’s Seattle school levies, a no-show vote that is in line with the former Starbucks CEO’s pattern of ignoring elections despite urging Americans to become civically involved. From the Seattle Times’s Jim Brunner: “Schultz was asked about that record during an appearance in Seattle last month … He responded: ‘I travel all over the world. It’s not an excuse, but I have not been as engaged locally.’ Asked Wednesday why he didn’t vote on the latest school levies, even after facing scrutiny on the issue, Schultz, who was traveling in California, issued a brief statement through a spokeswoman. ‘It would have been great to vote in every election, and I commend all of the Seattleites who have a 100% voting record. I didn’t vote in every local election, but I am proud of Sheri’s and my civic record in this community,’ the statement said, referring to his wife.”

-- The New Jersey Senate approved a bill to keep Trump off the 2020 ballot unless he releases his tax returns. This is the second time Democrats in the state's Senate have tried to pass the controversial measure to block candidates from appearing on the ballot unless they make their returns public. The last time, then-Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed it. (NorthJersey.com)

GOOD READS:

-- Yahoo News, “The Soviets wanted to infiltrate the Reagan camp. So, the CIA recruited a businessman to bait them,” by Zach Dorfman: “Beginning in 1975, a big black limousine with diplomatic plates would pull up once a month to the no-parking zone outside John Greenagel’s office in the handsome Merchants Exchange Building in downtown San Francisco. A man would exit the car, paper bag in hand, and ascend the stairs to Greenagel’s public relations firm. The man would hand Greenagel, then in his mid-30s, the paper bag, which always contained stale Cuban cigars and a bottle of Stolichnaya without a tax stamp. 'Compliments of Mr. Pavlov,' the man would say, and walk out. Yuri Pavlov was a diplomat based at the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco and an undercover KGB officer ... after the Soviet bag man left, Greenagel would call his CIA handler, who would pop over to his office; and they’d laugh and drink the Stoly, smoke the old Cubans and talk about Greenagel’s deepening friendship with Pavlov, which was entirely manufactured. ... Greenagel was acting as an 'access agent' — providing the CIA with key insights about Pavlov’s psychological and personality profile.”

-- Vanity Fair, “‘She Never Looks Back’: Inside Elizabeth Holmes’s Chilling Final Months at Theranos,” by Nick Bilton: “Since Theranos’s collapse, observers have wondered how Holmes kept the company going for so long—how she was able to convince those scientists, investors, and colleagues that her quixotic idea for a portable, revolutionary blood-testing technology could somehow come to fruition. Recently, I posed a similar question to a former Theranos board member: how did the board of directors, composed of such accomplished people, not stop her.”

-- New York Times, “The Rise of the WeWorking Class,” by Gideon Lewis-Kraus: “Most of us have serious reasons to worry about the future of work, and it’s easy to object to WeWork’s thin consolations on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle. Once you get accustomed to the basic product, however, it’s hard not to find it ... pretty nice. Over the course of about a year, I stopped into locations in six or seven cities, and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computers and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly less unmoored.”

-- “‘Something told me to check the vehicle one more time’: How a state trooper saved an infant trapped underwater,” by Allison Klein: “It was the middle of the shift for Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Cody Enloe when he got a call for a car accident on Highway 259, deep in the rural part of the state. A pickup truck had flipped over, and the driver and her children were trapped inside. … Emergency responders and bystanders breathed a sigh of relief once the two children were out, Enloe said, and some started to walk away from the scene. ‘I kind of reverted back to my training, and something told me to check the vehicle one more time,’ Enloe said. ‘I crawled back into the truck.’ Using his flashlight, he saw another car seat, a third one — but this one was partially submerged, and he realized the baby’s face was underwater. There was no sound.”

HOT ON THE LEFT: “Facebook decided which users are interested in Nazis — and let advertisers target them directly,” from the LA Times: “Facebook makes money by charging advertisers to reach just the right audience for their message — even when that audience is made up of people interested in the perpetrators of the Holocaust or explicitly neo-Nazi music. Despite promises of greater oversight following past advertising scandals, a Times review shows that Facebook has continued to allow advertisers to target hundreds of thousands of users the social media firm believes are curious about topics such as ‘Joseph Goebbels,’ ‘Josef Mengele,’ ‘Heinrich Himmler,’ the neo-nazi punk band Skrewdriver and Benito Mussolini’s long-defunct National Fascist Party. Experts say that this practice runs counter to the company’s stated principles and can help fuel radicalization online. … Facebook said that it would remove many of the audience groupings from its ad platform.” HOT ON THE RIGHT: “After a high school is forced to end its ‘Big Booty’ and ‘Big Boobie’ awards, ACLU demands reform,” from Deanna Paul : “When Tremper High School holds its annual cheerleading banquet next month, awards such as ‘most improved’ and ‘hardest worker’ seem likely to reappear. Other accolades from years past face a less-certain future. The 2018 ‘Big Boobie’ award, for example, was given to the cheerleader who accomplished ‘a feat’ by maneuvering ‘through cheer routines with her enormous boobs,’ according to a video provided to the American Civil Liberties Union, which became involved in the matter after concerned parents and a former employee of the Kenosha, Wis., high school contacted it. … The ACLU accused the district of enabling sexual harassment in its school system in violation of federal nondiscrimination and equal protection laws, and threatened to sue if officials fail to take immediate action.”

Here's what you need to know.,"The crisis in Venezuela escalated even further over the weekend, as members of the opposition clashed with soldiers, police and government loyalists at the country’s borders with Colombia and Brazil. As the nation’s humanitarian, economic and political crises worsen, here are some answers to questions you may have while tracking events.

Why are two men claiming to be president of Venezuela?

Nicolás Maduro came to power in March 2013 after the death of former leader Hugo Chávez. Although Maduro pledged to carry on Chávez’s popular socialist policies, Venezuela soon entered into a recession, and his popularity tanked.

In response, Maduro began to consolidate power. He arrested and intimidated rivals, took power away from the opposition-controlled National Assembly and established a constituent assembly stacked with allies to rewrite the country’s constitution. In May, Maduro won a new six-year term as president, but the international community largely viewed the election as a sham.

After Maduro’s inauguration in January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself the interim president of Venezuela. Guaidó, a 35-year-old electrical engineer and head of the National Assembly, argues that Maduro’s reelection was fraudulent. Therefore, because of his position, Guaidó says he is the legitimate president under the country’s constitution.

Guaidó has called for free and fair elections when Maduro steps down, and numerous countries now recognize him as Venezuela's rightful leader.

What is President Trump saying?

President Trump has been watching Venezuela since his first week in office. The Washington Post reported at the time that Trump “surprised his national security team by calling for a briefing on the oil-rich country veering toward economic collapse.”

After Guaidó's declaration last month, Trump swiftly backed the opposition leader, recognizing him as the country’s president and pledging “to use the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy.”

Other members of the administration have weighed in forcefully. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Maduro a “sick tyrant” for keeping aid from Venezuelan civilians, and national security adviser John Bolton called Maduro a “dictator” clinging to an “illegitimate claim to power.”

What is Trump actually doing?

Along with his recognition of Guaidó, Trump has hit Venezuela with sanctions targeting its oil exports. He has called on members of the country’s military to defect, warning them about the consequences of remaining loyal to Maduro. “If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out,” he said in Florida earlier this month. “You will lose everything.”

Trump has also said he won’t “rule out a military option,” although some in Congress have already said they oppose U.S. military intervention in Venezuela.

Pompeo has appointed Elliott Abrams as U.S. special representative for Venezuela. Abrams has a controversial foreign policy record in Latin America. My colleague Ishaan Tharoor writes that “as a prominent State Department official in the Reagan administration, Abrams led the American coverup of a hideous massacre in the Salvadoran village of El Mozote.”

What are other countries saying about the crisis?

More than 60 countries have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president. They include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Israel and the majority of Western Europe. They are all calling for an end to the chaos and trying to provide support for Venezuelans in the form of humanitarian aid.

Who still supports Maduro?

Dozens of countries are also standing behind Maduro, including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Russia. Maduro has said Russian President Vladimir Putin is providing the country with aid and financial assistance.

Russia has a particularly large stake in the survival of Maduro’s regime, not only financially but politically. As my colleague Anton Troianovski writes: “Maduro is a key ally of Russia in Venezuela, giving Moscow a geopolitical foothold a three-hour flight from Miami. Russia has extended billions of dollars in loans to Venezuela and in December dispatched nuclear-capable bombers to the country in a show of force.”

Why is Venzuela’s economic situation so bad?

Because of its massive oil wealth, Venezuela used to be Latin America’s richest country per capita. Under Chávez’s vision for the nation as a socialist paradise, industries were nationalized, and government handouts increased. But after Chávez’s death and a global collapse of oil prices, that vision no longer worked. Cash dried up, and the corruption-ravaged oil industry produced less and less. Runaway inflation set in.

In 2017, The Post’s Anthony Faiola wrote that “Venezuela hasn’t released official inflation data since 2015. But last month, according to the Caracas-based statistical firm Ecoanalítica, the country slipped into hyperinflation — and hit an annualized rate of nearly 2,000 percent.

“The cash-strapped government is now teetering on default, printing reams of bills to keep the economy afloat. That fuels inflation. …

“The nearly worthless bolívar means that imports — which are generally purchased in dollars — are prohibitively expensive and that Venezuelan businesses can’t afford to buy foreign-made inputs, slowing their production.”

As inflation soared, food and medicine became scarce, and basic services broke down. Millions of Venezuelans have now fled the country in search of jobs and sustenance.

What happened this weekend?

Maduro has been blocking most aid from coming into Venezuela, saying that offers by outside groups to bring in assistance are just veiled attempts at foreign invasion.

Nevertheless, the opposition sent thousands of volunteers to the Colombian and Brazilian borders to defy Maduro’s orders and bring in aid supplies. They hoped that the military wouldn’t use force against unarmed civilians carting in humanitarian goods — and that many soldiers might defect.

They were wrong. As The Post reported from the scene, anti-Maduro crowds faced tear gas fired by Venezuelan units on the Colombian border.

“In all, 285 people were injured and 37 hospitalized on the Colombian side of the border, according to Colombia’s foreign minister,” The Post reported. “At least four were killed on the Venezuela-Brazil border after clashing with pro-government militias.”

And although dozens of members of the Venezuelan military switched sides, events showed that Maduro is maintaining the support and strength of his security forces.

What will happen next?

Guaidó is asking for more help. This weekend, he secretly crossed the border into Colombia despite having been banned from leaving Venezuela by the country’s supreme court. Guaidó met with Vice President Pence as well as Latin American leaders in Bogotá on Monday. There, Pence announced new U.S. sanctions against Maduro loyalists, calling on other nations to do the same.

Amid Saturday's clashes, he seemed to hint that he is open to a military intervention. “Today’s events force me to make a decision: to pose to the international community in a formal way that we must have all options open to achieve the liberation of this country that is fighting and will continue to fight,” Guaidó tweeted on Saturday.

On Monday, my colleagues reported that Pence acknowledged Guaidó “sought assurances that the United States could use force if necessary, but the vice president did not set a red line for that decision or hint at what he would recommend to Trump.”

Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, told The Post that “Guaidó’s insistence that ‘all options are on the table’ echoes President Trump’s words, first uttered in August 2017 and widely interpreted as serious consideration of military action.”

But even in the United States, which has taken a strong stance against Maduro, a military intervention has little support. Invading Venezuela could help Maduro “portray himself globally as a leftist martyr persecuted by the Trump administration,” my colleagues write.

And so one day after markets perplexingly closed in the red, US markets are set for a higher open, following similar moves across the world.

Following a mixed session in Asia, European stocks, bonds and FX markets traded near session highs in anticipation of more optimistic headlines from top-level trade talks between America and China, while ignoring the latest disappointing German data, where all February IFO survey components (business confidence, current assessment, expectations) fell from prior month, and missing forecasts while Germany's final Q4 GDP of 0.0% was unrevised from the preliminary print.

Mining and technology shares led the advance in the Europe Stoxx 600 Index as Bloomberg’s industrial-metals subindex headed for its highest level since October, as positive earnings from companies drove big stock swings as European markets opened, with traders now awaiting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s a speech later Friday.

In the final Euro-area CPI data, both core (1.1%) and headline (1.4%) were unrevised from preliminary readings. More notably, ECB's Nowotny said the central bank has no conclusions yet on TLTROs, and expects a decision on targeted loans to come later than March, adding that the Governing Council has until summer to reach a decision. Over in Sweden, central bank head Ingves says risks are now mostly on the downside, noting that if risks were to materialize Riksbank policy would need to be adjusted.

Across the Atlantic, futures on the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes all climbed, even as Buffett darling Kraft Heinz plunged to the lowest on record after announcing a $15.4 billion writedown late Thursday. The S&P is now up 8 of the past 9 weeks

Emerging-market stocks rose for a fifth day, the longest streak since May, and a gauge of smaller Chinese stocks entered a bull market. Japanese shares slipped,

Earlier in Asia, shares were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese shares, with the Shanghai Composite closing 1.9% higher. Chinese shares had faltered earlier amid concern about slowing domestic growth and indications that China would cut its benchmark interest rate only as a last resort to boost the economy. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.2% lower after data showed core consumer inflation accelerated in January but remained far from the central bank’s 2 percent target. Elsewhere, Australian shares gained 0.5 percent and Seoul’s Kospi ended up 0.1 percent.

As Bloomberg summarizes the narrative that has prevailed every day for weeks, markets were cautiously optimistic as U.S. President Donald Trump was set to meet with China’s top trade negotiator in Washington Friday, with the two sides facing a March 1 deadline to avoid a further escalation in tariffs. Optimism for an accord between the world’s economic superpowers combined with a less-hawkish stance from some of the biggest central banks has sent an MSCI global gauge of stocks surging 15% in less than two months. Still, concerns about global growth persist.

“Central banks will take center stage in March, and we believe their appetite to continue with tighter monetary policy will be scaled back,” Nedbank Group Ltd. strategists Mehul Daya and Walter de Wet said in a note. “Once again the global economy and especially financial markets cannot endure tighter monetary policy and would have to rely on policy makers to stimulate economic growth. These are symptoms of a fragile global economy and financial system.”

Still, it's all about trade, as trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks. Trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators continued in Washington, with little more than a week left before a U.S.-imposed deadline expires, triggering higher tariffs. Reuters reported on Wednesday the two sides were drafting language for six memoranda of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms, progress that had helped to lift investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said. “Given that enough headway seems to have been made to warrant a meeting between Trump and the Chinese negotiator today, it appears more likely that the U.S. will not raise the levies, which should help high-beta currencies and equities push higher,” said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.

In FX, the Australian dollar recovered after falling more than 1% on Thursday, when Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China’s foreign ministry said on Friday coal imports continued but customs had stepped up inspections environment and safety checks on foreign cargoes. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe cautioned against seeing restrictions as being directed at Australia, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban does not indicate a souring relationship between the countries. Separate comments by Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. It was last up 0.35 percent at $0.71120.

Elsewhere, the dollar gained for a third day as traders awaited the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and a series of speeches from Fed policy makers; the euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1346, nearing a two-week high. German business morale fell for a sixth time in a row, to its lowest in over four years, a survey showed. European Central Bank policymakers asked for swift preparations to give banks more long-term loans, minutes of its last meeting showed on Thursday.

New Zealand’s dollar weakened against all its major peers after the central bank said proposals to increase lenders’ capital requirements could eventually lead to an interest-rate cut. Sweden’s krona advanced versus all Group-of-10 peers after minutes of the Riksbank’s February meeting showed that “some board members discussed the recent depreciation of the krona and Deputy Governor Martin Floden even suggested that a weaker currency could play a part in him advocating for another rate increase already in two months

In rates, Italian government bond yields crept up on Friday, reflecting caution among investors before a Fitch ratings review. US Treasurys were generally unchanged, with the 10Y TSY trading at 2.68%.

The dollar and gold were flat, while West Texas oil traded rose above $57 a barrel in New York. Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices were firmer after a lacklustre overnight session, ahead of US President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Goldman Sachs revised their 2019 US oil supply growth expectations to 1.4mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Looking ahead, we have the Baker Hughes rig count which last week saw oil rigs increase by 3 to 857, as such the total rig count figure was 1051 from the prior 1049. Gold (U/C) has been largely unchanged taking the lead from an uneventful dollar ahead of multiple key Fed speakers today, including Federal Reserve Vice Chair Clarida.

No major economic data are expected today, while several Fed representatives are due to speak. Cabot Oil, Magna International and Royal Bank of Canada are among companies reporting earnings

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were mixed with the Australian benchmark resilient as participants took a breather from the recent deluge of earnings and as financials remained afloat, but with upside capped by weakness in Energy following similar underperformance by the sector stateside and with Woodside Petroleum shares down by over 4% as it traded ex-dividend.

Swedbank CEO Still Has Board’s Support Amid Laundering Shock

In FX, AUD,NZD,SEK More volatile trade down under, as the Aussie receives a welcome reprieve from China that has now categorically refuted reports that it blocked coal imports having initially claimed no knowledge rather than issuing a firm denial. However, Aud/Usd still seems top heavy amidst recent more dovish RBA calls, even though the Kiwi has been rattled by similar RBNZ impulses, and from the horse’s mouth as it were given comments from Bascand overnight about proposed rises in bank capital requirements heightening easing prospects, in time. Aud/Nzd has rebounded further from sub-1.0400 lows in response, as Nzd/Usd reversed through 0.6800 to circa 0.6760 at one stage. Conversely, Eur/Sek is around 10.6000 in wake of Riksbank minutes and accompanying statements from Governor Ingves in the main, playing down weaker than forecast Swedish inflation in January and keeping guidance for H2 tightening in place, albeit conditional on economic developments and unless downside risks (largely due to external factors) do not materialise.

EUR,GBP The single currency and Sterling remain relatively rangebound on the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles vs the Dollar respectively, but both currencies are getting indirect support from the Greenback’s failure to muster/sustain any positive momentum of its own. Eur/Usd continues to hit resistance above 1.1350 and a downbeat German Ifo survey has not helped, while Brexit is a constant weight for the Pound along with related fall-out on the domestic political front. From a tech perspective, 1.3000 is obvious support, especially as the 200 DMA is just 2 pips below, while for Eur/Usd a decent 1.6 bn expiry at the 1.1300 strike may underpin vs a 1.1362 Fib and the 30 DMA in close proximity at 1.1369.

CAD, JPY Not much action in the Loonie or the Japanese currency, though the former is marginally benefiting from gains in the oil complex, mostly driven by market sentiment. Similarly, risk appetite has marginally weakened the JPY, with USD/JPY currently residing just below the top of the 110.65-90 intraday range. Back to the CAD, retail sales may spur some action in the Loonie with the headline expected at -0.3%, up from the prior -0.9%.

In commodities, Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices are firmer after a lacklustre overnight session, ahead of US President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at 19:30GMT. Of note Goldman Sachs have revised their 2019 US oil supply growth expectations to 1.4mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Looking ahead, we have the Baker Hughes rig count which last week saw oil rigs increase by 3 to 857, as such the total rig count figure was 1051 from the prior 1049. Gold (U/C) has been largely unchanged taking the lead from an uneventful dollar ahead of multiple key Fed speakers today, including Federal Reserve Vice Chair Clarida at 17:00 GMT. Elsewhere, recent newsflow has seen China’s foreign ministry denying reports that some ports in China have halted Australian coal imports; stating that Chinese customs are quality and environmental checks surrounding coal. Barrick Gold is reportedly considering a hostile bid for Newmont Mining Corp, at around USD 19bln in stock; which has the possibility of being one of the largest mining-deals ever

Looking at the day ahead, there’s no data due in the US, however it is a busy day for Fedspeak with Bostic, Williams, Daly, Clarida, Potter, Bullard, Harker and Quarles are scheduled to speak. The ECB’s Draghi is also due to speak at a ceremonial event this afternoon.

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

I got home from Frankfurt yesterday to find windows open and duvets abandoned. Summer has temporarily arrived. However we forgot to close the window after dark and it was freezing going to bed. As could have easily been predicted, my eyes and nose have started to react horribly to the change in weather. Hay Fever is showing its ugly head again with a vengeance. One of the rare side effects of taking too many of my prescribed anti-histamines is apparently hair growing in usual places. For me that would mean my head. So if the corporate picture of me on this email looks different on Monday you’ll know what’s happened. Before the heatwave continues here in Europe over the weekend, a reminder that you can download our new podcast series “Podzept” on sites like Spotify. More details on this page http://www.dbresearch.com/podzept . This series includes one from me on what the history of populism can teach us.

Before you plug in your headphones for the weekend, markets have lost a bit of momentum over the last 24 hours. Indeed equity markets traded lower yesterday as a slew of mostly negative economic data, some signs of more intense trade disruptions, and a slight hawkish lean from the ECB combined to weigh on sentiment. The S&P 500, DOW, and NASDAQ fell -0.34%, -0.40%, and -0.39%, respectively, and the moves had a distinctly defensive tinge to them, with S&P 500 utilities and consumer staples (+0.75% and +0.28%) rising. In Europe, the STOXX 600 retreated -0.28% and Sweden’s OMX Stockholm 30 index underperformed sharply after Swedish regulators opened a money laundering investigation of its banking system. Swedbank (-9.34%), Nordea (-4.49%), and SEB (-4.04%) led declines.

Despite the mild selloff in equities, safe havens failed to rally much either. Treasury yields rose +4.1bps and bunds were up +2.7bps. Gold fell -1.15% and the dollar was close to flat. In fact, some of the only assets to rally yesterday were peripheral European spreads, which tightened -5.4bps, -3.5bps, and -2.5bps in Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

Data didn’t help yesterday with the big story being the flash February PMIs in Europe. To be honest we’ve had easier PMIs to summarise. In a nutshell a big jump in the services data more than offset a worrying decline in the manufacturing sector. The dilemma for markets is that modern economies are far more serviced based but asset prices tend to be correlated more to the manufacturing cycle - something that rung true yesterday.

In aggregate the Euro Area composite nudged up a bit more than expected, by +0.4pts to 51.4 (vs. consensus forecast for 51.1). The services reading jumped +1.1pts to 52.3 (vs. 51.3) however the flip side was the manufacturing print sliding below 50 and to the lowest in 68 months at 49.2 (vs. 50.3 expected and 50.5 previously). The data throws open the question of which way the gap may be closed – up to the services reading or down to the manufacturing reading?

Yesterday’s divergence was most stark in Germany. The services reading jumped +2.1pts to 55.1 (vs. 52.9) and the highest in five months while the manufacturing fell -2.1pts to 47.6 (vs. 49.8 expected) and the lowest in 74 months. The gap of 7.5pts between the two is the biggest since 2009. Like the broader Euro Area reading, the surprising increase in the services component did help the composite lift to 52.7 from 52.1. As our economists put it however, the overall data in Germany did little to provide any evidence of a normalization let alone a rebound. Indeed they note that on the contrary, the weak development in the industrial component points to negative GDP growth in Q1.

On the trade front, news was mixed, as Secretary of State Pompeo said in an interview that “real progress” is being made by negotiators. A subsequent report by Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail said that the two sides are making “the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war.” That progress reportedly includes an offer from China to increase its imports of US agriculture products by $30 billion, which would be substantive but insufficient since the US is pushing for more commitments on intellectual property and other non-trade issues. Overnight, Bloomberg has reported that the US President Trump plans to meet China’s Vice Premier Liu He today afternoon (US time) while, the FT reported that the US and China negotiators are attempting to resolve disputes involving semiconductor companies – Micron and Fujian Jinhua - as part of the larger trade agreement as solid agreements on long-running commercial disputes may help the US sell a broader trade deal. The FT report further added that other measures being discussed include easing China’s restrictions on US polysilicone imports and final approval by the PBOC for Visa and MasterCard to provide domestic payment services in China.

Despite the more positive headlines on trade overnight, Asian markets are largely heading lower following Wall Street’s lead with the exception of China – the Shanghai Comp (+0.19%) is up while the Nikkei (-0.28%), Hang Seng (-0.34%) and Kospi (-0.26%) are all down. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 (-0.07%) are trading flattish.

Somewhat related to trade, Reuters reported yesterday that China has blocked all coal imports from Australia at its Dalian port. While not a major destination for Australian coal (around 2% of exports), it may indicate that China is coercively flexing its trade power, and the Australian dollar weakened -1.05% (trading flat this morning). Separately, Maersk, the world’s largest shipping firm, announced a very low profit forecast for 2019 of $4bn, versus consensus estimates for $4.77bn. The CEO cited trade disruptions and macro slowdown as key factors, and the company’s shares slide -10.12% in Copenhagen.

To wrap up the PMIs, the data in France was a bit less exciting but all the same we did see the composite nudge up to 49.9 from 48.9, boosted also by an increase in the services reading of +2pts to 49.8 (vs. 48.5 expected), as the effect of the ‘Yellow Vest’ protests fades. The manufacturing reading rose +0.2pts to 51.4 (vs. 51.0 expected). So some big divergence across countries and sectors in the Europe PMIs which is only going to make it harder to build an ECB consensus. Next month’s meeting should be an interesting watch.

The PMIs weren’t the only developments in Europe yesterday with the ECB minutes and comments from Rehn and Nowotny also garnering attention. On the former, the minutes highlighted that “technical analyses” is required to prepare policy options for future liquidity operations and that this is needed to “proceed swiftly”. That reinforces the clearly converging sense of urgency amongst governing council members and is clearly no longer the big secret that it once was. The minutes also flagged that policy makers will assess the growth outlook “in more depth” in March when new forecasts are available.

As for Rehn’s comments, given his position as a contender to succeed Draghi later this year, it was notable to hear his use of the famous phrase “whatever it takes” which would clearly signal some form of policy continuity. Meanwhile Nowotny was at the margin a bit hawkish, saying specifically that “I personally can’t identify a need for additional liquidity”. DB’s Mark Wall did make the important point however that “no further liquidity” could just be consistent with a TLTRO2 solution that allows existing net exposures to be rolled over. Indeed, that policy option was explicitly referenced in a later MNI report, citing eurosystem sources, that policymakers are considering an extension of existing TLTROs for up to two years, with less generous terms than prior facilities. Overall, that would be toward the less-accommodative end of the spectrum of policy options.

Over on the other side of the Atlantic, the US chose not to be outdone on the data front. Of particular note was the plunge in the Philly Fed survey in February by 21.1pts to -4.1 (vs. +14.0 expected). That was the largest single month drop since August 2011 and notably new orders were also very soft (-2.4 vs. +21.3 previously). The good news was that the six-month ahead component was a lot more positive which perhaps lends an argument to the government shutdown impact. In better news, the latest jobless claims reading declined 23k to 216k. That followed three straight weeks of >235k prints so we were running out of time to blame the shutdown. As for the December orders data, ex transportation (+0.1% mom vs. +0.3% expected) and core capex orders (-0.7% mom vs. +0.2% expected) both missed which is significant for Q4 GDP, while the flash February PMIs also diverged (as with elsewhere around the world) with services +2pts to 56.2 and manufacturing -1.2pts to 53.7. Finally the January leading index (-0.1% mom vs. +0.1% expected) and existing home sales (-1.2% mom vs. +0.2% expected) data both missed.

Over to Brexit and the UK Parliament vote was confirmed for the 27th. In all likelihood the newsflow suggests that the vote won’t be on a new withdrawal agreement according to DB’s Oli Harvey and so therefore remains to be seen what May can offer MPs to stave off a Boles/Cooper revolt which would force the government to extend Article 50 (though the amendment is now technically called Letwin-Cooper). So a delicate few days of negotiation ahead at home and in Brussels but it seems any concession from the latter isn’t going to come ahead of next week so for May’s strategy to work she seemingly needs to take Parliament with her well into March. Challenging!! Moreover, Bloomberg has reported that the EU sees PM May asking for a three-month extension to Brexit assuming that a deal is reached in March to give the UK parliament enough time to pass necessary legislation related to its departure from the EU while adding that both sides are keen to avoid an extension of longer than three months as it would put the UK under pressure to take part in European elections on May 23-26. Elsewhere, the Telegraph reported yesterday that a group of 100 conservative lawmakers have signed a letter addressed to Julian Smith, the chief whip of the party, indicating that they’d vote against May to force her to delay Brexit and take no deal off the table in case she is not able to reach a deal and have called for a free vote next week on a backbench bid to take no deal off the table. In part this gives more legs to the Letwin/Cooper amendment. Sterling finished -0.11% weaker yesterday.

In other news, CNN reported that the US Justice Department is preparing to announce as soon as next week the completion of Mueller’s Russia investigation. On this, Bloomberg reported yesterday that Democrats were seeking to potentially subpoena Mueller if the results aren’t publically released. Expect this to be a big topic next week.

Finally to the day ahead where this morning we get the final Q4 GDP revisions in Germany. A reminder that the preliminary reading came in at +0.02% qoq and therefore implied that Germany had avoided a recession by the thinnest of margins. As we stated last week it was a margin roughly equivalent to the EuroMillions winner’s cheque from last week. So even the smallest of downward revisions could see Germany tip into a technical recession with Q1 also not looking great so far (see earlier). Also due out will be the February IFO survey in Germany before we get the final January CPI revisions for the Euro Area and February CBI survey in the UK. There’s no data due in the US, however it is a busy day for Fedspeak with Bostic, Williams, Daly, Clarida, Potter, Bullard, Harker and Quarles are scheduled to speak. The ECB’s Draghi is also due to speak at a ceremonial event this afternoon.","""Sea Of Green"" Across World Markets As Trade Talk Optimism Storms Back",Zerohedge.com,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-22/sea-green-across-world-markets-trade-talk-optimism-storms-back

The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race.

The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh’s ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he’s not taking anything for granted but he’s confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

“I think people are very disappointed with what’s going on with the Liberal government,” he said.

“Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.”

WATCH: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh makes statement on SNC Lavalin controversy

Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make.

Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep.

“I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,” he said.

Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor.

“(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” he said. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.”

Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can’t win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn’t secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston.

The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South.

“That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,” he said.

Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa.

He has touted the Liberal government’s national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money.

Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit.

Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier’s new right-wing People’s Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives.

A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration.

An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous.

When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen, in which a Syrian national has been charged, to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: “That is racist! Shame on you!”

However, Shin said he isn’t worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn’t think her message is resonating.

“`When I speak with voters at the doors, I don’t get a sense of that at all,” he said.

Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People’s Party.

BURNABY, B.C. -- The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a ""gift"" to his campaign.

MONTREAL -- Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, says people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality -- and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in front of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about (the turban),"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Kathryn Furlong, 43, who attended the debate, said she voted for Sanchez, an economist with experience in humanitarian work and climate activism, at an advance poll. She has voted Liberal in the past ""but never by conviction. Sometimes to keep the out the Conservatives.""

She said ""it's a sad notion and a sad question,"" referring to anyone who would have an issue with the NDP leader's expression of faith. ""And I think political parties in Quebec try to exploit that issue.""

Outremont has been represented by the NDP since former party leader Tom Mulcair won a 2007 federal byelection in what had long been a Liberal stronghold. Through the rise and fall of NDP popularity in Quebec, voters elected Mulcair another three times.

Mulcair stepped down last August and is now a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal and a political commentator. The NDP is currently polling fourth in Quebec, far from its highs when Jack Layton helped the party win the majority of the province's seats in 2011.

McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, a longtime NDP supporter who campaigned with Sanchez ahead of the byelection, said the cool reception Singh has so far received in Quebec is due to the fact he doesn't yet have a seat in Parliament. Singh is his party's candidate in one of the other two byelections Monday, in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Once he gets inside the House of Commons and is regularly in front of the cameras, Taylor predicted, ""Quebecers will learn to like him. He's very engaging, but he's just not on television all the time.""

The Coalition Avenir Quebec won last fall's provincial election with a promise to prohibit some public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. But Taylor said Singh is ""going to make a case for: 'You can wear this kind of thing and be a perfectly reasonable person.' And that's something that Quebecers are able to listen to.""

While an NDP loss Monday would further hurt the party in the province, Justin Trudeau's Liberals arguably have more at stake.

The party has 39 seats in Quebec leading into Monday's vote and 179 nationally. Polling indicates Liberal support has declined across the country since the 2015 vote, and Trudeau is looking to pick up seats in Quebec to maintain his party's majority in next fall's general election.

Outremont -- where 36 per cent of residents are immigrants and 66 per cent are bilingual -- is the kind of riding the Liberals must connect with in order to maintain their success in Quebec.

Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former political aide, finished second to Mulcair in 2015. Her party has consistently led polls in the province since the last election. But in recent weeks it has been embroiled in controversy over allegations that the Prime Minister's Office improperly pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help engineering giant SNC-Lavalin escape criminal prosecution.

The Montreal-based company is charged with bribery and fraud over its dealings in Libya, and it has said a conviction could lead to job losses and make it vulnerable to foreign takeover.

Bendayan said it is journalists, not the people she meets when knocking on doors in the riding, who are asking about SNC-Lavalin. ""No, people are not raising it,"" she said in a recent interview recently at her campaign office. ""People here are concerned with issues that affect their day-to-day lives. You'd be surprised how many people talk to me about the ice on the sidewalks.""

Tom Boushel, 72, a Liberal volunteer who will be driving seniors to vote on Monday, said he doesn't think the SNC-Lavalin issue will have as much of an impact in Quebec as elsewhere. ""Quebecers are sensitive to the risk of job losses,"" Boushel said, adding that Montrealers appreciate the prestige of having a global firm headquartered in their city.

Boushel said ""every elected official of every party ... every government has to fight to keep SNC going. I think in Quebec, I think they understand a little better.""

The byelection is the first test for the Bloc Quebecois under its new leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, who was acclaimed in January. The Bloc is hoping its candidate, author Michel Duchesne, will help the party become competitive once again in the riding.

A jury has found a Montreal man guilty of manslaughter in the killing of his ailing wife.

Michel Cadotte was on trial for second-degree murder in the suffocation death of Jocelyne Lizotte, who was in the last stages of Alzheimer's disease.

The Crown had argued that Cadotte had intended to kill his wife of 19 years, who was unable to care for herself.

Defence lawyers argued their client was in a disturbed state of mind and acted impulsively on Feb. 20, 2017, seeking to end his wife's suffering.

Jurors had only two verdicts open to them: second-degree murder or manslaughter.

The crime had been framed in the media as a compassion killing — an offence that doesn't exist in the Criminal Code. The trial, which began Jan. 14, heard that Cadotte had inquired about a medically assisted death for Lizotte a year before she was killed.

Justice Helene Di Salvo told jurors their deliberations would not consider the laws around medically assisted death or the quality of care provided in long-term care centres like the one in which Lizotte lived, even if those issues inevitably surfaced in the case.

""Your functions are limited to whether the prosecution proved the culpability of Mr. Cadotte beyond a reasonable doubt on either second-degree murder or manslaughter,"" Di Salvo said.

Cadotte's lawyers had argued, without the jury present, that an acquittal should be possible, but the judge ruled it wasn't an option.

The accused had admitted to killing Lizotte and the legal criteria had not been met for acquittal, Di Salvo ruled. In her final instructions, she told the jurors they should not take into account the potential sentence, because sentencing is the judge's responsibility.

Second-degree murder carries a life sentence without possibility of parole for at least 10 years while there is no minimum sentence for a manslaughter conviction, unless a firearm was used in the crime.

The Crown had argued Cadotte was in full control and intended to take Lizotte's life.

A physician from the Emilie-Gamelin long-term care facility testified that although Lizotte had late-stage Alzheimer's and was detached from reality, she was not deemed to be at the end of her life. She was receiving care to keep her comfortable but wasn't at a point where palliative care was necessary.

Cadotte had spent years caring for his wife, even after her she was placed in care. He did her laundry because Lizotte's immune system was weak, and he didn't want her clothes washed with other patients'. He had a hairdresser visit every month and had a television installed in her room so she could listen to music. He also made sure she had better quality lotions, soaps and shampoos. He gave her chocolate — her one luxury — whenever he could.

The court heard Lizotte's family was largely unable to cope with her illness and Cadotte was left to handle her care.

Cadotte testified that he felt tremendous guilt when he decided in March 2013 that he could no longer care for Lizotte at home, because she had often told him she didn't want to end up in care like her own mother — who'd also suffered from Alzheimer's.

He testified that other relatives had distanced themselves, but he couldn't follow suit.

""She was my wife. I loved her,"" Cadotte told the court. ""I wasn't able to (leave her).""",Guilty in ailing wife's death - Canada News - Castanet.net,Castanet.net,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/249975/Guilty-in-ailing-wife-s-death

Mourners will descend upon a large Halifax hall today for the funeral of seven children who died in a fast-moving house fire.

The service for the Barho children will begin at 1:30 p.m. at the Cunard Centre on the city's waterfront.

Imam Abdallah Yousri says funeral proceedings will follow in the Islamic traditions, but is open to people of all faiths and members of the public.

He says he hopes that by opening the ceremony up to all who wish to attend, the children's mother — Syrian refugee Kawthar Barho — will see the widespread support and sympathy from the community.

Yousri says the traditional portion of the service will be followed by words from community members, including Halifax MP Andy Fillmore, who is trying to help some of the mother's overseas relatives come to Canada.

Following the funeral service, there will be a burial at a Muslim cemetery in Hammonds Plains.

""(Kawthar Barho) doesn't have family over here in Canada. She does not have friends as well here in Halifax because she moved here five months ago,"" said Yousri on Friday.

""That's why we are trying to invite her to come see the support and let everybody gather.""

Shuttles will be organized to and from the Cunard Centre to accommodate those who wish to attend, and ample parking is available at the centre.

The children's father — Ebraheim Barho — remained in hospital Friday recovering from extensive burns. He was in critical, but stable condition.

Early Tuesday, the Quartz Drive house fire killed all of the Barho children: Ahmad, 14; Rola, 12; Mohamad, 9; Ola, 8; Hala, 3; Rana, 2 and Abdullah, who was born in Canada on Nov. 9.

The cause of the fire remains unclear.

The scale of the tragedy for the young family who arrived in Nova Scotia in September 2017 as refugees has struck a chord with Canadians.

A GoFundMe campaign had raised more than $523,846 by late Friday afternoon, with a $1-million goal.

The Barho family lived in Elmsdale, a 30-minute drive north of Halifax, when they first arrived in Nova Scotia and were embraced by residents there.

They had moved to the Halifax suburb of Spryfield to take advantage of language training and other immigrant services, and had planned to return to Elmsdale next month.

The family was among 1,795 Syrian refugees who have come to Nova Scotia in recent years. The Trudeau government granted asylum to 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2015-16.

UPDATE: 5:20 p.m.

Two new cases of measles were reported in British Columbia on Sunday, as officials in Alberta and the Northwest Territories warned that someone may have exposed others to the infection as they travelled.

A spokesman with the Vancouver International Airport said the first case arrived on a Philippine Airlines flight from Manila on Feb. 11, and another person with measles departed Vancouver on an Air Canada flight to Edmonton the following day.

Chris Devauld did not know whether the passenger on the Philippine Airlines flight left Vancouver on another flight or stayed, nor did he know whether the Edmonton-bound passenger had arrived in Vancouver from another destination.

""Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia and we have the means to deal with that,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference Sunday where he stressed the need for people to be immunized.

""I don't think, in my view anyway, enough people are immunized in B.C.""

Health officials in both Alberta and the Northwest Territories advised people who aren't vaccinated for measles and who may have been on board flights, in shuttles, at stores or hotels where the affected person was present to monitor themselves for symptoms.

Measles at first presents with flu-like symptoms, but then a fever develops followed by the distinctive rash.

""Measles is an extremely contagious disease, spread easily through the air. There is no treatment for measles; however, it can be prevented through immunization,"" the AHS news release said.

UPDATE: 2:20 p.m.

Two more people in Vancouver have become infected with measles after a contagious person travelled through Vancouver International Airport.

Damien Healy, a spokesman for N.W.T. Health and Social Services, confirms that a person with measles who passed through Vancouver and Edmonton before flying to other destinations in the North is the same person.

There was no immediate word on where the person had been before Vancouver.

Health officials in B.C. have been investigating nearly a dozen measles cases in the Vancouver area.

Many of them have been at two French-language schools in Vancouver, a cluster that began after an unvaccinated B.C. child contracted the disease during a family trip to Vietnam.

Vancouver Coastal Health announced Sunday in a tweet there are two new cases of people who were infected while travelling.

ORIGINAL: 1:50 p.m.

Two new measles cases have been diagnosed in Vancouver, bringing the number to 12 people with measles.

Vancouver Coastal Health announced on Sunday afternoon that the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving the schools.

“The two people got the infection while traveling,” says a spokesperson.

Vancouver International Airport tweeted that if you were at the airport on Feb. 11 or 12 and are experiencing symptoms to please contact 811 and speak with a nurse.

More information about the two cases is expected to be released on Sunday afternoon.

Alberta Health Services announced Sunday that an infected person travelled from Vancouver International Airport, stopped in Edmonton and flew to Inuvik.

Anyone who visited the same locations on the same day may have been exposed to measles.

On Friday, Vancouver Coastal medical health officer Dr. Althea Hayden said nine of the cases were clearly associated with schools that were at the centre of the original outbreak this month, but they don't know where the other person contracted the disease.

A number of specific public venues near Vancouver where people could have been exposed to measles have now been identified and listed here.

Measles at first presents with flu-like symptoms, coughing, a runny nose and red eyes, but then a fever develops, followed by the distinctive rash.

People who think they have measles are advised to stay home and call Health Link at 811 before visiting any health care facility or provider.

In its 700-page report, the energy regulator said the expansion of the crude oil pipeline would be in the public interest by creating a diverse market for Western Canadian oil producers; spurring job creation and economic development for local and Indigenous communities, and enhancing revenues for governments. While the benefits would be largely national and regional in scope, the environmental risks will largely be borne by local communities, including First Nations, the board noted.

The federal government will continue its consultations with First Nations to determine what precise concerns affected communities have about the project, and how their views can be accommodated. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa will aim to conclude its consultations and make a decision by June.

Despite negative impacts, “the NEB recommends that the government of Canada finds that they can be justified in the circumstances in light of the considerable benefits of the projects and measures to mitigate the effects,” the board’s chief environment officer, Robert Steedman, told a Friday news conference in Calgary. The board set out 156 conditions the pipeline proponent – now the federal government – would have to meet, while making 16 recommendations to Ottawa for measures that would limit the impact of increased ship traffic in the Salish Sea and help restore the already-polluted, heavily travelled waterway.

The pipeline expansion plan has provoked inter-provincial feuding, oil-industry rage and fears among activists and some First Nations communities over threats to the environment and marine species. The government of Alberta and the oil industry maintain the Trans Mountain project is a crucial economic lifeline to expand crude exports and relieve the frequent price pressure on Western Canadian crude that results from insufficient pipeline capacity. Environmental activists decried the NEB’s conclusion, saying it is clear the pipeline will cause further damage to the orcas in the Salish Sea and would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the oil industry.

Ottawa’s 2016 approval of the pipeline expansion was quashed last August when a Federal Court of Appeal judge found the government’s First Nations consultations had been inadequate and that the NEB did not properly consider the impacts of increased marine traffic.

However, the project was in trouble even before the court decision. Faced with opposition from the government of British Columbia, Indigenous leaders, and environmental groups, former owner Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd., announced last April that it was halting construction.

In late May, the Liberal government announced it would purchase the existing Trans Mountain pipeline and terminal for $4.5-billion and finance the expansion project until it could eliminate much of the political and legal risk and resell it to the private sector. Some First Nations leaders in Alberta and B.C. have expressed an interest in purchasing a stake in the pipeline project, a notion the Liberal government supports.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the NEB’s revised conditions and additional recommendations were sound, though she cautioned that Friday’s report isn’t the end of the process. Specifically, she acknowledged that the project could still face more court challenges and protests.

“Many obstacles have been put in our way, and quite clearly we are not done yet,” she told reporters in Calgary.

Ms. Notley said that once the federal cabinet makes its decision, which she expects before the federal election, construction would likely resume very quickly. In the meantime, she said she’ll be pressing the federal government to ensure consultations with First Nations are adequate so a new federal approval won’t be derailed by another court challenge.

British Columbia’s Environment Minister, George Heyman, said he was disappointed at the NEB’s ruling. “They found there would be significant impacts on southern resident killer whales, [and] that there would be a catastrophic impact if there was a spill,"" he said. ""And they reached the conclusion, astoundingly, that no new conditions were needed.” He vowed B.C. will continue with legal reference case that will test the constitutional limits of the province’s authority to restrict the flow of oil crossing its borders.

Indigenous leaders opposed to the pipeline project said Friday the board’s report does nothing to allay their concerns about risks to the salmon and killer whales. And they vow to pursue further legal challenges if Ottawa approves it again.

“We have a reciprocal and loving and spiritual relationship with the lands and the water and the things on it like the salmon and the whales,” said Rueben George, of the Tsleil Waututh First Nation, which was part of the legal challenge that quashed the first permit. “We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the things that we love, because no price can be put on the sacred.”

According to Thompson, the populist party has mobilized the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote.","BURNABY—When Ivan Pak went to Maxime Bernier’s first rally in Vancouver last November, he says he was “inspired” by the new party leader’s clear platform and policy commitments. That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People’s Party of Canada, meets supporters on Thursday at an event prior to Monday’s federal byelection in Burnaby, B.C. ( Jesse Winter / Star Metro )

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Nathaniel Allen, who supports the People's Party of Canada, drove from Mission, B.C., to attend a campaign event in Burnaby on Thursday. Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South. Byelections will also be held that day in York—Simcoe, Ont. and in Outremont, Que. David Moscrop, author of the new book Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster. But behind the privacy of the voting screen? Many may mark an X for that candidate.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy.

107,Empty,2019-02-22T09:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts was rarely quoted in news articles,speaking to journalists only on background. But he was particularly outspoken on one public forum: Twitter.","Key aides to a prime minister generally prefer to stay in the shadows, perhaps providing background information to Parliament Hill journalists, but rarely giving interviews or generating much of a public persona.

In some ways, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts carried on that tradition, rarely quoted, speaking to journalists only on background.

But he was particularly outspoken on the social media site Twitter.

Butts, who resigned Monday in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, garnered a reputation of being a prolific tweeter, never shy to express his opinions, or ""personal views"" as he referred to them.

He would promote and champion the Liberal Party and the prime minister's policy initiatives. But he would also defend the prime minister, sometimes lash out at critics, take partisan swipes at the Conservatives and engage in Twitter spats with politicians and journalists.

Even before Trudeau became prime minister in 2015, Butts was a presence on Twitter. In that year's election campaign, Butts went after one of his favourite targets, news media company Postmedia, over their articles about Trudeau's insistence that all new Liberal candidates must be pro-choice on abortion.

Read <a href=""https://twitter.com/cselley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@cselley</a> mock The Star, then guess how many breathless op-eds his paper published on Trudeau's pro-choice policy. —@gmbutts

And just before the election.

Postmedia has done to Canadian journalism what Harper's party has done to Canadian politics. Discuss. —@gmbutts

But after Trudeau became prime minister, Butts's criticism about the media company continued: Sometimes in a more cheeky manner:

Your country is red.<br>Postmedia is blue.<br>They can't figure out what happened. <br>So they blame you.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoliValentines?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cdnpoliValentines</a> —@gmbutts

Butts would also tangle with journalists, as he did over a Vogue photo shoot of Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau.

Did Mandela's wife borrow a $5,600 dress for the photo shoot? <a href=""https://t.co/lDufnQdN6t"">https://t.co/lDufnQdN6t</a> —@glen_mcgregor

Or critiques of Trudeau's availability to the media:

Really? PM Trudeau has done more open media availabilities in 3 months than PM Harper did in 3 years. <a href=""https://t.co/HukRmWjHIX"">https://t.co/HukRmWjHIX</a> —@gmbutts

In 2018, when the Liberals announced tax incentives for the news industry, some journalists expressed concerns about what they might mean for journalistic independence.

I don’t agree with this thinking, obviously.<br><br>This public policy is not immune from being debated, by you or me or anyone else.

He certainly wasn't above scolding the media.

The (Stadler &) Waldorf school of journalism. <a href=""https://t.co/ROE5GIq0mM"">https://t.co/ROE5GIq0mM</a> —@gmbutts

Here, he made a veiled critique of Canadian media for following stories on Russian websites raising questions about the grandfather of Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and his ties to the Nazis.

Keep this for reference the next time a Russian foreign officer pitches you a story, Canadian journos. <br> <a href=""https://t.co/3KjTowWLJX"">https://t.co/3KjTowWLJX</a> —@gmbutts

He also went after the Globe and Mail in 2016 over an editorial about questions surrounding the birthplace of Liberal cabinet minister Maryam Monsef, comparing the article to the birther movement that falsely claimed former U.S. president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.

The Globe and Mail endorses a homegrown Canadian birther movement. Breathtaking. <a href=""https://t.co/ljKsSyoBtP"">https://t.co/ljKsSyoBtP</a> —@gmbutts

Which sparked its own backlash with some journalists.

No, that was definitely not the Obama birthers' thing. They had many things, but their main thing was racism. <a href=""https://t.co/0Cchv4ZFCs"">https://t.co/0Cchv4ZFCs</a> —@gmbutts

Butts would also tangle with politicians. Conservative MP Erin O'Toole was a regular opponent.

Former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall, as well, got into an exchange over his survey about pipeline politics.

Butts would also get involved in Twitter skirmishes with policy analysts. In February 2016, he debated with experts over the Liberals' ant-ISIS plan.

<a href=""https://twitter.com/gmbutts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@gmbutts</a> but it is an incoherent argument. Why support combat but not do combat? Is Trudeau a pacifist? —@smsaideman

Twitter was also a tool to launch defences of his boss. He slammed critics who ridiculed Trudeau for using the term peoplekind instead of mankind during a town hall in Edmonton.

Although Trudeau later brushed it off as a ""dumb joke,"" Butts would take a step further, suggesting those who were so offended by the term were alt-right Nazi sympathizers.

The lesson to take from this joke being torqued by Infowars and other alt-right nazi friends of the Rebel is they're paying attention.

Butts regularly employed the alt-right characterization, and he used it again to label those he felt were prejudiced against asylum seekers.

108,Empty,2019-02-22T18:34:42Z,"Premier insists the Progressive Conservatives are not charging for access after the Star revealed that lobbyists have been enlisted to sell $1,250 tickets to a party fundraiser next week.","Speaking to reporters in Washington after the Star revealed consultants are peddling tickets to the PC leader’s dinner, Ford defended his party.

Premier Doug Ford insists lobbyists have no influence on him — even though they are selling $1,250 tickets for his Progressive Conservative fundraiser next week.

But Ford emphasized Friday that lobbyists have no sway in his administration, whether they sell Tory tickets or not.

“We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25 spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25 fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should clear $2 million for the governing party.

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford, no one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said.

As first disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories asked lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government — including a ban on corporate and union donations — that make it challenging to sell tickets.

“So they can come, they can support us, it’s no different. Lobbyists are here, the lobbyists are in Canada, they want to get their point through, good luck to them. But we’re going to do the right thing for the people.”

Companies could once purchase entire tables for such dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. Now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual.

In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a prominent firm run by Conservative and Liberal lobbyists, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.”

“The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table please let us know and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote.

Benedetti, who is registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month.

“I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said.

Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was “tremendous pressure” put on his firm to sell tickets.

“You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” he said.

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.”

“This scheme is laced with threats about who will be allowed into Doug Ford’s back rooms, and who will be locked out,” said Natyshak.

“People were clear that they wanted to get rid of cash-for-access schemes when they got rid of Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals. But Doug Ford is making things much worse for them,” he said.

Green Leader Mike Schreiner noted that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.”

“I will not stand quietly by while money, power and influence flow freely between government and lobbyists,” said Schreiner, who considering asking Elections Ontario’s chief electoral officer Greg Essensa to look into the allegations.

“Last year, the premier quietly raised donation limits and ushered in the return of cash-for-access events, burying these rule changes in the fall economic statement and now we have allegations the PC party is pressuring lobbyists to sell fundraising tickets at the risk of losing the ear of cabinet,” he said.

Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.”

Last fall, the Tories quietly opened a loophole in the electoral finance reform bill by repealing a section that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees.

The change means that a company or union could theoretically make a political contribution in someone else’s name.

But the government said it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

Ford noted Friday that his government’s rules “match” the federal campaign finance laws.

The previous Liberal government was forced to reform the law after a Star investigation three years ago.

Meet OOM: Could this off-the-grid technology be the future of electricity?

(OOM Energy)

In August 2003, a sagging high-voltage power line in northern Ohio brushed up against some tree branches. Before long, three transmission lines had short-circuited and 45 million people in the northeastern U.S., as well as 10 million in Ontario, were in the dark — for hours, days, in some cases even a week.

It was a tough lesson for power companies, who implemented recommendations from the investigation that followed (such as keeping power lines away from trees). But the fact is, most of us still rely on the grid to provide electricity to our homes and businesses.

If Craig Clydesdale has his way, however, that will all change. He's the founder and CEO of OOM Energy, an Oakville, Ont.-based company that has developed a new way of providing electricity to customers.

""You're looking at the next big thing,"" Clydesdale said. What he's referring to is his company's Integrated Energy Platform (IEP), an on-site power system that aims to take buildings off the sometimes unstable electrical grid while also reducing their carbon footprint. Oh, and it's portable.

OOM's unit shouldn't be confused with a generator, which creates mechanical energy and delivers it only as a backup, when existing systems fail. What Clydesdale's company provides is private, continuous electricity with no upfront cost for the unit. The customer just pays a regular bill directly to OOM each month.

So what's in the unit? The current version uses natural gas, a battery and an inverter. While it's not a zero-emissions solution, Clydesdale said the system can be modified to include greener energy as it develops and becomes more affordable — such as solar panels or hydrogen, which he believes to be the future.

The unit only generates power when it has to. That's unlike power lines that deliver electricity to your home, which have to be constantly running just in case. OOM uses artificial intelligence to calculate a building's power requirements, so its customers only get ""what they need,"" Clydesdale said.

At the moment, OOM units are being sold to organizations and businesses with large demands, such as ones in agriculture and industrial manufacturing. But they've also been used in high-rise apartments and multi-residential units.

Last month, Stoneridge Ice Centre in Burlington, Ont., became the first arena in North America to adopt OOM's new technology. The estimate is that their annual electricity costs will drop from $180,000 to $145,000 — a savings of 20 per cent.

Although Clydesdale has a unit for his home, right now, OOM's main focus is on commercial and multi-residential buildings.

Clydesdale doesn't know of anything like OOM on the market, but he said he'd be happy to see others rise to the challenge of a green, off-grid solution. At a time when more ice storms are predicted for parts of Canada with climate change, Clydesdale said this type of technology could be the security people are looking for.

He said it's potentially ""a multitrillion-dollar industry. There's lots of room for all of us.""

Given Trump's climate inaction, Green New Deal could be a political winner

(Saul Loeb/Getty Images)

CBC business columnist Don Pittis weighs in on the Green New Deal, the sweeping plan put forth by left-leaning members of the Democratic Party in the U.S. to address climate change.

To conservatives who understand the science of climate change and its potentially dire economic effects, it may seem strange that the decision on whether to halt it has become a left-right issue.

With the announcement of a major climate action initiative in the U.S., that polarization has become even more pronounced.

The idea of a transformational project to boost the economy using green technology has been around for decades. But now, an emerging left-leaning faction of the Democratic Party has offered up the Green New Deal, where fighting climate change is firmly anchored in a platform of wider social change, including items such as eliminating poverty and increasing income equality.

""I think [the Green New Deal] does mix a lot of things that are not necessarily compatible, and subordinates the goal of reducing carbon emissions to a lot of other things on the liberal social democratic wish list,"" Mark Cameron, executive director of Canadians for Clean Prosperity, told me on the phone last week.

A firm supporter of carbon pricing as a business-friendly way of cutting CO2 without distorting the economy, Cameron was director of policy and research for former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.

But as others told me, the hostility of U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters to the whole idea of fighting climate change has surrendered that political turf to the Democrats.

As the name implies, the Green New Deal is unabashedly a social project, harking back to the original New Deal introduced by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to combat the inequality, unemployment and hunger of the Great Depression.

While critics insist it was actually the massive stimulation from spending on the Second World War that rebooted the U.S. economy, the original New Deal set the tone for a more egalitarian social and economic system that formed the basis of the postwar shared prosperity.

Without a climate change plan of its own, the Trump Republicans have given their Democratic opponents lots of flexibility to formulate a final green policy they think will appeal to voters.

With U.S. unemployment at record lows, massive public sector stimulus on green projects would likely be hard to justify. But if the rich keep on getting richer as the economy goes into recession, and if public worries over the effects of climate change continue to grow, a Green New Deal may catch the voters' imagination as a way to kill two birds with one stone.

The Big Picture: Traffic congestion

Sitting in traffic is no fun, but getting around in some cities is clearly worse than in others. According to research by traffic-analysis firm Inrix, the worst traffic is in Bogota, Colombia — drivers there lost 272 hours to congestion in 2018. As you'll see from the chart below, notoriously bad Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal come off looking almost manageable in comparison.

What's on your mind?

Last week's story on household waste elicited some interesting emails. One reader pointed out that black plastic, which we cited as something that can't be recycled, is actually recycled in some communities across Canada. The reader helpfully clarified that ""municipalities have different rules because they've invested in different technologies. That makes it tough for consumers and businesses.""

We'll be returning to the topic of zero waste in the coming weeks and months, but if you have comments or suggestions on this topic, we'd be happy to hear them.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

For anyone with a bird feeder, putting out food for our winged friends during the scarcity of the winter months seems like a small act of mercy. But an ecologist at the University of Alberta points out that it also puts birds at risk of accidentally colliding with windows or coming face to face with urban predators.

As Emily Chung wrote in a story last year, online shopping is a significant generator of carbon emissions. Given Amazon's outsize influence in this space, there's reason to be encouraged by the company's announcement this week that it's aiming to make all its shipments ""net zero carbon."" The first target: Making 50 per cent of its shipments net zero by 2030.

A shining example for other sun-drenched cities? A second-year engineering student at the University of Calgary has done research that suggests the city could generate nearly a quarter of its annual power demand if residential rooftops were outfitted with solar panels.

Snow problem: Electric cars in Winterpeg

(Bryce Hoye/CBC)

The coldest days in Canadian winters wreak havoc on vehicle batteries, and so you'd think the problem would be especially acute for electric vehicles (EVs). But many EV owners say that impact isn't a big deal once the rubber hits the snow.

A recent cold snap that swept through Canada provided an interesting case study for Winnipeg, where temperatures were in the -35 C range. On days like that, Jordan Loewen said his Tesla Model 3 was losing as much as 40 per cent of its battery range. Heating the cabin of the car was the main culprit, as it is for many EV owners.

This is the first Winnipeg winter for Loewen's black Tesla, which cost him a cool $75,000.

In ideal conditions, Loewen said his car can do 500 kilometres on a full charge. On the cold days of winter, however, he's getting more like 300 kilometres. On paper, that may look like a problem, but Loewen is a city commuter, and is only logging 60 kilometres a day on average.

Tesla advises against exposing its vehicles to extreme conditions — colder than -25 C, warmer than 60 C — for more than than 24 hours, but Loewen said he hasn't seen any issues.

""It performs and handles well in our winters, exceptionally so,"" said the 32-year-old Loewen.

Ross Redman paid $26,000 for his Mitsubishi i-MiEV seven years ago, and said it has stood the test of time (and temperatures) in Winnipeg.

""I've been told by several people that an electric car will never work in the winter time, and I use it every day,"" said Redman.

Like Loewen, Redman loses range in the winter — about 50 kilometres of the 100 kilometres he would get in the summer. But also like Loewen, he's a city driver, and isn't driving enough for that loss to change his habits.

Both say the loss in winter range is a small price to pay for vehicles that cost less than a few hundred dollars in fuel annually. Redman said he pays about $7 a month in the summer and $10 in the winter months on electricity bills to charge his little hatchback in his garage.

Redman acknowledges one big roadblock to owning an electric car in Manitoba is that he can't hop into his Mitsubishi and cover the province's vast distances without getting what is called ""range anxiety.""

That's because Manitoba, like some other provinces, is a patchwork of charging stations and lacks a supercharger network in particular. Those stations charge most electric vehicle batteries in less than an hour.

The Manitoba Electric Vehicle Association estimates a $4-million investment could establish enough supercharger stations around the province to make long road trips possible for EVs like Redman's, which lack the extended range of Loewen's fancy ride.

More specifically, he's facing criticsm for tapping what The Toronto Star calls ""high-powered lobbying firms"" to help sell tickets.

The 2019 Toronto Leaders' Dinner, as the event is called, will take place this Wednesday at The Toronto Congress Centre in Etobicoke from 5:30 p.m. until 9 p.m. It includes a welcome reception, a dinner program, a dessert reception and, at some point, a keynote speech from Ford featuring members of the PC Caucus.

If you missed Premier Doug Ford's $25-per-plate fundraiser in Kitchener last week, you can head to the PC party's $1,250-per-ticket fundraiser dinner in Etobicoke next month. No word yet if spaghetti is on the menu: https://t.co/ax3P33h4iG — James D.E. Jackson (@JamesDEJ) January 14, 2019

""Doug Ford and our Ontario PC Caucus accomplished a great deal in 2018, working to make life better and more affordable for Ontarians,"" reads a description of the event, which The Star says should net about $2 million for the Progressive Conservatives.

""There is much more to achieve in 2019, and to continue getting things done for the people, we need your help to build up our Party’s financial resources as quickly as possible.""

Some critics are taking the event's promotion as evidence that Ford and his colleagues are ""for sale,"" so to speak.

The premier told reporters in Washington on Friday that this is not the case.

""I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford, no one can influence my ministers or my caucus,"" he said, per The Star.

""Lobbyists are here, the lobbyists are in Canada, they want to get their point through, good luck to them,"" he continued. ""But we're going to do the right thing for the people.""

I asked Doug Ford about lobbyists selling tickets to his fundraisers. ""I can tell you one thing: No one can influence Doug Ford,"" he said, which is the same answer Kathleen Wynne gave when I uncovered her government's cash-for-access system #onpoli https://t.co/wdht5crYCs — Adrian Morrow (@AdrianMorrow) February 22, 2019

""It is wrong for ⁦[Ford]⁩ to bring back the same old cash for access events that got the Wynne Liberals in hot water,"" said Ontario Green Party leader Mike Schreiner on Twitter Thursday morning.

""Big money has no place in [Ontario politics]. I call on the Premier to remove the for sale sign on his door.""

""Who can pay for Doug Ford's $1250/plate fundraiser?"" said the Liberal advocacy group Progress Canada on Twitter similarly.

""The nurse working nights? No. The factory worker? No. The restaurant chef? No. Working people? No. Only the rich who work for the rich and against working Ontarians.""

Adding more fuel to the fire are allegations published this week by the Globe and Mail that members of Ford's caucus are pressuring lobbyists to sell tickets under the threat of losing future meetings with government officials.

""Several people helping sell tickets, both in the lobbying and industry worlds, said they are under heavy pressure — including through repeated phone calls and reminders of sales targets by party fundraisers — to fill the room amid concerns about their continued ability to get meetings with key decision-makers,"" reads the Globe piece.

Many are pointing out that the PC party's actions seem a little too similar to what got Kathleen Wynne's Liberal Party into hot water during their time in power.

111,Empty,2019-02-23T02:00:36Z,"Burnaby South voters should do themselves a favour by supporting a successful, accomplished local candidate who likely will be at the centre of power","Three federal byelections are being held Monday, in Burnaby South as well as the ridings of Outremont in Quebec and York–Simcoe in Ontario. The Burnaby race is centre stage because federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to win his first seat in Parliament here.

Singh — who has lived his entire adult life in Ontario — has parachuted into Burnaby South, which he believes is a safe NDP seat. Despite being party leader, a win for Singh isn’t guaranteed. He’s up against strong candidates from the other established federal parties. And while the NDP often wins in the area, in the 2015 election the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart only edged out the Liberal runner-up by one percentage point (35 per cent of the votes compared to 34).

The Liberal candidate this time is Richard Lee, a longtime Burnaby North MLA, who replaced Karen Wang mid-campaign when she resigned after making a racial social-media comment. Jay Shin, a rookie politician, lawyer and professor who grew up in Burnaby, is hoping to take the seat for the Conservatives — traditionally the runner-up party for area voters. Rounding out the field are People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler-Thompson and independents Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu.

This byelection offers Burnaby South voters a real opportunity to help set the agenda for Canada.

Under Singh’s leadership, the NDP has struggled, with just 14-per-cent support across the country, according to an aggregation of recent polls compiled by the CBC. A Leger poll this week found that just six per cent of Canadians believe Singh would make the best prime minister of the party leaders.

What is clear from national election results and polling is that Canadians don’t believe the NDP and its policies are best for Canada. Singh is poised to continue the party’s long tradition of failure, and it’s no surprise.

He strongly opposes the Trans Mountain pipeline, a project that is clearly in the national interest and essential to economic development in Western Canada. Meanwhile, he favours the $40-billion LNG Canada project, although he faces pressure to oppose that project by NDP members with impractical climate change views.

With the NDP’s frequent opposition to major economic developments that provide jobs and prosperity, combined with its support for higher taxes and endless growth to government programs, it’s understandable that the vast majority of federal voters don’t view the NDP as a viable party to lead the country.

Singh has also never fully explained his views on terrorism, specifically as it relates to calls for the creation of an independent Sikh state, Khalistan, in India. While he has condemned terrorism, he has appeared at events with Khalistan separatists who endorse violence and he also failed in a CBC interview to denounce Talwinder Singh Parmar, thought to be the organizer of the 1985 Air India bombing.

Lee also faces strong headwinds, especially with the turmoil in Ottawa surrounding the resignations of former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s principal secretary, after reports that Wilson-Raybould was pressured to interfere with the prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau’s fumbling attempts to initially deny the improper attempts to influence what must be independent prosecutors and his subsequent refusal to be transparent should be a grave concern to voters. Lee, an outspoken critic of China as a young man, recently has been criticized for being too close to the Chinese Communist Party, having been photographed dozens of times with Chinese officials.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin is new to politics but has a backstory that the diverse community of Burnaby South can embrace. He immigrated with his family, who ran a grocery store in Burnaby, where he grew up. He has two undergraduate degrees, a master of business administration and a law degree. Shin practises business law, has taught at two Korean universities and teaches at the University of B.C.’s law school.

Shin says the top priority for voters he speaks with in the riding is to rein in excessive spending by the current Liberal government and return to balanced budgets. That’s a worthy goal if we are going to maintain the services Canadians rely on without further taxing middle-class families already stretched to the limit, particularly in Metro Vancouver.

With the Conservatives climbing above the Liberals in the polls and possibly forming the next federal government, Burnaby South voters should do themselves a favour by supporting a successful, accomplished local candidate who likely will be at the centre of power.

Most participants were wearing yellow vests - a sign of affiliation with the country's own newly-formed grass-roots protest movement.

Sputnik sat down with Cody Payant — a Yellow Vests activist from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, who's been following the convoy and organized similar protests of smaller scale in his home region. Payant is also a political figure, aiming for People's Party of Canada candidacy in the upcoming 43rd federal election.

Sputnik: You've been following the ""United We Roll for Canada"" convoy going from Red Deer, Alberta, to Ottawa. What are their demands? Is it only about the ""pipeline"", or are there other topics at play?

Cody Payant: The ""pipeline"" is definitely the main one. Justin Trudeau is our prime minister and his father, Pierre Trudeau, used to be our prime minister, and he started what is called ""the National Energy Programme"", which kind of tried to nationalize pipelines, to implement state ownership on energy infrastructure projects. And now, with Justin Trudeau, with the purchase of the pipeline for 4.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money — there is a big problem, because they spent all that taxpayer money on that pipeline, but they can't build it. So, they more or less extorted Canadian taxpayers to pay for this ""imaginary pipeline"", that they can't build. And Canadians are really upset; that has become a big issue for Yellow Vests.

Here' s what may eventually turn into Canada's own grass-roots mass protest movement. A truck convoy moved all the way across the country from Red Deer, Alberta, to Ottawa to protest against federal govt policies. https://t.co/F84fkA5YGu — Denis Bolotsky (@BolotskySputnik) February 21, 2019

Canadians want pipelines because we have some of the cleanest oil and energy practices and industry anywhere in the world. And right now, compared to the United States, the United States is the only country where we can export our oil to, we are locked to them as one customer right now. Our oil is discounted big time right now, so we want a pipeline to Tidewater, so we can access world markets, whether it be Southeast Asia, or Asia.

The Transmountain pipeline will increase the value of Canadian oil by unlocking access to world markets. The carbon tax, over regulation, and state control of our energy sector is only delaying the commercial viability of large scale renewables as a replacement. Vote PPC. pic.twitter.com/HcCZSF4HRX — 🇨🇦 Cody Payant 🌾 (@PayantCody) January 22, 2019

So, that was a huge issue, but also, some other issues with Yellow Vests are the United Nations — that's huge. The United Nations and the General Assembly — all of the people that sit in the General Assembly and on the councils — they are all unelected, and sometimes they are unelected in their own countries — the member states that comprise the UN. So, it's been a gradual ""creep"" — it kind of started after the World War [II]. So, the UN-2030 Agenda lays on all of these items that they are suggesting that the member states comply with. So, what the Yellow Vests sees is that Canada is a sovereign country, with sovereign borders; we need to protect our sovereignty as a sovereign nation, respect our ability to legislate ourselves, respect our representative democracy and our constitution. The Yellow Vests, basically, are patriotic, they want to preserve our sovereignty, they want to protect our sovereignty from supranational legislation of the UN trying to supersede Canadian law.

Sputnik: Both Canadian MPs speaking at the rally in Ottawa's Parliament Hill, and Canadian mainstream media seemed to have been avoiding the topics of the UN migrant compact, border policy and similar ""patriotic subjects"". Why is that?

Cody Payant: Part of the reason could be that pipelines are such a big issue right now, and there is a kind of ""competition"", I guess, between two ""pro-pipeline"" parties — the People's Party of Canada — and I'm a candidate with that party, and the Conservative Party of Canada, which also supports pipelines… I think both parties are trying to spread the message, so that could be a partisan thing.

And listening to Canadians is always the right thing for Canada. — 🇨🇦 Cody Payant 🌾 (@PayantCody) February 21, 2019

But, also, immigration is a more contentious issue. The pipeline is a contentious issue, but immigration, all over the world, in a lot of places has become a very contentious issue. So, that's why it could be risky from a political perspective to talk about it. The migration pact is something that a lot of countries signed on to, and a lot of countries didn't. And there is a whole list of countries that refused to do so — the Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, and the list goes on. Essentially, the issue that the Yellow Vests have with the Migration Pact is that — it's not pro- or against immigration, it's more of wanting Canada to be able to have the autonomy to legislate its own laws on immigration. We want Canada to make laws, not the UN.

Sputnik: You're planning to run for public office, and once you announced that you're joining the Yellow Vests movement and then media started speculating about the link between your membership in the People's Party and your Yellow Vests activism being seen as something rather controversial. Do you feel that there is a bias in the media or some kind of pressure?

Cody Payant: It is hard. I got involved in the Yellow Vests because it made its way to Canada from France after I had announced in September that I want to run for the nomination. So, it's kind of aligned. The Yellow Vests issues that they are advocating for are that they want, in terms of being patriotic Canadians who want to protect our sovereignty as a country, [to] protect our ability to legislate ourselves and remove the government from overregulating our industries and pipelines. As you said, the biased media is state-owned here in Canada. CBC gets 1.6 billion dollars per year in tax money, so it's basically a partisan tool for the liberal government right now. And it goes like that not only for Liberals — also for Conservatives — any party that's at power. It's state broadcasting.

Armchair journalists, who didn’t bother attending the #UnitedWeRoll protest in Ottawa claimed the protesters were ""racists"".



But @GraemeCGordon was actually at the protest, and the Cdns he spoke to were ordinary blue-collar folk from across the country.https://t.co/JB9esNk9vc — True North (@TrueNorthCentre) February 22, 2019

Cody Payant: So, they tried to paint me, and others too, in the party, as somehow being ""risky"". But for me personally, I have faith in Canadians. I know that there have been extremist groups trying to get involved in the Yellow Vests, trying to hijack it, to make it into something that it's not, whether it's ""Soldiers of Odin"", or ""Antifa"", or other groups like that. But, as a whole, I have faith in Canadians. Canadians will keep it on the tracks and overcome the hate, overcome the division and really keep it on the tracks.

First issued by the United States in 1823, it warned European powers against renewed colonization of the Western Hemisphere. Presented as anti-imperialist, the Monroe Doctrine was later used to justify US interference in regional affairs.

We may be seeing the development of a Canadian equivalent. The ‘Trudeau Doctrine’ claims to support a “rules-based order”, the “constitution” and regional diplomacy independent of the US. But, history is likely to judge the rhetoric of the Trudeau Doctrine as little more than a mask for aggressive interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation.

For two years Canada’s Prime Minister has been conspiring with Juan Guaidó’s hardline Voluntad Popular party to oust the government of Nicolas Maduro. In May 2017 Trudeau met Lilian Tintori, wife of Voluntad Popular leader Leopoldo López. The Guardian recently reported on Tintori’s role in building international support for the slow-motion coup attempt currently underway in Venezuela. Tintori acted as an emissary for Lopez who couldn’t travel to Ottawa because he was convicted of inciting violence during the “guarimbas” protests in 2014. According to a series of reports, Lopez is the key Venezuelan organizer of the plan to anoint Guaidó interim president. Canadian diplomats spent “months”, reports the Canadian Press, coordinating the plan with the hard-line opposition. In a story titled “Anti-Maduro coalition grew from secret talks”, the Associated Press reported on Canada’s “key role” in building international diplomatic support for claiming the head of the national assembly was president. This included Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland speaking to Guaidó “the night before Maduro’s swearing-in ceremony to offer her government’s support should he confront the socialist leader.”

Just before the recent Lima Group meeting in Ottawa Trudeau spoke with Guaidó and at the meeting of countries opposed to Venezuela’s president he announced that Canada officially recognized Guaido’s representative to Canada, Orlando Viera Blanco, as ambassador. The PM has called the leaders of France, Spain, Paraguay, Ireland, Colombia and Italy as well as the International Monetary Fund and European Union to convince them to join Canada’s campaign against Venezuela.

“The international community must immediately unite behind the interim president”, Trudeau declared at the opening of the Lima Group meeting in Ottawa.

At the UN General Assembly in September Canada announced it (with five South American nations) would ask the International Criminal Court to investigate the Venezuelan government, which is the first time a government has been formally brought before the tribunal by another member. Trudeau portrayed this move as a challenge to the Trump administration’s hostility to the court and described the ICC as a “useful and important way of promoting an international rules-based order.” In other words, Trudeau would challenge Washington by showing Trump how the “international rules-based” ICC could undermine a government the US was seeking to overthrow through unilateral sanctions, support for the opposition and threatening an invasion, which all contravene the UN Charter.

While Trudeau claims to support an “international rules-based order”, his government has adopted three rounds of illegal sanctions against Venezuela. It has also openly interfered in the country’s affairs, which violates the UN and OAS charters.

The Trudeau Doctrine emphasizes its interpretation of Venezuela’s constitution. On a whole series of platforms the Prime Minister has cited “the need to respect the Venezuelan Constitution”, even responding to someone who yelled “hands off Venezuela” at a town hall by lecturing the audience on article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution, which he claims makes the head of the National Assembly president. It doesn’t.

More fundamental to the Trudeau Doctrine is the mirage of a regional coalition independent of the regional hegemon – the United States.

Ottawa founded the anti-Maduro Lima Group coalition with Peru. Amidst discussions between the two countries foreign ministers in Spring 2017, Trudeau called his Peruvian counterpart, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, to “‎stress the need for dialogue and respect for the democratic rights of Venezuelan citizens, as enshrined in the charter of the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Democratic Charter.” But the Lima Group was established as a structure outside of the OAS largely because that organization’s members refused to back Washington and Ottawa’s bid to interfere in Venezuelan affairs, which they believe defy the OAS’ charter.

While many liberal Canadian commentators promote the idea that the Lima Group operates independently of Washington, their US counterparts are not deceived. In a story titled “Intervening Against Venezuela’s Strongman, Trump Belies ‘America First’” the New York Times described US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s influence over the Lima Group declaration of January 4 that rejected Maduro’s presidency. The paper reported that Pompeo is in “close contact with” Freeland “who has played a leading role in rallying global criticism of Mr. Maduro.”

The claim the Lima Group is independent of Washington conjures up a story Jean Chrétien recounts telling US President Bill Clinton in My Years as Prime Minister:

“Keeping some distance will be good for both of us. If we look as though we’re the fifty-first state of the United States, there’s nothing we can do for you internationally, just as the governor of a state can’t do anything for you internationally. But if we look independent enough, we can do things for you that even the CIA cannot do.”

While currently focused on Venezuela, the nascent Trudeau Doctrine has wider regional implications. Freeland has justified Canada’s aggressive interference in Venezuela’s affairs by saying “this is our neighbourhood” while Trudeau’s personal representative for the G7 Summits and recent appointee to the Senate, Peter Boehm told CBC, “this is our backyard, the Western hemisphere. We have a role here.”

Describing Latin America as “our backyard” is the language favoured by so-called Ugly American politicians seeking to assert the Monroe Doctrine. Latin Americans should beware of the emergence of Ugly Canadians promoting the Trudeau Doctrine.

On February 23 protests are planned in Canada and around the world calling for “No War on Venezuela!”

The NDP leader is running for a seat in the House of Commons in Burnaby South, one of three federal ridings holding byelections today.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

READ MORE: Liberal turmoil a ‘gift’ for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, expert says

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Unpacking the politics of the SNC-Lavalin affair

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. He won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015, and the Tories are expected to easily hang on tonight.

All three contests will give the Conservatives a glimpse of what, if any damage, they might sustain from the advent of the breakaway People’s Party of Canada, formed by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier.

116,Empty,2019-02-23T09:00:00Z,"It is fitting that the Orange Wave's last stand will begin Monday, with a byelection in the Quebec riding where it all started, Outremont.","In 2007, Tom Mulcair — then in self-imposed exile from Quebec politics — pulled off an unlikely win in a federal byelection, taking the Liberal stronghold of Outremont for the NDP.

It was only the second time the NDP had won a seat in Quebec. But from this narrow beachhead, Mulcair and then leader Jack Layton dramatically grew their support in the province.

Their effort, of course, culminated in the Orange Wave, when the party won 59 of Quebec's 75 seats in the 2011 general election and stormed into Opposition.

Since then, though, NDP support in Quebec has slowly frittered away.

Under Mulcair's leadership, it was cut down to 16 seats in the 2015 election. Early predictions ahead of this fall's contest suggest the party won't win more than a handful of seats, if that.

It is fitting, then, that the Orange Wave's last stand seems to have begun with a byelection Monday in the riding where it all started: Outremont.

Mulcair's shadow

The seat became open when Mulcair quit federal politics last summer, after carrying much of the blame for the party's disappointing performance in 2015.

Julia Sanchez, a former international development executive who lived in Ottawa for many years before recently moving back to Outremont, is now carrying the NDP banner.

She acknowledged the former leader's shadow still looms large in the riding. His name, she said, ""comes up all the time. People were proud of Thomas Mulcair.""

One name that doesn't come up much in the riding, or elsewhere in Quebec, is the NDP's current leader, Jagmeet Singh.

His profile is particularly low in the province, and he was last spotted in Outremont in December.

Singh has been spending most of his time on his own byelection race in Burnaby South, where a loss Monday could be fatal to his leadership.

Sanchez, meanwhile, has been counting on support from the remaining local NDP heavyweights.

Montreal MPs Hélène Laverdière and Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet — two Orange Wavers who won't run in the next election — have been stumping for her. So too has Charles Taylor, the 87-year-old philosopher who has run for the party several times.

""If we can get our people, our base, out to vote … then we will win,"" Sanchez said during a recent interview at a cafe in the riding.

But the party's sympathizers are tempering their expectations ahead of Monday's vote.

""In this byelection the NDP is actually the underdog,"" said Karl Bélanger, a former NDP strategist who worked closely with Layton and Mulcair.

""If the NDP finishes with a strong second place, that would already be a win for the party.""

The most likely scenario on Monday, in his view, is for Outremont to return to the Liberal fold. Before Mulcair's win in 2007, the Grits had held the riding almost continuously since the 1935 election.

The Liberal candidate, Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former party staffer, ran against Mulcair in the last election, finishing second by more than 10 points.

This time, she said, she benefits not only from a bit of name recognition, but also the record of the Trudeau government, pointing to investments in public transit, social housing and the Canada Child Benefit.

The Liberals, though, are heading into Monday's three byelections weighed down by the controversy surrounding the government's alleged interference in the prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, which is accused of bribing Libyan officials.

Several recent polls suggest Liberal support has suffered in the wake of the scandal, and they are now in a dead heat nationally with the Conservatives.

Bendayan, though, doesn't believe the scandal is registering with voters in Outremont. ""I haven't heard much about it at the doors,"" she said.

A test of progressive bona fides

Outremont, in many ways, is an atypical riding in Quebec, so the results of Monday's vote may offer little foresight of what will happen in October's federal election.

French-speakers make up less than 50 per cent of Outremont's population, according to 2011 census figures. There are large communities of immigrants in one part of the riding; affluent francophones and progressive-leaning students in another.

Though the Conservatives, the Bloc Québécois, the Greens and Maxime Bernier's upstart People's Party of Canada are all running candidates, none of them is expected to be a factor.

It is, for all intents and purposes, a two-way race between the NDP and the Liberals.

With candidates for both parties indicating the environment is a major concern of voters, the Outremont byelection is providing a test of their progressive bona fides.

""People would like to see action on the environment, and they are very happy to have the leadership of the current Liberal government, particularly when we introduced the price on pollution,"" Bendayan said.

Sanchez, the NDP candidate, countered that the Liberals sacrificed their claim to climate leadership when the government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline.

""It really triggers disbelief, confusion and disillusionment,"" she said. ""How is it possible we spent all this money to buy an old pipeline?""

But the import of these policy differences may be offset by the low voter turnout that tends to characterize byelections, especially those in the dead of winter.

""That's when the machines come into play,"" said Bélanger, the former NDP strategist, referring to the organizational resources parties can mobilize on election day.

If nothing else, Monday's vote will offer a glimpse of how much remains of the mighty NDP machine in Quebec.",The Orange Wave's last stand? Outremont byelection a critical test for NDP in Quebec,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/ndp-byelection-outremont-1.5028818
117,Empty,2019-02-24T16:50:21Z,Trump’s nationalism is jeopardizing the rights and safety of Chinese students. The post The Bitter Fruit of Trump’s China Bashing: Anti-Asian Racism appeared first on Truthout.,"Donald Trump’s New Cold War with Beijing has caught Chinese foreign students at U.S. universities in its crosshairs.

The Trump administration has tightened restrictions on their visas, accused them of spying for the Chinese state and its high tech giants, and in the process whipped up a climate of anti-Asian racism.

Trump’s policies yielded bitter fruit most recently at Duke University. The chair of the graduate program in biostatics, Megan Neely, in the wake of complaints from a faculty members about Chinese grad students “speaking Chinese (in their words VERY LOUDLY)” in the student lounge and study areas, wrote an email scolding students for speaking their native language.

She told students to “commit to using English 100 percent of the time” while in department buildings or “any other professional setting.” Even worse she warned them that if they didn’t it might impact their ability to get internships and jobs: “PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak Chinese.”

This was not the first time that Neely had criticized students for speaking a language besides English in their private time. Last year she sent a message to all the biostatistics students saying, “I don’t like being the language police [but] … speaking in your native language in the department may give faculty the impression that you are not trying to improve your English skills and that you are not taking this opportunity seriously.”

She also warned of “potential downstream effects” that might compromise their professional advancement in the biostatics program and their employability.

These were no idle threats. The two professors whose complaints prompted her most recent email asked for and received photographs of the Chinese students from Neely with the expressed intent of discriminating against them.

Chinese students were shocked by this blatant racism. One PhD student in Chemistry, Chi Liu, said, “All of us are angry. We feel offended. You have this email to the Chinese students saying … if you speak Chinese you will be remembered and identified, and that will affect your performance. That is very serious.”

Duke’s Asian American Student Organization and International Association issued a joint statement that pointed out, “For international students, speaking in their mother tongue is a means of comfort and familiarity with a home and culture that is oftentimes suppressed within the United States. … Within the bounds of one’s personal conversations, people should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish — to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory.”

Neely’s shocking email provoked a wave of criticism at the university. A group of “concerned students” created a petition, which demanded the school investigate Neely and the two professors collected over 2,000 signatures from the campus community.

The uproar even spread to China. On the country’s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, the hashtag “Duke University Bans Speaking Chinese” was viewed over 6.7 million times.

Caught in a spiraling scandal, Duke demoted Neely from her chair position and issued an apology. The dean of the medical school, Dr. Mary Klotman wrote, “To be clear: there is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected.”

Duke may have resolved this crisis for now, but Trump’s New Cold War will only provoke more attacks on Chinese students. He has raised tariffs on China’s exports to the US, targeted its companies with sanctions and has begun a military buildup to confront Beijing.

Trump is extending his economic nationalist program against China into the higher education system.

Universities and colleges are directly integrated into the American state through funding as well ties to the military-industrial complex. As a result, the higher education system is linked to the interests of American capitalist class and its imperial domination of the world. Universities and colleges are what Hal Draper called knowledge factories that reproduce the ideas of the dominant class, generate scientific innovations for corporations, and also train different classes for their roles in ruling, managing and working in American capitalism.

During the period of neoliberal globalization, however, the US higher education has undergone a transformation both in function and student composition. First, it became increasingly internationalized, creating connections with higher education systems of other countries.

Second, the increasing privatization of public universities has opened them to a growing number of foreign students, especially ones from China. States across the country have cut funding, universities have dramatically raised tuition, and students have gone into massive debt—now over $1.3 trillion—to afford a degree.

In the wake of the Great Recession, both public and private universities have suffered declining enrollment as American students balk at the enormous debt entailed in getting a degree. Higher education bosses have made up for that drop by luring foreign students who pay full tuition, room and board to attend their undergraduate and graduate programs.

This isn’t simply lucrative for some universities, it’s essential at a time when many, including prestigious institutions like Hampshire College, are struggling to keep their doors open.

As a result, the total foreign students in universities has doubled in the last two decades to over 1 million today. Chinese students have grown the fastest increasing by five fold since 2000 to over 360,000, about 35% of the total.

The overall value of this trade in students is estimated at $42.4 billion for the American economy, a sum greater than the $21.6 billion exports in soybeans and rivalling exports of $51 billion in pharmaceuticals and $53 billion in automobiles.

Duke is an example of the overall pattern. In their master’s program in biostatics heretofore overseen by Neely, Chinese students account for 36 out of a total of 55, and, in the whole graduate program, 1,300 out of 8,500.

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese ruling class and state have used this opening to advance their interests. The Chinese elite are now sending students to undergraduate and graduate programs.

These students overwhelmingly enter undergraduate and graduate programs in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the so-called STEM disciplines) as well business administration.

After graduation, some stay and staff key sectors of American big business particularly in high tech while others return to China to bolster the competitiveness of the country’s corporations.

The Chinese state has encouraged their high tech national champions like Huawei to establish contracts with U.S. research institutions to bolster their standing as world leaders in research and development.

At the same time, the Beijing is worried that their students might be influenced by liberal and radical ideas that might encourage them to challenge the Communist Party’s autocratic rule back home.

Therefore, Beijing has established about 150 chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholar Associations on campuses throughout the US. These both organize social activities for students as well as keep tabs on them.

China has established Confucian Institutes on over 100 campuses to promote Chinese language and culture, provide services for Chinese nationals teaching in the US, and facilitate cultural exchanges. They also use the institutes to influence American the universities, registering protest against speakers the state considers anti-Chinese like the exiled religious leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.

The Communist Party also attempts to influence American academics portrayals of China by threatening to deny them visas to visit and conduct research in the country. For example, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, editors of The Tiananmen Papers about the Communist Party’s massacre student and workers to quell the uprising in 1989, have been denied visas ever since the publication of their book.

In response, Trump has initiated a campaign against the Chinese state and its corporations influence over universities as well as against Chinese foreign students, their rights and their organizations. Trump aims to discipline the nation’s higher education system to serve “America First.”

Trump’s lapdog Mike Pence’s announced this offensive against “the enemy within” American universities in his speech at the Hudson Institute. Pence warned, “The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.”

Pence charged China with creating a “culture of censorship” in universities. He complained that “Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.”

Then — in formulations worthy of the poster “Is Your Washroom’s Breeding Bolsheviks?” — he denounced “the Chinese Students and Scholars Association” for alerting “Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.”

Of course, all of this reeks of hypocrisy. Trump and the right are enemies of academic freedom and scientific thought. They are conducting McCarthyite attacks against progressive academics as advocates of “cultural Marxism,” policing students and academics who are advocates of Palestinian liberation, waging war on the humanities, and are aiming to reduce the function of every level of education to the narrow interests of the American state and corporations in dominating the world system.

Double talk aside, Trump has already begun implementing his plan. He has issued an order instructing public universities to terminate all contracts with Huawei or federal funding would be cut.

And the schools have all obeyed. For example, the University of California at Berkeley has banned any further research projects with Huawei, which has donated $7.8 million to the school over the last two years.

Trump has extended the attack on corporation to Chinese students. The US intelligence agencies are warning universities that they are spying for Beijing and stealing intellectual property for its state corporations and national champions.

To put a stop to this supposed threat, he has denied and delayed issuing visas to Chinese students and threatened to reduce visas for those studying robotics, aviation, and high tech.

Trump’s racist advisor, Stephen Miller, almost convinced the administration to impose a total ban on Chinese nationals studying in the US.

Far from standing up against Trump’s China bashing and protectionism, the Democratic Party, including its progressive and even socialist wing, has joined his chorus. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has denounced against the neoliberal establishment for promising that open markets would bring about democracy in China.

She wrote, “Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Instead, efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for competitors to rise up and lash out. Russia became belligerent and resurgent. China weaponized its economy without ever loosening its domestic political constraints.”

Similarly, Bernie Sanders, who has become a spokesperson for progressive internationalism, has in fact long advocated an economic nationalist program against China.

In 2011, for example, he denounced the Smithsonian Museum for selling busts of American presidents made in China. He complained “that a museum owned by the people of the United States, celebrating the history of the United States, cannot find companies in this country employing American workers that are able to manufacture statues of our founding fathers, or our current president.”

More recently he supported Trump’s tariff war with China, writing, “I strongly support imposing stiff penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the U.S. and throughout the world.”

Such nationalism can only breed anti-Chinese and more generally anti-Asian racism. Barbara Ehrenreich plumbed the depths of such bigotry recently when she tweeted, “I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering Marie Kondo learns to speak English.”

This xenophobia is only the latest expression of the toxic history of anti-Asian prejudices and laws that began with the Chinese Exclusion Act and continued through the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the racist demonization of the Vietnamese during the US war on their country, and the recent bigoted caricatures of Koreans during Trump’s stand-off with Kim Jung-un.

Unsurprisingly, the American political class’s China bashing has triggered a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination. NPR reports that “hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are rising exponentially. A report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations found that crimes targeting Asian-Americans tripled in that county between 2014 and 2015.”

And since the Trump administration’s rise to power, they increased ever more. There was a 20 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Pacific Americans in 2017.

Trump’s Islamophobia, immigrant bashing, and hostility to foreign students and specifically Chinese students drove down international enrollment by 3.3 percent in 2016 and by 6.6 percent in 2017.

Indian graduate school applications dropped by 12% in 2017. While Chinese student enrollment is still increasing it has begun to slow from an increase of 8.1 percent in 2014-15 to 6.8 percent in 2015-16 and 3.1 in 2017-2018.

Those that remain have soured on the US. One study by Purdue University found that the percentage of foreign students holding negative views of the US jumped from 29 percent in 2016 to 42 percent in 2018.

One anonymous student told the South China Post, “More students, including myself, have even considered returning to China as a plan B if we can’t find a job in the US, and some of them are searching for jobs in China simultaneously.”

But, as the Post notes, “the job market for new graduates on the other side of the globe is not much better, as Trump’s trade war begins to cause sweeping lay-offs and hiring freezes in China’s tech industry.” These students are thus caught between two powers struggling for dominance in a crisis-ridden system.

With Trump tearing at the internationalized structure of American higher education and trying to push out Chinese students, some universities and high tech businesses have begun to worry about a possible drop in the pool of Chinese students they can recruit from.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign went so far as take out a $60 million insurance policy to protect against any sudden drop in Chinese enrollment.

The conflict between the US and China is also spilling into other countries with educational systems with large Chinese student populations. For example, when Trump forced Canada to detain Huawei’s the chief financial officer, Meng Whanzhou, on charges that the company violated sanctions on Iran, China responded by threatening to withdraw all its 77,000 students if Ottawa sent Meng to the US to stand trial.

Chinese students account for a large share of the 40 percent increase in foreign students since 2013. These pay an average of $27, 159 a year in tuition—4 times what Canadian residents pay—and spend over $15 billion a year in Canada. Thus, they are an important part not just of the country’s big business in higher education but also the broader economy.

Moody’s Investors Services went so far as to warn “that the intensification of political tensions between the Government of Canada and the government of China poses credit risks for Canadian universities.”

Back in the US, university presidents became so concerned that 65 of them penned a letter supporting a legal challenge to Trump’s threat to ban international students for overstaying their visas.

Some high tech bosses have similarly protested about the loss of access to foreign students in American universities. They point to the fact that about a quarter of new companies worth a billion dollars were started by moguls who first came to the US as students.

Thomas Harnisch from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities said, “International graduate students are pivotal to our economic system, these students go on, many of them earn master’s degrees and PhDs in many highly-needed fields. They’re incredibly important not only to our universities, but our economy as well.”

But the logic of the spiraling inter-imperial rivalry between the US and China will likely continue to pry apart the inter-penetration of their educational systems. The US is already trying to retool its own education system to yield more American talent in the STEM fields and China may redirect its students to its own rapidly improving higher education institutions and those of countries less hostile to it.

Amidst this intensifying conflict, socialists must take a clear stand against China bashing no matter whether it comes from right-wing Republicans like Trump or progressives like Warren and Sanders; it is rank American nationalism that binds workers to their exploiters against their fellow workers in China.

Instead we must unite just like the Duke students did against the racist attacks on Chinese students, defend their right to speak their language of choice, agitate against any restrictions on their visas, and build a movement among both native and foreign students and workers for our common interests against the university bosses, their capitalist masters, and their state overseers.

Such organizing will also open up opportunities to build the international workers movement. Some of these students are part of the developing new left on universities in China that has suffered government repression for organizing solidarity with workers on strike. They should be considered part of our emerging new socialist movement.

We should build this common struggle without in any way supporting the Chinese state, which is a rising imperialist power in the world system that oversees the exploitation of its own population, the oppression of subject nations like Tibet and national minorities like the Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly exploits third world countries in pursuit of raw materials and outlets for its surplus capital.

The slogan for our solidarity movement must therefore be: “Neither Washington, Nor Beijing, But International Socialism.”

118,Empty,2019-02-24T15:27:15Z,"A standard political scandal involves a person who did something wrong out of negligence or motivations of money, personal ambition, sex, etc. But the SNC-Lavalin affair so far lacks those elements.","Politics is cyclical; what goes around usually comes around again, as politicians and institutions follow long-term patterns of behaviour.

But the still-developing SNC-Lavalin story and resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould from cabinet is bewildering and does not fit traditional patterns of Canadian politics.

Three things stand out: The complex nature of the “scandal,” the puzzling resignation of Gerald Butts and the actions of Wilson-Raybould.

First is the nature of the “scandal.” A typical political scandal involves a person who did something wrong out of negligence or motivations of money, personal ambition, sex, etc.

But this is a much more complicated and abstract affair. No one is suggesting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his principal secretary Butts or anyone else in the Liberal Party did anything to line their own pockets, unlike the sponsorship scandal in the early 2000s in which the PMO turned a blind eye as many Liberals benefited handsomely.

Instead, Trudeau and Butts saw political advantage for the government to lighten up on SNC-Lavalin. There are political and economic interests that still clearly carry some weight in Québec.

In public affairs, what is legally wrong is not necessarily unacceptable politically, and vice versa. (For example, despite his outrageous spending practices, Sen. Mike Duffy was acquitted in 2016 of actually breaking the law.)

Alleged pressure

From a legal viewpoint, the issue here is the alleged undue pressure on the attorney-general — which, politically, is an internal matter no different from any other time the PMO throws its weight around. Indeed, this is how Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick recently characterized the entire matter.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

From a political viewpoint, the more serious matter is the apparent demotion of Wilson-Raybould for not doing what the prime minister asked her to do, which, incidentally, is completely legal from a constitutional viewpoint. The economic dimension and the importance of SNC-Lavalin to Québec complicates matters even further, making this a unique multidimensional “scandal.”

The narrative is complicated and it’s not clear the story has caught fire with the general population. For example, one poll found that while 41 per cent of Canadians felt Trudeau had done something wrong in the affair, another 41 per cent said they weren’t sure.

Given the above muddled narrative, conventional wisdom suggested that the story might just drag out and diminish over time. But then came the bombshell resignation of Butts, which really defies past practice.

While other PMO staff have also had great power, they have ultimately been hired help; none have claimed such a deep personal friendship with the prime minister (Brian Mulroney hired many friends, but they generally did not rise to or stay at the top tier).

Nor have any of them played such a public role, like Butts’ independent activity on Twitter. In contrast, Harper’s four chiefs of staff avoided publicity so much that the media was forced to constantly run the same grainy photos of them over and over again.

Political triple play

It’s this triple play of power, friendship ties and public profile that made Butts so exceptional, and thus made it so startling to see him become the first to go in what had seemed a serious but not catastrophic matter.

As the Liberal Party learned to its sorrow after calling the Gomery inquiry into the sponsorship controversy, scandals are best smothered through equivocation and greyness rather than fanning the flames with dramatic action.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

Butts’ resignation was pretty much the most dramatic action possible and fits no pattern, provoking expectations that there is another shoe waiting to drop.

Finally, Wilson-Raybould’s actions do not fit the pattern of a ministerial resignation. When a minister resigns, they usually either disappear from view to sulk or do everything they can to own the story at the expense of the sitting government — in extreme cases setting up a virtual government-in-exile, like John Turner in relation to Pierre Trudeau or Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien.

Wilson-Raybould has done neither. While complicated by solicitor-client confidentiality (and we do not know who the anonymous sources are that have fed the story to the media), Wilson-Raybould has not adopted the usual techniques of non-stop interviews and op-eds to tell her side of the story, or even a non-story of: “There is so much I wish I could tell you but I can’t say anything.”

Wilson-Raybould’s strategy unclear

Instead, Wilson-Raybould has generally taken the high road. It’s hard to think of another ex-minister asking to come back and speak to the cabinet she just left or appearing in Parliament and then, quite reasonably, abstaining on a vote about herself.

Her intentions and strategy — if there is one — are unclear. It is worth noting that Canada’s first Indigenous woman attorney general and justice minister is doing politics differently and not following the well-worn playbook of dozens of male ex-ministers whose actions have been highly predictable and easily explained by sheer ego and pride.

The SNC-Lavalin story is still developing.

As more information and new developments emerge, we may be able to better fit it into typical patterns of Canadian political history. But for the moment, the SNC-Lavalin affair stands on its own as a complex, multi-dimensional story and not a typical political “scandal.”

The motivations of the key players remain unclear, and its long-term implications, especially for the coming election, are unknown.",Is the SNC-Lavalin controversy truly a scandal?,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/is-the-snc-lavalin-controversy-truly-a-scandal-112208

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in front of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh’s religious clothing is on some voters’ minds. “Some people are concerned about (the turban),” Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, “It’s definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.” Kathryn Furlong, 43, who attended the debate, said she voted for Sanchez, an economist with experience in humanitarian work and climate activism, at an advance poll. She has voted Liberal in the past “but never by conviction. Sometimes to keep the out the Conservatives.”

She said “it’s a sad notion and a sad question,” referring to anyone who would have an issue with the NDP leader’s expression of faith. “And I think political parties in Quebec try to exploit that issue.” Read more: Liberals hoping Outremont byelection win will lead to big gains in Quebec come October Maxime Bernier names People’s Party candidate for Montreal-area byelection Outremont has been represented by the NDP since former party leader Tom Mulcair won a 2007 federal byelection in what had long been a Liberal stronghold. Through the rise and fall of NDP popularity in Quebec, voters elected Mulcair another three times.

Mulcair stepped down last August and is now a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal and a political commentator. The NDP is currently polling fourth in Quebec, far from its highs when Jack Layton helped the party win the majority of the province’s seats in 2011. McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, a longtime NDP supporter who campaigned with Sanchez ahead of the byelection, said the cool reception Singh has so far received in Quebec is due to the fact he doesn’t yet have a seat in Parliament. Singh is his party’s candidate in one of the other two byelections Monday, in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Once he gets inside the House of Commons and is regularly in front of the cameras, Taylor predicted, “Quebecers will learn to like him. He’s very engaging, but he’s just not on television all the time.” The Coalition Avenir Quebec won last fall’s provincial election with a promise to prohibit some public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. But Taylor said Singh is “going to make a case for: ‘You can wear this kind of thing and be a perfectly reasonable person.’ And that’s something that Quebecers are able to listen to.” While an NDP loss Monday would further hurt the party in the province, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals arguably have more at stake. The party has 39 seats in Quebec leading into Monday’s vote and 179 nationally. Polling indicates Liberal support has declined across the country since the 2015 vote, and Trudeau is looking to pick up seats in Quebec to maintain his party’s majority in next fall’s general election. Outremont — where 36 per cent of residents are immigrants and 66 per cent are bilingual — is the kind of riding the Liberals must connect with in order to maintain their success in Quebec. Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former political aide, finished second to Mulcair in 2015. Her party has consistently led polls in the province since the last election. But in recent weeks it has been embroiled in controversy over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help engineering giant SNC-Lavalin escape criminal prosecution. The Montreal-based company is charged with bribery and fraud over its dealings in Libya, and it has said a conviction could lead to job losses and make it vulnerable to foreign takeover. Bendayan said it is journalists, not the people she meets when knocking on doors in the riding, who are asking about SNC-Lavalin. “No, people are not raising it,” she said in a recent interview recently at her campaign office. “People here are concerned with issues that affect their day-to-day lives. You’d be surprised how many people talk to me about the ice on the sidewalks.” Tom Boushel, 72, a Liberal volunteer who will be driving seniors to vote on Monday, said he doesn’t think the SNC-Lavalin issue will have as much of an impact in Quebec as elsewhere. “Quebecers are sensitive to the risk of job losses,” Boushel said, adding that Montrealers appreciate the prestige of having a global firm headquartered in their city. Boushel said “every elected official of every party ... every government has to fight to keep SNC going. I think in Quebec, I think they understand a little better.” The byelection is the first test for the Bloc Québécois under its new leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, who was acclaimed in January. The Bloc is hoping its candidate, author Michel Duchesne, will help the party become competitive once again in the riding. Jasmine Louras, a University of Ottawa law student, is representing the Conservatives, while James Seale, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, is running for the People’s Party of Canada, the party Maxime Bernier started after he quit the Conservatives last summer.

They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian conflict.","Syrian President Bashar Assad has visited Iran, his closest regional ally, for the first time since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, state media reported Monday.



Assad met with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, as well as other top officials in Tehran. It was a rare foreign trip for Assad, who has visited Russia twice since the outbreak of the conflict eight years ago.

Khamenei praised Assad for strengthening the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah against US and Western plans for the region.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it,"" Khamenei said.

""The creation of the buffer that the Americans are seeking to create in Syria is an example of these dangerous conspiracies which must be strongly denounced and resisted,"" Khamenei added.

Syrian state TV reported that Assad ""thanked the Islamic Republic's leadership and people for what they have given to Syria during the war."" The presidency said ""both sides expressed their satisfaction with the strategic levels reached between the two countries in all fields.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on 'I feel nothing' On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran from exile in France. When a reporter asked him how he felt upon his return to Iran, Khomeini replied: ""Nothing — I feel nothing."" Some analysts interpreted his remarks as the Shiite leader's idea about embarking on a ""divine mission"" where emotions hardly mattered.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The Shah ran out of time Two months before Khomeini's return to Iran, an estimated six to nine million people took to the streets in the country's major cities. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, compared to the violent September 8, 1978, protests. The Shah regime, headed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had realized that its time in power was over and that they could not stop Khomeini's return.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Even women rooted for Khomeini The revolutionary mood was so intense in Tehran that even many women celebrated Khomeini's return, ignoring the fact that Khomeini had slammed Shah's measures for women's emancipation in exile. In 1963, the Shah of Iran granted women the right to vote.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on A spectacle of exuberance In 1971, the Shah and his wife Farah Diba (seen in the picture) staged a lavish spectacle on the ancient site of Persepolis to mark the ""2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy."" Many heads of state attended the event. Khomeini, in his message from exile, condemned the monarchy as ""cruel, evil and un-Islamic.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Exile and death Under pressure from the Islamic Revolution, the Shah (left) had left Iran on January 16, 1979. After spending time in several countries, he succumbed to cancer on July 27, 1980 in Cairo, Egypt.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Consolidating power In the beginning, women's rights were not a major issue for the Islamic revolutionaries. They only imposed hardline Islam after consolidating their victory.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Soldiers join the revolution Upon Khomeini's return to Iran in 1979, the military did not confront the protesters. On February 11, the army declared itself neutral. Despite that, the revolutionaries executed several generals in February and April.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on New government Soon after his return, Khomeini declared the monarchy, the previous government and parliament illegal, and said he would appoint a government ""because of the fact that this nation believes in me."" According to Iran experts, it was not self-deception but reality.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The liberal face of the revolution Mehdi Bazargan, a scholar and pro-democracy activist, had campaigned against the Pahlavi dynasty, for which he had been incarcerated for several years. Khomeini appointed him as his first prime minister, although Bazargan was critical of him as well. Bazargan had called Khomeini a ""turbaned Shah"" after a meeting with the Ayatollah in Paris. He remained in office for only nine months.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Occupation of the US Embassy In November 1979, radical Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took the embassy staff hostage. The students were fearful of Shah's return to power with US help. Khomeini took advantage of the situation. He dismissed his opponents as ""US allies.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Ali Khamenei – guardian of the revolution In 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected by the expert council to succeed Khomeini. Khamenei, to this date, has the ultimate power over all state institutions. Although the 79-year-old does not have the same charisma as his predecessor, he represents the policies of Iranian hardliners who refuse to reform the system and continue to persecute dissidents.

Assad takes victory lap

Assad has retaken major cities and largely defeated rebels seeking to oust him with the support of Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The regime now controls most of the population and about two-thirds of the country, excluding a jihadi-controlled enclave in Idlib, Turkish zones in the north and a part of the country controlled by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Assad has vowed to bring all territory under the state's sovereignty.

Sitting in the room during Assad's meeting with Khamenei was General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force — the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has provided the Syrian regime with military and financial support.

During their meeting, Rouhani assured Assad that ""Tehran will be alongside Damascus in the stabilization, return of refugees and internal political process.""

The two presidents also discussed efforts by Russia, Iran and Turkey to end the Syrian conflict.

Iranian-backed Shiite militias have carved out a major role in Syria's security apparatus, and Tehran and Damascus have in recent months signed a string of economic deals that are likely to further increase Iran's long-term presence in the country.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Terror group? A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Renewed conflict with Israel? Iran and Hezbollah have increased their political and military strength through the war in Syria. Israel views this as a threat and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Israel has vowed to not let Iran and Hezbollah create a permanent presence in Syria. There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter

Tensions with Israel, US

Iran's growing influence in Syria has increased the prospect of a conflict with Israel, which has carried out dozens of attacks on Iranian forces, Shiite militia and Hezbollah.

US President Donald Trump announced in December that all American forces would leave Syria, but US officials recently said between 200-400 troops would remain in the country to support US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and prevent a resurgence of the ""Islamic State."" The US also has a base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border, where troops are expected to stay.

The decision to maintain a US troop presence is intended to prevent clashes between US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and NATO ally Turkey. It is also viewed as an attempt to stop the Assad regime and Iran-backed militia from widening their grip over more of Syria's territory.

121,Empty,2019-02-22T16:56:34Z,"This is too innocuous for the Americans, too wholesome for Latin America, too complicated for the Swiss and Scandinavians","The SNC-Lavalin affair is the quintessential Canadian controversy. It is alleged by unnamed sources that the former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was pressured to order her officials to assess fines rather than prosecute executives for financial crimes in the matter of SNC-Lavalin’s methods in seeking certain construction contracts in Libya, not a country where the Better Business Bureau rules commerce with an iron fist. At a later date, Ms. Wilson-Raybould consented to be moved to the position of associate minister of national defence and minister of veterans’ affairs, generally considered a demotion. When rumours circulated in the media about the propriety of allowing the company to pay fines rather than prosecute some of its executives, the prime minister defended the government, denied the rumours, and stated that the minister’s continued presence in the government was proof that the rumours were unfounded. The minister then resigned, but has since attended a full caucus meeting and had a calming effect on the Liberal MPs. She has said nothing publicly because of the delicacy of lawyer/client privilege opposite the prime minister, who has declined to waive the privilege. This is, in fact, bunk. The prime minister was not the client of the minister of justice in the SNC-Lavalin affair, and the prime minister doesn’t have any standing to waive anything on this subject, and his invocation of cabinet secrecy is twaddle, especially after the subject was aired before the entire Liberal caucus.

This is Canada, the land of Dudley Do-Right, and before him, of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald singing Rose-Marie in the Rockies

All government spokespeople deny any official misconduct or impropriety but the principal secretary and chief strategist of the regime, Gerald Butts, resigned, with the novel explanation that although nothing inappropriate had occurred, he thought the air should be cleared, so he walked the plank. This is the point at which this supposed scandal becomes uniquely Canadian. A minister belatedly resigns but informally continues to attend cabinet and expatiate on this issue and the government reinforces its protestations of absolute innocence of wrongdoing by the prime minister accepting the abrupt resignation of the most influential non-elected person in the government (and he also had a great deal more influence than almost all the elected ministers and MP’s).

I invite any reader to cite another country where a minister would consent to be shuffled down, maintain a complete silence while her father, an indigenous leader, has conducted an entertaining non-stop press conference denouncing the “white man’s justice,” although he has clearly gamed the system pretty well for himself, and the head of the prime minister’s office and closest collaborator of the prime minister resigns while proclaiming that nothing improper has been done and that he is only sacrificing himself to satiate the false accusers. This is too innocuous for the Americans and major European countries, too wholesome for Latin America, too complicated for the Swiss and Scandinavians, too discrete for Australia, and small potatoes for the Japanese. This is Canada, the land of Dudley Do-Right, and before him, of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald singing Rose-Marie in the Rockies. The story line of this scandal is absurd, but in its way, magnificently Canadian.

In so far as the aroma of scandal has arisen and been maintained at all, it is largely by the usual remarks about shabby Quebec business ethics and large companies being protected from the consequences of their misdeeds by their size and the political influence of their principals. Sales incentives of one kind and another are not confined to Quebec and it is often difficult to distinguish legitimate concessions to make a deal from outright bribes. In this case, the allegation of $48 million in bribes and $130 million fraudulently received is impressive in its quantum and does raise at least one eyebrow. But it is unjust and unseemly for media and public opinion to leap to the conclusion that a fine rather than an expensive criminal trial of uncertain outcome is craven and corrupt truckling to the fatcat chums of the Liberal party.

Everybody, especially in such a woolly state of affairs as this, deserves a presumption of absence of guilt

Such an event would not be unprecedented, but it should not be presumed. The theory being bandied about that SNC-Lavalin is being spared because prosecution would bankrupt it is spurious. Companies have to disgorge funds sometimes but they don’t commit crimes; people do, and everybody, especially in such a woolly state of affairs as this, deserves a presumption of absence of guilt. And if executives are fairly judged to have committed crimes, they face the sentences but the company continues in the hands of people with better judgment and ethics. SNC-Lavalin has had its ups and downs, but it is a legitimate Canadian international business success story and should not be summarily castigated as financially and ethically bankrupt on allegations as flimsy and unsourced as these. Nor, as a country, should we be in the business of trying to drive a large and successful company into the hands of the receiver. The receivers are a bigger gang of crooks than any corrupt executives in this country going back to the CPR scandal of 1873. The entire bankruptcy system of this country is an outrage and Wilson-Raybould should have done something about that when she had the chance.

Gerry Butts will be missed by this government. I disagree with many of his policy ideas, especially his irrational faith in renewable energy — both its efficacy and the need for it. He largely carries the can for the McGuinty-Wynne negative Economic Miracle in Ontario that almost bankrupted this splendid jurisdiction. And I assume he has had some hand in the unmitigated pipeline and indigenous peoples policy disasters as well. But he is a capable man and something of a likeable scoundrel, a continuator, to a degree, of the cynical and often humorous competence of the men who performed in comparable roles for former Liberal prime ministers King, St. Laurent, Pearson, and Pierre Trudeau: Jack Pickersgill and Jim Coutts.

It will be hard for the government to spin this one other than damagingly, and whatever Gerry’s policy shortcomings, he is an astute political tactician, taking his cue from David Axelrod and even Sol Alinsky, far from the most wholesome American political influences. Nothing less than an ingenious hard-baller could have kept the ramshackle McGuinty roadshow going at Queen’s Park as long as he did. There is another interpretation of events. Gerry Butts’ political virtuosity presumably remains available to the Liberals this election year. If the government makes it, he can earn and receive much of the credit, because it will certainly not be swept back in on its record. If it is reversed at the polls, he will not be burned on the funeral pyre, and will be able to mount another Mephistophelean effort with Justin’s successor, or even, as Jack Pickersgill did, and Jim Coutts almost did, make the jump to elected politics himself.

If Gerry Butts’ political career ends here, it will be an absurd anti-climax, unless there is a lot more to this than meets even the inquisitive eye. This is a strange, hardly believable, crisis, and it’s hard to see where it’s going. Whatever happens, the country’s sense of humour is unlikely to be disserved.

The SNC-Lavalin matter already sounded like puff pastry when it first appeared and now it is a crumb, a particle. The allegation was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff were concerned less about legal niceties than about huge job losses should SNC-Lavalin be prosecuted over dodgy money in Libya — is there any other kind? — and perhaps lose 10 years of federal contracts. Out of concern for the public good, they may have mentioned this to the justice minister/attorney-general, who can decide, if she chooses, to defer corporate prosecutions.

He spoke without hesitancy, with clarity and candour, about a danger sensed by many Canadians.

Article Continued Below

“I worry about my country right now, I’m deeply concerned about my country right now and its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election and we’re working hard on that. I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination. I’m worried that someone is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.” I too have worried about Trudeau’s town halls being a danger to him. I’d worry about Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s if he had any. Scheer always looks like a man who has just put eyedrops in and is in that blinking transitory state. Pleasant enough, he is easily led into traps laid by the extreme far-right. Why else would he have appeared with the racist yellow vests on Parliament Hill? Wernick, who has served under many prime ministers, abhorred yellow-vest-style remarks by a Saskatchewan senator that would “incite people to drive trucks over people, after what happened in Toronto last summer” simply because they were Liberal. “I worry about the trolling from the vomitorium of social media entering the open media arena,” he said. We do too. Wernick said he most worries about Canadians “losing faith in the institutions of governance in this country” and doubting that Canada is still, as Chrystia Freeland has put it, a rule-of-law country. He then crisply explained the SNC-Lavalin matter. The rule of law is safe, he concluded. The discussions were appropriate and ethical. There is no two-tiered justice. Deferred prosecution agreements can be rationally applied. In other words, there is no there there. I agree. The SNC-Lavalin matter was a media creation in an election year, possibly done inadvertently to gin things up. It became a sly collective patchwork of insinuation. And now that Wernick has explained the complex role of the Deputy Minister of Fisheries, we Canadians can see that it just doesn’t hold up.

Partisan politics

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs called Federal Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer 'future prime minister' at a pro-oil industry rally in Moosomin, Sask. (CBC)

New Brunswick taxpayers paid $5,000 to fly Premier Blaine Higgs and a staffer to Saskatchewan last week to promote pipelines and the energy sector. But during the trip, the premier attended a rally where he endorsed federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as a future prime minister.

As Jacques Poitras reports, Higgs's comments appear at odds with the convention that government-funded trips not be overtly partisan.

""Should I be doing that or not? I've generally said what I believe in and what I think is going to get results,"" Higgs said.

Opposition MLAs criticized the partisan display.

""I don't think taxpayers should pay for any trips that are perceived as partisan for the Conservative party of New Brunswick or even of Canada,"" said Liberal MLA Roger Melanson.

Speaking of pipelines, TransCanada Corp., the company behind the abandoned Energy East proposal, is asking federal regulators for permission to ship natural gas from Western Canada through existing pipelines to Eastern markets, including Atlantic Canada.

People who live in the Bear Island and Lake George area were alarmed by the presence of what was thought to be large drones flying close to their homes for months. The mystery UFOs — they were literally unidentified flying objects — would appear at night, hover low and circle houses and vehicles, residents said.

The machines raised concerns for privacy and questions about enforcing regulations on operating drones.

Well, with the help of the Mounties, we may have gotten to the bottom of the case. They were planes. RCMP confirmed that on at least one occasion the drone was actually a small plane from a flight school.

But not everyone is convinced.

Cannabis Corner

This week in cannabis-related news:

Brian Harriman, CEO and president of NB Liquor and Cannabis NB, has resigned from his post to take the job as chief operating officer of Sundial Growers, a privately held cannabis producer in Calgary.

His resignation comes amid low cannabis sales, employee layoffs, store closures and supply shortages just months after legalization.

In Saint John, the president of Crosby's Molasses announced he's starting a cannabis edibles business. James Crosby says the company, EYG Consumables, has applied for a licence with Health Canada and purchased a property in the McAllister Industrial Park.

Legalized edibles are expected to hit retail shelves later this year.

In St. Stephen, the owner of a proposed aquaponics farm shifted his vision from farming fish and ""leafy green produce"" to, well, another, more potent kind of leafy green produce. Tanner Stewart will use his system to grow cannabis while farming tilapia.

""You're creating an ecosystem essentially,"" Stewart said.

""It's plants and animals living together in an ecosystem providing what they need to each other.""

Climate emergency

What do Vancouver, Halifax and Edmundston have in common? Besides producing celebrities (#RochVoisineForever), the cities have declared a climate emergency.

Mayor Cyrille Simard said the declaration, which calls for accelerating the shift to greener forms of energy, reflects the impact climate change is already having on the community.

""We see the impact on the ground, we see the cost of that,"" he said, pointing to torrential rains, flooding that's worse and more frequent, and invasive species.

He hopes other municipalities will follow.

The flood zone

The spring freshet is just around the corner, and officials, communities and now an insolvency trustee are urging folks to be prepared for another potentially disastrous flood.

In Jemseg, a group of volunteers will be hosting an all-day workshop to discuss ways to prepare for future flooding. The workshop, which starts at 8:30 a.m. Saturday at the Jemseg Lions Centre, will give residents the chance to recognize vulnerable areas of their communities and start thinking up solutions and prepare for another flood event.

The area was devastated last spring when the St. John River and Grand Lake swelled to historic levels.

Are you a waterfront resident? Be sure to read the handy financial advice offered by Kristi Neilsen, a Saint John-based licensed insolvency trustee.

Neilsen touches on creating a financial cushion, insurance providers and tips to ensure you're protected if a flood comes.

In Nauwigewauk, the province is moving ahead with plans to raise the only road onto Darlings Island — a road that's often flooded during the spring freshet.

But, as Connell Smith reports, in December the province purchased a home for $295,000 that was built on the flood-prone road three years earlier with approval from the province.

The cost of cancer

On Dec. 7, Marilyn Steele was told she could die of a rare cancer in three months. Her doctor said surgery wasn't an option in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, so the Nashwaak Bridge woman headed to Florida to undergo the procedure.

She accumulated $144,000 in medical bills, and now her family faces the prospect of selling their house.

""We're not rich people,"" she said. ""We're both retired on a small pension. And the only asset that we have is our home. And it's a very modest three-bedroom bungalow in the country.""

New Brunswick's Remy Leduc may not have won the renowned Yukon Quest, a 1,000-mile dog-sledding race from Whitehorse to Alaska; he was just happy to cross the finish the line.

His efforts during his first Quest earned him the Challenge of the North Award, which is given to the musher who best exemplifies the spirit of the race.

He's already planning for next year's race.

124,Empty,2019-02-23T05:00:00Z,,"This report from Ottawa confirms that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould last September about the ongoing discussions between their government and SNC-Lavalin concerning the disposition of criminal charges against the company.

As your story notes, Trudeau “did not detail the whole conversation.” Why not?

His statement raises a critical unknown: What exactly did Trudeau say to Wilson-Raybould that prompted her question. I find it impossible to believe that her query came out of the blue and was not in response to something Trudeau said to her and that he is now extremely reluctant to repeat.

The story quotes Trudeau as saying, “When she asked me if I was directing her or giving her instructions in relation to this decision (as between a criminal trial or a deferred prosecution agreement) I told her, ‘No, assuredly not. It’s your decision to take.’”

Here’s hoping that the harsh spotlight on Butts’ machiavellian role will discourage any future repetition of allowing unelected appointees to run things behind the scenes in Ottawa.

It seems highly unlikely that those employees would fund such initiatives out of their own pockets. Once again, the key to unravelling sordid affairs of this nature is to follow the money.

The issue is not whether SNC-Lavalin should be prosecuted but what kind of penalty it should face. There are 50,000 jobs at stake here. Is it not the federal government’s role to protect those jobs?

When opposition politicians and other critics take shots at the federal government, hoping to score electoral points with voters, they have forgotten the big picture.

The former attorney general decided not to allow a deferred prosecution agreement, but chose to proceed with criminal prosecution that could lead to the demise of the firm (over a business practice that is illegal in Canada but is a necessary norm in Libya).

Why shouldn’t the PMO not have a right to seek a path where substantial jobs are protected while penalties are still imposed? How does making 50,000 people unemployed serve the nation?

Canadians care about jobs and how the federal government is improving their lives. All these political attacks on the federal government do not advance the needs of Canadians and show how out of touch the opposition politicians are with our needs.

Salmon Lee, Mississauga

First, the company is well-known to be a strong supporter of the Liberal Party. More importantly, the goods the company manufactures in Canada for export ensure a steady flow of money into the federal treasury.

Note that this includes war materials sold, indirectly, to Saudi Arabia. Does this not matter to us?

Alan Craig, Brampton

The job of the AG is a high-pressure one because it is her job to hear all sides in order to make a fair decision that benefits Canadians. The final decision is made by the AG alone.

There is no scandal if the PMO discussed the case or even indicated what outcome the government would prefer. There is only scandal if someone directed or told the AG what the decision had to be. The AG has to be strong, focused and independent enough to withstand pressure from all sides.

Gail Rutherford, Toronto

The only way to change a company’s culture is to punish the company, whose stock then drops. The shareholders then elect a more honest group of directors.

G.H. MacKenzie, Niagara Falls

In the pipeline showdown on Parliament Hill, again, jobs are at stake, but so is the environment.

These are serious dilemmas for all of us to consider and it looks like the opposition is merely looking at how to garner political support during an election year.

Stephen Bloom, Toronto

What we know so far is that Jody Wilson-Rebould as justice minister had “robust discussions” with the PMO regarding the SNC-Lavalin case and, in the end, it appears she leaned in favour of the rule of law.

If indeed the prime minister accepted the decision that he explained was Wilson-Rebould’s to make, why was she demoted? Why demote a minister who was Canada’s first Indigenous justice minister? What was the message being sent, and why?

As for Gerald Butts, his resignation does little to assist the prime minister, as it conjures up more questions than it answers and keeps the story on the front pages. Odd step to take.

125,Empty,2019-02-22T15:49:33Z,"Perhaps there’s a good explanation for her silence (at least in public) over the last three years, but so far, we don't know what it is.","There’s a popular hashtag: #LetJodySpeak. Thousands have signed a petition to have her freed from the shackles of solicitor-client privilege. There are opposition calls verging on a chant to let her account of things be fully revealed. Political cartoonists have (insensitively and ill-advisedly, having missed the memos about #MeToo and MMIW) pictured her bound and gagged.

But here’s a question: Why didn’t former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould speak up publicly last spring — or at any other time during her three-plus years as Canada’s justice minister and attorney general — when the “deferred prosecution” instrument now at the centre of a national political storm was still just a self-serving idea championed by Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, and then became a Liberal government proposal self-servingly slipped into its omnibus bill encompassing the 2018 federal budget?

Let’s dial the clock back to May 2018, when the House of Commons finance committee was debating that controversial mega-bill — the kind of overstuffed legislative package notoriously preferred by the former Conservative government of Stephen Harper, and which a future prime minister, Justin Trudeau, once vowed he would never, ever use because of its inherently anti-democratic nature.

Opposition MPs at the time argued that the DPA provisions should have been examined separately by the justice committee, where Wilson-Raybould might have been available for questioning about a law that prompted even local Quebec Liberal MP Greg Fergus — a member of the finance committee — to state bluntly: “We seem to be letting off people in white-collar crimes with a little slap on the wrist.”

Even local Quebec Liberal MP Greg Fergus — a member of the finance committee — stated bluntly: “We seem to be letting off people in white-collar crimes with a little slap on the wrist.”

That comment came during a brief Q-&-A session between committee members and Ann Sheppard, a senior Department of Justice official. The time pressures involved in approving the budget bill never allowed a proper debate to occur on deferred prosecutions, which allow for decisions in which companies charged with corruption pay a big fine, avoid a messy court case and — crucially — remain eligible for future federal contracts.

A Senate committee reviewing the budget did manage to arrange special sessions on the proposed DPA measures — but Wilson-Raybould ignored requests to appear.

“It’s very unusual to study a bill, especially in the criminal domain, and to not have the minister responsible appear before the committee,” Conservative Sen. Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu stated at the time. Recalling Wilson-Raybould’s absence from those May 2018 hearings, Independent Liberal Sen. Serge Joyal told the Canadian Press last week: “Now, of course, in retrospect … I can understand that she might not have been at ease with the overall issue of remediation (DPA) agreements and didn’t want to submit herself to questions in relation to that.”

So the budget bill — including the DPA provisions — was passed by Parliament in June without a public word from Wilson-Raybould.

But let’s dial the clock back even further to November 2015, just a month after the election victory that brought the Trudeau Liberals to power. That’s when The Globe and Mail first reported on the proposed DPA concept for Canada under the telling headline: “SNC-Lavalin seeks corruption settlement with Ottawa.”

The story rightly observed that the company’s bid to avoid prosecution would be politically challenging for a new government also committed to battling corruption: “It could be a key early file for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Minister of Justice, Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

But before the Globe broke the story this month about Wilson-Raybould feeling pressured to offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution deal, only one other news story over the past four years linked her directly with the DPA issue: a May 2018 Canadian Press article in which a Wilson-Raybould spokesman — not the minister herself — explained certain benefits of the planned legislation.

David Taylor told CP at the time that the agreements “are a way of holding corporations accountable while protecting ‘innocent third parties’ such as those who stand to lose jobs, pensions or investments in the event of criminal sanction.”

Still, Wilson-Raybould’s own views appear to be absent from the public record during the years when SNC-Lavalin was lobbying — relentlessly and eventually successfully — for the creation of a no-prosecution alternative to corporate corruption trials.

A search of the Hansard parliamentary archive reveals no discussion of DPAs by the former minister. And a record of public consultations in 2017 on proposed changes to Canada’s “Integrity Regime” — including the introduction of DPAs and other measures aimed at “expanding Canada’s toolkit to address corporate wrongdoing” — makes no mention of input from Wilson-Raybould.

Perhaps there’s a good explanation for her silence (at least in public) over that period, during three years of aggressive SNC-Lavalin advocacy and many months of Liberal law-drafting and budget-making. Perhaps it’s Joyal’s explanation, but we just don’t know.

All that happened long before Wilson-Raybould’s now-contentious discussions last autumn with Trudeau, then-PMO chief Gerald Butts, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and others — the talks about which the ex-minister has been forced to remain, so far, infamously mute.

On the surface, though, it’s hard to square the noble mission Wilson-Raybould recently said she had assigned herself as justice minister and attorney general — to pursue a path of “principled independence,” to safeguard a justice system “free from even the perception of political interference,” to be “non-partisan” and “always willing to speak truth to power” — with her strangely tight-lipped approach to a DPA law drafted by her government at the bidding of SNC-Lavalin, once a marquee donor to the Liberal party.

We all know now how important this piece of legislation was for the Trudeau government. The prime minister and his officials evidently pushed hard enough to risk a damaging break with the justice minister — a high-profile Indigenous woman widely viewed as a cabinet superstar — over trying to offer a DPA to SNC-Lavalin even after prosecutors had balked at the idea.

We all know now how important this piece of legislation was for the Trudeau government. The prime minister and his officials evidently pushed hard enough to risk a damaging break with the justice minister — a high-profile Indigenous woman widely viewed as a cabinet superstar.

So what does “speaking truth to power” mean when you actually are a key part of the power — as the federal minister of justice and attorney general — that oversees the creation of new laws? Apparently for Wilson-Raybould, in terms of shaping and adopting the DPA legislation, it meant saying nothing out loud.

The frustrating silence of Wilson-Raybould about later events remains the most pressing political issue in the country right now. Trudeau wondered aloud last week (insensitively and ill-advisedly, according to some critics) why Wilson-Raybould hadn’t spoken to him last fall if she’d felt bullied by the PMO to go easy on SNC-Lavalin.

She now seems anxious to unburden herself of some troubling truths — she’s expected to appear before the House of Commons justice committee next week — but it’s still unclear how much she’ll be able to say or will choose to say about certain conversations.

What’s remarkable in the wake of this scandal is that average Canadians are only now engaged — a year too late — in a vigorous debate about the merits and pitfalls of the legislation that made it possible for federal prosecutors to even consider pursuing a DPA with SNC-Lavalin.

So in addition to getting answers about the political pressure Wilson-Raybould felt last fall over the SNC-Lavalin case, the justice committee should inquire about why she was so quiet for years about the deferred prosecution proposal that would eventually explode in this month’s crisis.

The comment was part of a message to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos after he and his company pulled out of a deal to have a headquarters in Queens in New York City.

He said the company now had a chance to 'actually do good' and help out areas of the country that are less prosperous.

In the closing remarks of his HBO show on Friday night, Maher compared Bezos to Bugsy Siegel, remarking that if the mobster built Las Vegas in the midst of a desert, then Amazon could do the same by turning Nebraska 'into the next Silicon Valley'.

'We have a problem in America called spatial geographic inequality which means the most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities,' Maher said.

Real Time host Bill Maher said the 'most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities', referring to those in blue states, in the closing remarks of his Friday show

He then went on to mention a comment made by Hillary Clinton about how she 'won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product' in the 2016 presidential election.

Maher then shows a map where the majority of Middle America is in red while the coasts are heavy in blue, indicating where the plurality voted Democrat or Republican.

'The blue parts of America are having a prosperity party while that big sea of red feels like their invitation got lost in the mail,' Maher said.

He then goes on to say there are clearly 'two Americas'.

'We have orchestras and theaters districts and world-class shopping. We have Chef Wolfgang Puck, they have Chef Boyardee,' Maher said.

'Our roofs have solar panels. Theirs has last year's Christmas lights.'

The late-night host said Middle America, or 'the passed-over states', are not just angry - they're 'pissed off'.

'They don't hate us, they want to be us,' Maher said.

Maher also accused Amazon of 'playing cities off against one another' during its bidding process for new headquarters.

After 238 cities and regions submitted proposal, Amazon chose New York City and Arlington, Virginia, which is suburban Washington, DC.

'And Amazon picked two places that didn't need them at all, places where prosperity already was. Bezos you're worth 130 billion,' Maher said.

'Take one for the team. Stop playing cities off against one another and help a dying one come back to life!'

Maher (left in December 2018 and right in August 2017) then goes on to say there are clearly 'two Americas', one where there is 'Chef Wolfgang Puck' and another when there is 'Chef Boyardee'

On February 14, Amazon abruptly dropped plans Thursday for a big new headquarters in New York that would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city.

Several politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised to what is already one of the world's richest, most powerful companies.

'We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion - we love New York,' the online giant from Seattle said in a blog post announcing its withdrawal.

The stunning move was a serious blow to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had lobbied intensely to land the project.

New York City competed against more than 200 other metropolitan areas across the continent that were practically tripping over each other to offer incentives to Amazon in a bidding war the company stoked.

Cuomo lashed out at fellow New York politicians over Amazon's change of heart, saying the project would have helped diversify the city's economy, cement its status as an emerging tech hub and generate money for schools, housing and transit.

'A small group (of) politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community,' he said.

But Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City's new liberal firebrand, exulted over Amazon's pullout.

'Today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,' she tweeted, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

In pulling out, Amazon said it isn't looking for a replacement location 'at this time.' It said it plans to spread the technology jobs that were slated for New York to other offices around the U.S. and Canada, including Chicago, Toronto and Austin, Texas.

It will also expand its existing New York offices, which already have about 5,000 employees.",Bill Maher makes fun of Americans living in red states saying they are less 'affluent and educated',Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6739677/Bill-Maher-makes-fun-Americans-living-red-states-saying-affluent-educated.html

As you click on the tab that reads Play Game, you are welcomed by a screen that has a list of countries. Every country has a detailed chart with information on population, life expectancy, gross domestic product, per capita income and so on and so forth. After you pick your country, you get to name your political party and choose the length and limits of your term of office.

Democracy III is one of the 16 interactive video games that are on display at the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan. This is part of Global Games: Games And Politics, an ongoing exhibition of political video games created since 2004 and developed by the Goethe-Institut and the Germany-based ZKM (Center for Art and Media).

The huge hall at the Goethe-Institut is lined with monitors. Each monitor has a silver balloon perched atop; it lends a futuristic touch, very Star Trek. One can see the occasional figure bent over a monitor, headphones in place, clicking away. I pick a country, Canada, and a message flashes on the screen: “Congratulations! Welcome to your new job as Prime Minister. The lives of all 3,34,76,000 citizens are now in your hands.”

There are tabs titled GDP, Poverty, Health, Education, Unemployment, Crime. Alter any one and the change impacts the rest. One also gets to pick from a list of natural calamities during one’s tenure — hurricanes, earthquakes. Crime, unemployment, national debt, terrorism, climate change are other heads that appear onscreen as the game progresses. Detailed data tables, diagrams and trend indicators are available at a click to aid decision-making.

There are 21 categories of citizens listed under a country — farmers, industrialists, liberalists, capitalists, the youth and the retired, to name a few. Every decision is applauded by some and rejected by others — indicated by colour codes — and you realise you can never please all the people. The goal could be either to get re-elected or to turn your country from a liberal to a conservative state.

Into the first 10 minutes of my term as Prime Minister of Canada, I tighten the environmental laws and increase fines for violators. The effect on the environment is positive, but the GDP plummets. The next thing I know is that the number of unemployed people is rising, and thereon all starts to go haywire.

According to Friso Maecker, the director of Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta, he had wanted to host an art exhibition that would be “relevant” across age groups. He says, “Video games are played by all age groups. They have entered peoples’ living rooms and are not hushed away into a dark corner anymore.

So this exhibition deals with a medium that many people use in their everyday lives.”

Speaking of relevance, the game Orwell begins with a blast. The context of the game: on April 12, 2017, a bomb explodes in the populated Freedom Plaza in Bonton, Germany, destroying an important statue and killing several people. A note containing the first three stanzas of the German folk song Die Gedanken sind frei or The Thoughts are Free is found at the site. Present at the Plaza shortly before the explosion was Cassandra Watergate, an artist who was arrested for assaulting a police officer at a protest some weeks ago. As a player, I have to investigate the case; it involves surveillance. As the game unfolds, it penetrates the most private aspects of citizens’ lives — their surfing habits, call details, where they shop, who they socialise with, their personal milestones.

Maecker suggests that the experiential nature of the games might move individuals to an informed understanding of the world they are living in. He says, “It is the nature of the video game that it tries to blur the lines between real and fiction. While playing, one needs to take decisions for the character one becomes in the game, thus experiencing and understanding a whole range of political systems.”

The 2016 game Yellow Umbrella recreates blockades complete with tear gas-wielding police, thugs, a politician and regular citizens. Unmanned, which is from 2012, is about the effects of drone warfare from a pilot’s perspective. And then there is This War of Mine, a war game that shows the consequences of armed conflict through a civilian’s experience. It was developed in 2014.

Not every game has to do with the politics of the state, there are those that explore gender politics too. A student of Loreto College, Illanjana Bhadra, has played two games — Coming Out Stimulator and Dys4ia. While the first chronicles the challenges an individual faces after having decided to come out, the second plays out a narrative about a person going through sex change. Bhadra hopes such gender sensitive games will foster a spirit of empathy and inclusiveness.

128,Empty,2019-02-22T17:40:18Z,NEB says Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in public interest despite ‘adverse’ impact on whale population theglobeandmail.com,"The National Energy Board recommended on Friday that the federal government approve for a second time the long-stalled Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, despite the fact it would likely have “significant adverse” impacts on endangered killer whales and the Indigenous communities in British Columbia that revere them.

In its 700-page report, the energy regulator said the expansion of the crude oil pipeline would be in the public interest by creating a diverse market for Western Canadian oil producers; spurring job creation and economic development for local and Indigenous communities, and enhancing revenues for governments. While the benefits would be largely national and regional in scope, the environmental risks will largely be borne by local communities, including First Nations, the board noted.

The federal government will continue its consultations with First Nations to determine what precise concerns affected communities have about the project, and how their views can be accommodated. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa will aim to conclude its consultations and make a decision by June.

Despite negative impacts, “the NEB recommends that the government of Canada finds that they can be justified in the circumstances in light of the considerable benefits of the projects and measures to mitigate the effects,” the board’s chief environment officer, Robert Steedman, told a Friday news conference in Calgary. The board set out 156 conditions the pipeline proponent – now the federal government – would have to meet, while making 16 recommendations to Ottawa for measures that would limit the impact of increased ship traffic in the Salish Sea and help restore the already-polluted, heavily travelled waterway.

The pipeline expansion plan has provoked inter-provincial feuding, oil-industry rage and fears among activists and some First Nations communities over threats to the environment and marine species. The government of Alberta and the oil industry maintain the Trans Mountain project is a crucial economic lifeline to expand crude exports and relieve the frequent price pressure on Western Canadian crude that results from insufficient pipeline capacity. Environmental activists decried the NEB’s conclusion, saying it is clear the pipeline will cause further damage to the orcas in the Salish Sea and would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the oil industry.

Ottawa’s 2016 approval of the pipeline expansion was quashed last August when a Federal Court of Appeal judge found the government’s First Nations consultations had been inadequate and that the NEB did not properly consider the impacts of increased marine traffic.

However, the project was in trouble even before the court decision. Faced with opposition from the government of British Columbia, Indigenous leaders, and environmental groups, former owner Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd., announced last April that it was halting construction.

In late May, the Liberal government announced it would purchase the existing Trans Mountain pipeline and terminal for $4.5-billion and finance the expansion project until it could eliminate much of the political and legal risk and resell it to the private sector. Some First Nations leaders in Alberta and B.C. have expressed an interest in purchasing a stake in the pipeline project, a notion the Liberal government supports.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the NEB’s revised conditions and additional recommendations were sound, though she cautioned that Friday’s report isn’t the end of the process. Specifically, she acknowledged that the project could still face more court challenges and protests.

“Many obstacles have been put in our way, and quite clearly we are not done yet,” she told reporters in Calgary.

Ms. Notley said that once the federal cabinet makes its decision, which she expects before the federal election, construction would likely resume very quickly. In the meantime, she said she’ll be pressing the federal government to ensure consultations with First Nations are adequate so a new federal approval won’t be derailed by another court challenge.

British Columbia’s Environment Minister, George Heyman, said he was disappointed at the NEB’s ruling. “They found there would be significant impacts on southern resident killer whales, [and] that there would be a catastrophic impact if there was a spill,"" he said. ""And they reached the conclusion, astoundingly, that no new conditions were needed.” He vowed B.C. will continue with legal reference case that will test the constitutional limits of the province’s authority to restrict the flow of oil crossing its borders.

Indigenous leaders opposed to the pipeline project said Friday the board’s report does nothing to allay their concerns about risks to the salmon and killer whales. And they vow to pursue further legal challenges if Ottawa approves it again.

“We have a reciprocal and loving and spiritual relationship with the lands and the water and the things on it like the salmon and the whales,” said Rueben George, of the Tsleil Waututh First Nation, which was part of the legal challenge that quashed the first permit. “We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the things that we love, because no price can be put on the sacred.”

The allegation is contained in a lawsuit filed by Vivian Bercovici, a former Canadian ambassador to Israel, who was appointed by the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper and subsequently fired by the Trudeau Liberals.

Bercovici alleges she was terminated without being properly compensated for pension benefits, and that the government abused and harassed her.

On Monday, her lawyer will petition the Ontario Court of Justice to amend the lawsuit to have Telford and four senior officials of Global Affairs Canada added as defendants.

The allegations have not been proven in court, and the Prime Minister's Office did not respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department says in a reply filed in court last month that Bercovici's ""bold allegations"" should be dismissed.

Bercovici has been a source of controversy since Harper appointed her as his envoy to Israel in 2014. She was not a career diplomat — which is not unusual for high-profile ambassadorial appointments — but she faced internal opposition within the foreign ministry for being too pro-Israel. Bercovici is Jewish and a self-described supporter of Israel.

The Harper Conservatives faced frequent criticism that they were too pro-Israel in their Middle East stance, and vigorously rejected the long-held notion in Canadian diplomacy that Ottawa should see itself as an ""honest broker"" in the conflict between the Jewish state and the Palestinians.

'Unwelcomed' by bureaucracy

Bercovici's lawsuit alleges she was unwelcomed by the bureaucracy from the moment she was appointed. She was ""not only unsupported in her role, but the individual named Defendants as well as countless others within the Public Service, intentionally and maliciously waged a campaign of abuse"" against her.

After the Liberals fired her in mid-2016 — as they were entitled to do — Bercovici alleges the government withheld almost $32,000 in pension benefits. She is suing for that amount, as well as millions of dollars in punitive and moral damages.

Bercovici's lawsuit alleges that she reached out to Telford repeatedly through emails and phone calls to deal with her pension issue, but was ignored each time.

In her lawsuit, she is seeking $250,000 in damages from Telford for the ""intentional affliction of mental suffering.""

Telford, 4 officials named as defendants

The motion to add Telford and four senior Global Affairs Canada officials as defendants was filed in December and is to be argued in a Toronto court on Monday.

On Jan. 9, the Justice Department filed its reply with the court, arguing that there was no merit to adding five new defendants to the lawsuit.

""The Plaintiff's claims against the proposed individuals is frivolous and discloses no reasonable cause of action,"" says the factum filed by the Justice Department.

""The allegations made by the Plaintiff do not rise to the level of 'flagrant and outrageous' conduct. The Plaintiff has failed to plead any material facts to support her allegations of being 'sidelined,' 'threatened,' 'undermined' or suffering 'personal attacks.' The Plaintiff makes bold allegations that are devoid of any particulars.""

The long-simmering legal drama is unfolding as the Prime Minister's Office grapples with the resignation of Butts, who served as Trudeau's principal secretary and most trusted adviser.

Butts denied any impropriety, but said he was becoming a distraction to the government amid allegations that unnamed officials in the Prime Minister's Office put undue pressure on the former attorney general in a case involving engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Architects of Trudeau victory

Butts and Telford were the architects of Trudeau's rise to the Liberal party leadership and his subsequent 2015 election victory.

Natalie MacDonald, Bercovici's lawyer, suggested the current controversy enveloping the Prime Minister's Office has resonance for her client.

""We have pleaded that Katie Telford, a central figure in the PMO, purposely ignored repeated requests for immediate assistance and intervention with respect to the government's unconscionable withholding of Ms. Bercovici's pension monies,"" MacDonald told The Canadian Press.

""Our client was given no choice but to sue.

OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be pressured Monday to testify at a House of Commons committee looking into allegations the prime minister and his staff pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Conservative party will introduce a motion arguing that since Trudeau keeps saying the Commons justice committee is well placed to investigate the allegations, he should have no problem showing up there himself to answer questions about his role in the matter.

The motion will ask all MPs to vote to call Trudeau before the committee for at least two hours, by March 15.

Motions in the House of Commons are not binding and regardless of the outcome, the committee itself would still have to decide whether to invite Trudeau. Besides that, MPs, including the prime minister, cannot be forced to appear before committees.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Friday the committee has already heard from the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, that ""Justin Trudeau had his fingerprints all over this.""

Wernick told the committee Thursday that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould, who quit the cabinet last week, and that Trudeau's staff have conducted themselves with ""the highest standards of integrity.""

He said that Trudeau was worried a prosecution might result in SNC-Lavalin's moving its operations overseas or closing up shop, hurting innocent employees, shareholders, pensioners, third-party suppliers and communities in which the company operates. Wernick said he told Wilson-Raybould about those concerns during a conversation in December but that his intention was to provide ""context,"" not pressure.

He also said the prime minister assured Wilson-Raybould at every opportunity that a decision on whether to halt the prosecution was hers alone.

Trudeau said Wernick's words should carry weight with Canadians.

""The clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, is an extraordinary public servant who has served this country and continues to serve this country under governments of different political stripes, with integrity and brilliance,"" said Trudeau. ""He is someone we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly and I'm sure everyone is taking a careful look at his words yesterday.""

But Scheer said Wernick's testimony laid bare just how many times Trudeau, members of his political staff, and Wernick spoke to Wilson-Raybould in an attempt to change her mind and allow SNC-Lavalin to enter into a remediation agreement rather than go on trial for fraud and bribery related to the firm's work in Libya.

Scheer dismissed Wernick's assertion that those conversations were within bounds.

""It's all well and good for someone who is trying to defend his own actions and defend the actions of the government to come to that conclusion,"" said Scheer.

Some opposition MPs and pundits have suggested Wernick crossed into partisanship by defending the government. Scheer wouldn't go that far but he did seem surprised by what Wernick said.

""I had certainly not seen a performance like that in the past,"" said Scheer.

Trudeau's government has been rocked by the anonymous allegations that Wilson-Raybould was under pressure from the Prime Minister's Office to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin -- a kind of plea bargain that would force the company to pay restitution but would spare it a criminal conviction that could cripple it by barring it from bidding on government contracts for up to 10 years.

Also on Friday, SNC-Lavalin chief executive Neil Bruce lashed out over the pummelling the company is taking from politicians.

""Frankly, we've had enough of all that, and we're just going to vigorously defend ourselves in court, and that's our strategy,"" he said.

Bruce said the Public Prosecution Service of Canada can still invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a remediation agreement and the company would be willing to do so.

""But frankly, it doesn't look like that today,"" he said.

Trudeau was not as eager to heed Wernick's opinion on solicitor-client privilege, the principle Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly cited to refuse comment on the allegations that she was improperly pressured. The clerk told the committee he doesn't think solicitor-client privilege applies in this instance and it's up to Wilson-Raybould to choose how much she wants to say on the matter when she appears before the committee next week.

Trudeau said he is still receiving advice on whether to waive the bond of secrecy between lawyer and client because there are potential consequences for two ongoing court cases against the company.

Scheer accused Trudeau of ""cherry picking"" which parts of Wernick's testimony he wants to listen to.

Trudeau is seeking advice on the privilege matter from David Lametti, whom he appointed justice minister and attorney general in an early January cabinet shuffle in which he moved Wilson-Raybould to the veterans-affairs post.

Under opposition demands Friday to explain why solicitor-client privilege has not been waived, Lametti told the Commons it's an exceptionally complex issue but he's doing his ""level best"" to find a way ""such that the former attorney general can, in fact, speak.""

New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh arrives for a caucus meeting in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Wattie

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The struggling head of Canada's left-leaning New Democrats, an opposition party that competes with the Liberals of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will try to win a parliamentary seat on Monday amid speculation he could be ousted if he loses.

Jagmeet Singh, a practicing Sikh, made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau's chances become.

Singh is contesting a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Results should become available at around 11 p.m. Eastern (0400 GMT Tuesday).

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

In unusually frank remarks, Mulcair said last month that ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if he lost on Monday.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau's office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

WHITE HOUSE PALACE INTRIGUE -- “Officials Play Down Appearance of Rift Between Trump and Lighthizer on Trade,” by WSJ’s Bob Davis: “U.S. trade officials are looking to knock down speculation of a split on China policy between President Trump and his lead trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, following a testy exchange between the two in the Oval Office Friday.

“The incident occurred in front of reporters Friday afternoon, as the president and cabinet officials met with China’s top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, to announce that talks aimed at settling the U.S.-China trade dispute were making progress and would be extended through the weekend.

“Mr. Trump appeared to upbraid Mr. Lighthizer, who said he was negotiating memorandums of understanding with China. The MOUs cover a half-dozen subjects including agriculture, currency policy and technology transfer. ‘An MOU is a contract,’ Mr. Lighthizer said, turning to reporters. ‘A memorandum of understanding is a binding agreement between two people. And that’s what we’re talking about.’ That provoked what many saw as a rebuke from the president.” WSJ

-- WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA: “‘No rush’: Trump redefines success ahead of second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un”: “Days ahead of his second summit with Kim Jong Un, President Trump is redefining success in his bid to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear program, tamping down public expectations amid evidence that Pyongyang has done little to curb its weapons production. Trump is hopeful that his bilateral meetings with Kim this week in Hanoi will re-create the international media spectacle of their historic first summit in Singapore last summer — and perhaps distract from mounting domestic political turmoil.

“But wide gaps remain between U.S. and North Korean negotiators, who have yet to agree on a basic definition of what ‘denuclearization’ means to both sides, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. Senior Trump aides have privately expressed skepticism over the prospects that a deal can be reached to significantly advance the largely symbolic agreement announced in Singapore.

“Some fear that Trump could feel pressure to make a major concession to Kim during face-to-face talks, including a one-on-one session, in hopes of securing a reciprocal commitment he can herald as a political victory.

“In recent days, Trump has sought to create the conditions to declare the summit a success regardless of the outcome. Having once demanded that the North give up its weapons quickly, Trump said last week he is in ‘no rush’ as long as the regime maintains a testing moratorium on nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles that has been in place since November 2017. ‘I have no pressing timetable,’ he said, adding that he expects his meeting with Kim in Hanoi won’t be their last.” WaPo

But in the filing submitted Friday and made partially public Saturday, they recommended no specific punishment for those crimes, saying that is the practice of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose office brought the case. Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort’s guilty plea in his D.C. case, the maximum he faces behind bars is 10.

“The special counsel team said it may ask for Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that runs after any prison time Manafort is given for related crimes in Virginia federal court. ‘Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law’” prosecutors said, from ‘garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud’ to ‘more esoteric laws’ involving foreign lobbying. He lied, they noted, ‘to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel’s Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government.’” WaPo ...

HOW ABOUT THAT … “In Latest Shift, Trump Agrees to Leave 400 Troops in Syria,” by NYT’s Mark Landler and Helene Cooper: “First, President Trump was going to pull all 2,000 American troops out of Syria immediately. Then he was going to slow down the withdrawal. Then he was going to leave troops in neighboring Iraq. Now, in the latest about-face, Mr. Trump has agreed to leave about 400 troops in Syria — 200 in a multinational force in the northeastern part of the country and another 200 at a small outpost in the southeast, where they will seek to counter Iran’s influence throughout the country.

“His decision to commit what one senior administration official described on Friday as a ‘couple hundred troops’ to the multinational force, operating south of the Turkish border, came after European allies refused to send troops if the United States would not. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, pressed the president to make the decision on Thursday, this official said, amid signs that the Pentagon’s negotiations to put together a stabilization and monitoring force were foundering on European resistance.” NYT

US presidents have bombed or invaded places like Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Sudan to distract from domestic scandals or to gain a quick boost in popularity. But, do Canadian politicians also pursue regime change abroad to be cheered on by the dominant media as decisive leaders?

In a discussion on regime change in Venezuela after last Monday’s “Lima Group” meeting in Ottawa, Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O’Toole praised Canadian policy but added that the Liberals used the meeting of countries opposed to Nicolas Maduro’s government to drown out criticism of their foreign policy. O’Toole claimed the “Lima Group” meeting was “put together quite quickly and I think there are some politics behind that with some of the foreign affairs challenges the Trudeau government has been having in recent months.” In other words, O’Toole believes the Liberals organized a gathering that concluded with a call for the military to oust Venezuela’s elected president to appear like effective international players.

Understood within the broader corporate and geopolitical context, O’Toole’s assessment appears reasonable. After being criticized for its China policy, the Liberals have been widely praised for their regime change efforts in Venezuela. In a sign of media cheerleading, CTV News host Don Martin began his post “Lima Group” interview with foreign minister Chrystia Freeland by stating “the Lima summit has wrapped and the object of regime change is staying put for the time being” and then he asked her “is [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro any step closer to being kicked out of office as a result of this meeting today?” Later in the interview Martin applauded the “Lima Group’s” bid “to put the economic pincers around it [Venezuela’s economy] and choking it off from international transactions.”

In recent days Ben Rowswell, a former Canadian ambassador in Caracas, has been widely quoted praising the Liberals’ leadership on Venezuela. “It’s clear that the international community is paying attention to what Canada has to say about human rights and democracy,” Rowswell was quoted as saying in an article titled “Trudeau’s Venezuela diplomacy is a bright spot amid China furor”.

Rowswell heads the Canadian International Council, which seeks to “integrate business leaders with the best researchers and public policy leaders”, according to its billionaire financier Jim Balsillie. Long an influential voice on foreign policy, CIC hosted the above-mentioned forum with O’Toole that also included the Liberal’s junior foreign minister Andrew Leslie and NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière. CIC’s post “Lima Group” meeting forum was co-sponsored with the Canadian Council of the Americas, which is led by Kinross, Kinross, ScotiaBank, KPMG and SNC Lavalin. On the day of the “Lima Group” meeting CCA head Ken Frankel published an op-ed in the Globe and Mail headlined “Venezuela crisis will be a true test of Canada’s leadership in the hemisphere.” Frankel told CPAC he was “always supportive of Canadian leadership in the Hemisphere” and “the Venezuela situation has presented … a perfect opportunity for the Trudeau government to showcase the principles of its foreign policy.”

At the CCA/CIC forum Laverdière made it clear there’s little official political opposition to Ottawa’s regime change efforts. The NDP’s foreign critic agreed with Canada’s recognition of Juan Guaidó as president of Venezuela, as she did on Twitter, at a press scrum and on CPAC during the day of the “Lima Group” meeting in Ottawa. (Amidst criticism from NDP activists, party leader Jagmeet Singh later equivocated on explicitly recognizing Guaidó.)

With the NDP, Conservatives, CIC, CCA, most media, etc. supporting regime change in Venezuela, there is little downside for the Liberals to push an issue they believe boosts their international brand. To get a sense of their brashness, the day of the “Lima Group” meeting the iconic CN Tower in Toronto was lit up with the colours of the Venezuelan flag. A tweet from Global Affairs Canada explained, “As the sun sets on today’s historic Lima Group meeting, Venezuela’s colours shine bright on Canada’s CN Tower to show our support for the people of Venezuela and their fight for democracy.”

The Liberals drive for regime change in Venezuela to mask other foreign-policy problem is reminiscent of Stephen Harper’s push to bomb Libya. Facing criticism for weakening Canada’s moral reputation and failing to win a seat on the UN Security Council, a Canadian general oversaw NATO’s war, seven CF-18s participated in bombing runs and two Royal Canadian Navy vessels patrolled Libya’s coast.

The mission, which began six weeks before the 2011 federal election, may have helped the Conservatives win a majority government. At the time Postmedia published a story titled “Libya ‘photo op’ gives Harper advantage: experts” and Toronto Star columnist Thomas Walkom published a commentary titled “Libyan war could be a winner for Harper”. He wrote: “War fits with the Conservative storyline of Harper as a strong, decisive leader. War against a notorious villain contradicts opposition charges of Conservative moral bankruptcy. The inevitable media stories of brave Canadian pilots and grateful Libyan rebels can only distract attention from the Conservative government’s real failings.”

Similar to Venezuela today, the regime change effort in Libya was unanimously endorsed in Parliament (three months into the bombing campaign Green Party MP Elizabeth May voted against a second resolution endorsing a continuation of the war). “It’s appropriate for Canada to be a part of this effort to try to stop Gadhafi from attacking his citizens as he has been threatening to do,’’ said NDP leader Jack Layton. After Moammar Gaddafi was savagely killed six months later, NDP interim leader Nycole Turmel released a statement noting, “the future of Libya now belongs to all Libyans. Our troops have done a wonderful job in Libya over the past few months.”

Emboldened by the opposition parties, the Conservatives organized a nationally televised post-war celebration for Canada’s “military heroes”, which included flyovers from a dozen military aircraft. Calling it “a day of honour”, Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the 300 military personnel brought in from four bases: “We are celebrating a great military success.”

Today Libya is, of course, a disaster. It is still divided into various warring factions and hundreds of militias operate in the country of six million.

But who in Canada ever paid a political price for the destruction of that country and resulting destabilization of much of the Sahel region of Africa?

A similar scenario could develop in Venezuela. Canadian politicians’ push for the military to remove the president could easily slide into civil war and pave the way to a foreign invasion that leads to a humanitarian calamity. If that happened, Canadian politicians, as in Libya, would simply wash their hands of the intervention.

138,Empty,2019-02-24T15:27:18Z,"Historically, successful Black Canadian politicians have operated as quiet leaders and shy elitists.","In 1971, the Yale professor Robin Winks wrote that Black Canadians wanted “nothing more than to be accepted as quiet Canadians.”

In The Blacks in Canada, Winks claimed that Black Canadians were “unlikely to organize militant, noisy, pushy protests.” He considered Daniel Hill, the first full-time director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission in 1962, to be an exemplary model of quiet leadership.

Hill returned the compliment by praising Winks’ history of Blacks in Canada as a powerful tool in his campaigns against serious discrimination in housing, education and employment. Hill’s study of human rights in Canada for the Canadian Labour Congress in 1977 also denounced “aspiring leaders” in militant organizations who did not propose what he considered to be constructive action.

Yet whereas Winks was a rather unabashed elitist who had little time for “simple minds,” Hill translated the work he gleaned from “obscure historical journals” into popular histories. He would work closely with his friend Alan Borovoy, the longtime general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, who defined his anti-racist campaigns against “ineffectual intellectuals with no concept of action.”

Hill and Borovoy may be described as Canadian “shy elitists.” They were uncomfortable with anything that they considered too elitist or radical for Canadian tastes. Yet they also encouraged the public to celebrate and defer to prominent, “respectable” figures in elite institutions.

Since we have not ended our dependence on shy elitism, there remains an understandable interest in celebrating Black men and women who have achieved recognition from the Canadian state.

Canada Post

However, we also need to recognize that Black Canadians are not problems when they do not conform to the model of a quiet leader. They are people who confront the problem of shy elitism in Canada.

Consider some of the challenges faced by the politician, social worker, human rights advocate and academic Rosemary Brown.

Introducing Rosemary Brown

Rosemary Brown moved to Canada in 1951 from Jamaica to study social work at McGill University. She became the first Black woman elected to a provincial legislature in Canada in 1972 and the first Black person to run for leadership of a federal political party in 1975.

(CP PHOTO/Ryan Remiorz)

Featured in a profile in the Toronto Star on Jan. 9, 1973, Brown was introduced as a “McGill University graduate, wife of Vancouver psychiatrist and mother of two.” Aside from the sexism of highlighting her marital and parental status, such descriptive remarks reminded Canadian readers that Brown was educated at McGill, an institution known for training young people to become the next generation of quiet Canadian leaders.

In other words, Brown was portrayed as a solid, respectable member of the middle class who defied North American stereotypes of Black cultural pathology and single mothers raising children outside of nuclear families.

Brown responded to these media profiles by pointing to her upbringing in Jamaica in the 1930s and ‘40s. Unlike Blacks in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, she could claim that she grew up in an environment in which the “governor was Black, judges were Black, the police were Black, anyone who was anyone was Black.”

Exoticizing Rosemary Brown

In the British Columbia legislature, politicians like Pat Jordan, the conservative-populist Social Credit Party MLA, asked why Brown did not move back to Jamaica to solve its problems of “slave labour and poverty.”

Media profiles questioned Brown’s socialist credentials by pointing to her comfortable upbringing and privileged status in Jamaica. Stories in The Vancouver Sun highlighted her expensive home in the fashionable Point Grey area and her Parisian wardrobe. Chatelaine magazine depicted Brown as “deliciously minority and yet so chic.”

Brown’s dismissal of these sneers about radical chic did not go unnoticed by Canadian commentators. Journalist Allan Fotheringham identified a certain haughtiness in Brown’s public demeanour. Bob Hunter, the public intellectual, eco-theorist and founder of Greenpeace, said that Brown had to pass through hoops that were understandably frustrating to someone with her intelligence and potential to become Canada’s “Philosopher Queen.”

Domesticating Rosemary Brown

In her autobiography, Brown conceded that she increasingly felt the need to communicate her message in the “safest, most acceptable and bland” terms to the Canadian voter.

(CP PHOTO/Tom Hanson)

This did not mean that she shied away from controversial issues. It did mean, however, that her campaign to become the federal leader of Canada’s left-leaning New Democratic Party would repeat Canadian platitudes. It was claimed, for example, that the candidacy of a Jamaican-born feminist offered voters an opportunity to live up to Canada’s claim to be a multicultural “nation of immigrants.”

Brown also stressed that responsible, quiet human rights organizations had “more lasting impact on the quality of life” of Black Canadians than more prominent or newsworthy radical organizations.

Although she would not win the NDP leadership, Brown would emerge from the contest with a national profile as a dynamic speaker who could convey the realities of racism and sexism in a manner that was palatable to “ordinary, fair-minded Canadians.”

Brown was increasingly portrayed in the media as a responsible Canadian who encouraged minorities and women to achieve major social change by working inside formal institutions.

Unsettling shy elitism

Brown upheld the legacy of Daniel Hill as chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Agency between 1993 and 1996. She also became an Officer in the Order of Canada in 1996 after she lamented the failure of academics and critical theorists to do anything that might appear “commercialized, common or ordinary.”

Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose?

To unsettle the system of shy elitism in Canada, we need to contest oversimplified solutions to the so-called problem of Blackness in Canada.

We buy prepared meals instead of assembling and cooking the ingredients ourselves. We shop in malls rather than driving to four or five individual stores. We recognize our time is valuable and our mental bandwidth is limited, so we look for very good solutions, not perfect ones.

Except when it comes to investing. It’s the one area where simple, excellent options are available, yet too many people resist them because they’re too, well, simple. Here’s hoping a recent trend in the ETF marketplace will help investors overcome that tendency.

In the past year or so, all three of Canada’s largest exchange-traded-fund providers have launched products that allow investors to own a complete portfolio with just one trade. Each includes a mix of global stocks and bonds, so anyone with a brokerage account can get extremely broad diversification with minimal maintenance and rock-bottom costs.

Story continues below advertisement

Vanguard Canada was the first ETF provider to launch one-ticket solutions just over a year ago, and iShares followed in December. Earlier this month, BMO joined the party with its own family of all-in-one portfolios.

Let’s look at a typical example: the Vanguard Balanced ETF Portfolio (VBAL). Like its counterparts, it’s a “fund of funds” built using seven underlying ETFs. There are three for fixed income: one each for Canadian, the United States, and global bonds. Then there are four equity components: Canadian, U.S., international developed and emerging markets. Vanguard has estimated that the portfolio offers exposure to about 94 per cent of the world’s public markets.

VBAL has a long-term target of 40-per-cent bonds and 60-per-cent stocks, which is the traditional split for a balanced portfolio. But there are other options for people with different risk profiles, ranging from just 20-per-cent stocks in the Vanguard Conservative Income ETF Portfolio (VCIP) to 80-per-cent stocks in the aggressive Vanguard Growth ETF Portfolio (VGRO). All the funds have the same components, just in different proportions.

The iShares and BMO families are very similar. They vary in their specific holdings, but they all include a target allocation of Canadian and non-Canadian bonds, plus an equity mix with one-quarter to one-third domestic stocks, with the remainder split between the U.S. and overseas markets. In all, we’re talking about thousands of stocks and bonds from around the world, which is all the diversification anyone needs.

Moreover, as markets move in different directions and at different rates, the ETFs will be rebalanced so they maintain those long-term targets. This feature makes them virtually maintenance-free, and it puts some competitive heat on robo-advisers, the online services that charge about 0.50 per cent and advertise automatic rebalancing as one of their key benefits.

And the price tag for this elegant portfolio? The management fees range from 0.18 per cent to 0.22 per cent, which is about 90-per-cent cheaper than traditional balanced mutual funds. On a $100,000 portfolio, the monthly cost is a little more than you’re paying for Netflix.

The good news is that these all-in-one ETF portfolios have been embraced by many do-it-yourself investors: VGRO, for example, has attracted more than $570-million in assets in barely a year. But there has been resistance, too. I’ve heard from many investors who are concerned the funds are not optimized for tax-efficiency, or that you could reduce your fees even further by buying the underlying holdings individually. But how many honestly believe they can build and maintain a better portfolio? In the real world – where people are busy with work and family, and would rather watch the hockey game than fiddle with a spreadsheet – no one manages their portfolio optimally.

Story continues below advertisement

Others dismiss these funds as cookie-cutter solutions, or argue that they’re only appropriate for very small accounts or unsophisticated investors. What nonsense. I’ve reviewed a lot of portfolios over the years, with six- and seven-figure balances, many of which were designed by people who manage money for a living. Almost none of them were more thoughtfully structured than what Vanguard, iShares and BMO have packed into a single ETF.

Are these products right for everyone? Certainly not. Are they perfect? No, but neither is any other option. And here’s the thing: You don’t need an optimal portfolio, you just need an excellent one. No one has ever failed to meet their financial goals because they had exposure to only 94 per cent of the world’s stock and bond markets, or because they failed to keep their investing costs lower than 0.18 per cent. Countless millions have failed by trying to do better.

Eating well and staying in shape takes a lot of effort: It’s much easier to flop on the couch and order pizza. Learning to speak Gaelic, playing the trombone, nurturing a romantic relationship – these take a lot of work. But successful investing is the opposite: You usually thrive by doing less, not more. With the appearance of these all-in-one ETFs, building an extremely well-diversified portfolio has never been easier or cheaper. The only problem that lingers is the one in the mirror.

The #TellMe campaign launched Aug. 28, and within two weeks the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals both promised to make sure that the information would be shared.

Within weeks, several provincial governments across Canada committed to reviewing or changing their reporting policies. Those provinces included British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.

Radiologists say dense breast tissue can obscure cancers on a mammogram, but the majority of Canadian women are unlikely to be aware of the risk or their breast density.

An estimated 80,000 New Brunswick women have dense breasts, and 18,000 of them would fall into the ""highest density"" category, where the accuracy of a mammogram is about 50 per cent, according to studies.

Advocates say women should be given density information on their mammogram report to be able to seek additional, more effective screening.

""A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes before this, but I think that the commitments made by the leaders in New Brunswick really started something,"" Kaufield said.

""I hope it grows and grows until all women across Canada are notified of their breast density, and I'm not going to give up in New Brunswick until that happens.""

The Progressive Conservative government intends to keep its promise, according to Health Minister Ted Flemming.

""It's a platform commitment made by Premier Blaine Higgs and we will follow through with it,"" Flemming said in a statement.

Health Minister Ted Flemming says the province will follow through with its promise. (Jacques Poitras/CBC)

""From a policy point of view, we will consult with our stakeholders, such as the regional health authorities and the New Brunswick Medical Society, to work with us on this issue towards implementation.""

Those consultations began this winter, and Kaufield was one of the stakeholders meeting with the government.

She said the meeting was positive and she was pleased to hear the minister's support.

But the fight for Kaufield and other proponents of change is far from over.

After a fall full of good news, breast cancer and breast density advocates were dealt what they see as a major blow.

New task force guideline

In early January, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care updated its breast cancer guideline. Task force guidelines are peer-reviewed recommended best practices for primary-care providers, and they inform roughly 36,000 family doctors across the country.

The new breast cancer guideline, an update to the original published in 2011, falls short of the change Kaufield and others hoped for.

Describing breast density as an ""emerging risk factor,"" the task force ultimately didn't associate dense tissue with an increased risk of breast cancer, according to Dr. Ainsley Moore, the vice-chair.

Most women aren't routinely informed if they have dense breasts, but the condition can mean cancers are less likely to show up on mammograms. Kathy Kaufield, a cancer survivor and advocate, wants doctors to be mandated to tell women. 16:18

Moore, a clinical associate professor at McMaster University, said density is a risk factor but there are many risk factors for breast cancer, including early menstruation, alcohol intake, a sedentary lifestyle and a full-term pregnancy later in life.

""They're not considered risk factors that put women at a high risk for breast cancer and breast density is not associated with an increased risk of dying from breast cancer,"" Moore said.

""There are uncertainties here and there are subtleties here.""

Moore said there is ""instability"" in how radiologists define and diagnose dense breasts, and there isn't enough ""trustworthy"" data from randomized control trials to point to an effective screening strategy or suggest a woman's chances of survival are improved by screening one way or another.

Dr. Paula Gordon, a breast radiologist and clinical professor at the University of British Columbia, said breast density is far from an emerging risk after decades of studies on the issue and into benefits of additional screening with an ultrasound or MRI.

Gordon, a medical adviser to the foundation Dense Breasts Canada, has said ultrasounds on women with dense breasts double the cancer detection rate over mammography.

She said the evidence used by the task force in forming its guideline is outdated and based on outdated technology. The task force only considers data from randomized control trials, she said, but there isn't a completed breast density trial.

There is a trial going on in Japan, Gordon said, but it could takes years, decades even, before it's finished.

Harms and benefits

The new guideline recommends women aged 50 to 74 undergo mammogram screening every two to three years. For women aged 40 to 49, it recommends against screening with mammography.

Moore said the updated guideline now encourages shared decision-making between patient and doctor if there's an interest in being screened.

""The task force isn't really telling women what to do here. It's providing the tools for women to make the choice best for them.""

Those recommendations are based on the balance of benefits (the probability of surviving breast cancer) and harms of screening (false positives and overdiagnosis).

False positive harm is the undue stress of something picked up by screening that's ultimately nothing or non-threatening. Overdiagnosis is finding indolent cancers that won't cause death but can lead to unnecessary and harmful treatment.

Gordon argued the harms, despite possible physical or emotional pain, do not outweigh the benefit of saving a life.

Gordon has been critical about how the task force operates with no oversight as an independent, arm's-length body from Health Canada and wants to see it restructured.","Breast density campaign helps spur change in province, ripples across Canada",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/breast-density-cancer-screening-report-task-force-guideline-1.5025143

I will now turn the call over to Jim Hoffman, President and CEO of Reliance.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results with you today. 2018 was an incredible year for Reliance, full of significant financial and operational milestones. But more importantly, I'm happy to say, we improved our safety performance and I would like to say thank you to each of our 15,000 plus employees for making safety part of our culture.

In 2018, we achieved numerous earnings records invested in growth through both acquisitions and organic initiative and demonstrated our continued confidence in the strength of our business strategy and outlook by repurchasing a record $484.9 million of our common stock. Earlier this month, we celebrated Reliance's 80th anniversary. Reliance was founded in 1939 based on the core principles of providing outstanding service to our customers. We have grown tremendously in our 80-year history, made possible by our decade long course of expansion through organic growth and strategic acquisitions with emphasis on high margin, specialty products and value-added processing. Today, we are the largest metal service center country -- company in North America, servicing over 125,000 plus customers over 300 locations in 40 states and 13 countries outside of the US.

Despite tremendous growth of our business and footprint, our founding commitment to customer service remains unchanged and our many accomplishments would not be possible without our folks in the field, across the entire Reliance family of companies. We thank each of you, not only for the contributions you have made to our growth, profitability and quality of earnings, but for your unwavering daily commitments to delivering unparalleled customer service enhancing Reliance's safety culture and giving back to the communities in which you live.

I would also like to acknowledge Gregg Mollins, for his immense contributions to Reliance during his time as President and CEO, and throughout his 32-year tenure with the company. Gregg's influence is visible in our -- as our culture of customer service and caring for our employees, as well as our focus on gross profit margin, inventory management and organic growth that contributed to our record financial achievements in 2018. Thank you for all you've done Gregg. 2018 was marked by multiple quarters of record financial performance. We experienced improved pricing conditions healthy demand and excellent execution by our managers in the field. As a result, we generated record net sales of $11.53 billion, which -- when combined with our strong gross profit margin of 28.4% produced record gross profit dollars of $3.28 billion and record pre-tax income of $850.6 million.

Importantly, our pre-tax income increased 45.7% year-over-year on an 18.7% year-over-year increase in sales. Demonstrating the strength of our business model and disciplined strategy of focusing on higher margin business. Our full-year non-GAAP earnings of $8.94 per diluted share was also a new Reliance record and represents a year-over-year increase in 64.3%. Turning to the fourth quarter, while we experienced the normal seasonal decline of lower shipping volumes due to the customer shutdowns and vacation schedules, underlying demand remained healthy and we continue to experience positive demand conditions across end markets we serve.

As a result, our tons sold in the fourth quarter were down 5% from the third quarter of 2018 at the top end of our expected range of down 5% to 7%. Our outlook remains positive in 2019 with feedback on demand trends of our end markets, ranging from steady to strong. Overall metals processing was relatively steady in the fourth quarter with our average selling price per tons sold down 0.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our fourth quarter pricing outlook of flat to up 1% factor in the potential for some price increases. Following the October announcement of a price increase for carbon flat-rolled products which did not hold.

Our average selling price in the fourth quarter increased 20.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by both solid demand and trade actions that supported multiple mill price increases throughout the first nine months of 2018. However, the absence of meaningful mill price increases in the fourth quarter pressured our gross profit margin from elevated levels in the first three quarters of 2018. In addition, we recorded LIFO expense of $106.8 million in the fourth quarter, significantly above our estimate of $55 million, which further impacted our gross profit margin along with the higher than expected tax rate reduced our earnings per diluted share. Karla will discuss the LIFO expense and tax rate in more detail, but in short, adjusting for our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.08 for the $0.55 higher than expected LIFO expense and the $0.10 higher than expected tax rate would have resulted in an earnings per share of $1.73 for the fourth quarter of 2018.

Turning to market conditions in our key end markets. Demand for automotive, which we service mainly through our toll processing operations in the U.S., and Mexico remains very strong. We continue to invest in facilities and value-added processing equipment to meet the increased robust demand for the services we provide, especially related to increased aluminum content in vehicles.

Aerospace also continues to perform well, with mill lead times extending and the backlog for orders remaining solid. We maintain our positive outlook in this market and continue to focus on growing our market share, both domestically and abroad. Demand in heavy industry, energy and non-residential construction was steady in the fourth quarter and we expect actively to remain at similar levels in 2019 as compared to 2018.

Finally, we have noticed in the reduction and demand in semiconductor market. That said, our long-term outlook remains positive and we expect slow improvement in demand as we progress through 2019. As for pricing, mill pricing for carbon steel products remains high levels in the fourth quarter following a number of increases in the first nine months of the year. Pricing for carbon products including plate, structural and tubing, where we have a significant presence were relatively stable during the quarter, though we did see some pressure on carbon flat-rolled price. We believe overall pricing for carbon steel products will remain stable to up in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and we continue to monitor the recent price increases announced on hot-rolled coil.

Our sales into the aerospace market consist of heat-treated aluminum products, especially plate as well as specialty stainless steel and titanium products. Demand for heat-treated aluminum plate remains strong and the 5% to 7% price increase that became effective in January continues to hold. We saw significant strength in pricing for common alloy aluminum products throughout 2018 with continued increases in the fourth quarter. Demand for common alloy aluminum sheet remains strong and supply continues to be tight, which we expect to persist throughout 2019. Based on these trends, the recent $0.07 per pound price increase announced for March was fully supportive.

Demand for our stainless steel flat products continues to be solid. Our average selling price for stainless steel products in the fourth quarter was relatively steady following price increases announced by the mills during the third quarter. As a reminder, pricing for stainless steel products is impacted by nickel prices which remained challenge. Looking ahead, while lead times remain short and surcharges have been pressured, base prices have continued to hold.

Finally, alloy pricing remains relatively strong supported by positive demand trends in automotive and energy. Turning to capital allocation, our 2019 capital expenditure budget of $230 million is once again focused on strategic investments to drive organic growth. We will continue to invest in our facilities and innovative technology and equipment to support our customers need. Importantly, we continue to identify opportunities to expand our value-added processing capabilities, which positively contributed to our gross profit margin.

We are pleased with the robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities in the market, but we will remain selective in our M&A activity. Our November 2018 acquisition of All Metals Holding, LLC aligns with our strategy of acquiring well-run businesses that complement our diversification of products, service, geography and our value-added processing capabilities. All Metals specializes in toll processing and transportation and logistics services primarily for customers servicing the automotive, construction, appliance and other diverse end markets, strengthening our already solid position in these markets.

From a shareholders' return perspective, quarterly cash dividends and share repurchase remain core to our capital allocation philosophy. We paid regular quarterly dividends for 59 consecutive years and the 10% dividend increase announced today represents 26 increase since our 1994 IPO. Our record share repurchases in 2018 reflect the trust and confidence our board and management have in our strong consistent business strategy and outlook. And we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to repurchases.

I am extremely proud of our 2018 financial results made possible by the excellent execution of our dedicated employees and supported by solid pricing and strong demand in the marketplace. Looking ahead, we remain confident about the demand environment in nearly all of the end markets we served, supporting our ability to maximize our earnings power and increase value for our stockholders. In closing, keeping our employees safe is our most important goal and while applaud our team for improving our safety performance through 2018, we must aim to continue to improve in 2019.

Thank you for your time and attention today. I will now turn the call over to Karla to review our fourth quarter 2018 financial results in more detail. Karla?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. Our record sales of $11.53 billion in 2018, were up $1.81 billion from 2017 due to the healthy demand and improved pricing conditions that Jim discussed, as well as our focused pricing discipline and increased levels of value-added processing with 49% of our orders processed in 2018. Our tons sold were up 1% and our average selling price was up 17.9% increase in our average order size in 2018 to $2,130. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.81 billion, up $437.6 million or 18.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. And while our tons sold decreased 1.6% year-over-year, our average stock price per tons sold rose 20.4%.

Our 2018 gross profit of $3.28 billion was a record and our gross profit margin of 28.4% was near the high end of our estimated sustainable range of 27% to 29% primarily due to the positive impact of increased metal pricing in 2018. However, the increased metal prices also negatively impacted our gross profit margin with our highest ever annual LIFO expense of $271.8 million or $2.81 earnings per diluted share compared to $30.7 million or $0.26 EPS in 2017.

Because LIFO is an annual calculation that we estimate during the year and record to actual at the end of each year and because our LIFO expense was $51.8 million higher than we had estimated at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Our LIFO expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $106.8 million or $1.13 earnings per share. This is significantly higher than estimated LIFO expense along with the lack of mill price increases in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined to reduce our gross profit margins to 25.2% and was higher than our LIFO expense of $77.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. When metal prices increase, our inventory costs increase and generate LIFO expense.

This results in lower gross profit during these periods that builds the LIFO reserve that will be reversed and generate LIFO income in future periods when metal prices decline and will positively benefit our gross profit margin and earnings during periods of declining prices. Our 2018 LIFO expense of $271.8 million, increased our LIFO reserve to $293.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Currently, we estimate that metal prices will be somewhat lower at December 31, 2019 then at December 31, 2018 with an estimated annual LIFO benefit or income of $50 million in 2019. As in prior years, we will update our expectations quarterly based upon our inventory costs and metal pricing trends.

As a percentage of net sales, our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 18% down from 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and consistent with the third quarter of 2018. The reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher selling prices in 2018, which increased our net sales. In addition, our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 included a gain from the sale of non-core assets that reduced our expenses by $18.2 million.

Our record pre-tax income of $850.6 million in 2018 represents an increase of $266.8 million or 45.7% compared to 2017 due to our strong execution and a favorable pricing and demand environment. Pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $123.9 million. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% in 2018 with our rate increasing to 29.5% in the fourth quarter as we adjusted certain deferred tax amounts to comply with recently issued interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our tax rate was a negative 6.4% in 2017 due to a one-time benefit of $207.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 attributable to the enactment of the new tax rules.

We currently expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24.5%. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $85.6 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.22, which were reduced by $0.55 as a result of higher-than-expected LIFO expense and $0.10 from our higher tax rate that benefited by $0.20 from the sale of the non-core asset and $0.04 from our share repurchases in the quarter. For the full year, we had record net income of $633.7 million and record earnings per share of $8.75. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were also the highest in Reliance's history at $8.94, up $3.50 or 64.3% from $5.44 in 2017.

Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, our record 2018 earnings resulted in strong cash flow from operations of $664.6 million despite higher working capital requirements, with $431.3 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We used our cash flow to execute on our capital allocation priorities of investing in the growth of our business and returning value to our stockholders. In 2018, we invested a record $239.9 million in capital expenditures and paid $77.6 million to complete three acquisitions to further grow our business.

We also continued to execute on our stockholder return activities with a record share repurchases totaling $484.9 million and payment of $145.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased $4.55 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $77.77 per share for a total of $354.2 million. For the full year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $6.07 million shares at an average cost of $79.94 per share. The pro forma annual effect of our total 2018 share repurchases is $0.77 earnings per diluted share. At December 31, 2018, our total debt outstanding was $2.21 billion resulting in a net debt to total capital ratio of 30.8%, our net debt to EBITDA multiple was 1.7 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $533 million available on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, providing us ample liquidity to continue executing all areas of our capital allocation strategy.

Turning to our outlook, we are optimistic with regard to business conditions in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect that demand in the first quarter will remain healthy. As a result, we estimate our tons sold will be at 6% to 8% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which reflects the normal seasonal increase in shipping volumes compared to the fourth quarter. As Jim discussed, we anticipate price increases for many of our products, given recent announcements and solid pricing fundamentals supported by current demand, raw material costs and the effects of ongoing trade actions.

However, we expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2019 will be flat to down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. As many of these price increases are not effective for the full quarter and our average selling price trended downward during each month of the fourth quarter of 2018. As discussed earlier, we expect our inventory costs at December 31, 2019 to be lower than at the beginning of the year and therefore we currently estimate LIFO income of $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. We also anticipate a $0.17 benefit to our earnings in the first quarter of 2018 due to the lower number of total shares outstanding as a result of our 2018 repurchases.

As a result, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 for the first quarter of 2019. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our financial and operational results in 2018, which were supported by a solid demand and pricing environment and outstanding execution by our employees. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the foundation to continue executing our growth and stockholder return activities. Our record repurchase of $484.9 million of our common stock in 2018 and the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend effective in the first quarter of 2019 together reflect the confidence that our Board and Management have in our business outlook and our ability to perform in the current healthy pricing and demand environment.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention, and at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions, operator?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Great, thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Matthew Korn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, good morning Jim, Karla. First off, congratulations on all the -- all the accomplishments during the year and it was a big year.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank Matt.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Jim thanks. So I have like a micro question and then a macro question for you, in a way. We heard in the fourth quarter according to a lot of the steel mills, and they characterize the buyer strike, and they watched key prices to particularly decline, and that was on top of normal seasonality. And I'm looking at your expectations into 1Q19 is a little softer we expected, little bit below the double-digit growth we've been kind of used to in the last couple of years, going into the first quarter. Question there is, do you see any signs even given your optimism on the demand level that buyers for right now, are still holding out a little bit and going hand to mouth? Was it still the phenomenon that you're seeing.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Matt. Our business really doesn't change that much. We just kind of pay attention to what our customers need. They seem to be positive. Orders are coming in like they always have. As far as the buyer strike, one of the mills guys said that maybe a try, we don't know. We don't, we don't see those kind of things, but it's -- there are, we were conservative by nature, that's just what we do, but we really just pay attention what our customers are telling us and that's reflected in the orders they give us on a day-to-day basis. But we're -- what we said in the script and our release, we're optimistic, and we think it's going to prove out.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And I think Matt those comments were a little more directed as you indicated toward the flat-rolled side of the business, and remember carbon flat-roll is only about 15% of our total sales dollars. So we see that enforcement of business and we think some of the recent price increase announcements may help spur some of those folks to start buying again.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, appreciate that. And let me ask on, one more bigger picture question. In the wake of the higher steel prices that we've seen in flat loans, policy changes in the U.S., over this past year, there has been the number of mills expanding the capabilities, expanding the capacities. Many of these seemingly are in the regions where they feel underserved or whether as there is particular high growth potential. Do you see any kind of risk to your business from a broader steel mill reach or deeper availability of things like coated or painted or the types of processed steel, if these things really to come true?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I don't, -- again we are -- we run the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month and we just again service our customers where they want to be serviced, we listen to them, all the capacity is coming online. We know all those folks. We're a big customer of all of them. They all have very smart people running those companies, that's what they see is good, good for them and that will be good for us. So I really don't see any risk coming on board to that, we actually our customer and their customer of ours, we do a lot of -- as you've probably realize that we do call processing for a lot of those folks and they are positive. And we like it when our domestic partners are profitable and busy. So we're -- we applaud their decisions, because they're all -- they make good decisions and we're going to be there for them and they will be there for us. So I don't see a big risk.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, appreciate it Jim. Congratulations again.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi, good morning everyone.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Just wondering if you could touch on what you're seeing so far over the past month or so here with new order entries and maybe talk about what you believe could be driving lower year-on-year volumes more recently, as well as into 1Q here, which I think is implied by the guidance?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

If I understand your question promptly, again we -- it just changes daily. We run the company day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month. We can have a good day, and not so good days. There's really nothing that I can really pin point.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I mean volumes were a little lighter, Q4'18 to '17, you know and I think the MSCI numbers for January came out, and they were down a little bit from January last year, but overall, even with the slight decrease, I mean, as Jim mentioned earlier, our customers are still optimistic. I think there's been a little uncertainty in the market from a pricing standpoint, and just general macro concerns out there, but as Jim indicated, I mean day-to-day our customers are busy, maybe not as busy as they were, maybe not buying as much as the year ago, but we're still on -- positive on demand, we're very -- the demand is supporting, helping pricing levels and we can do very well in this type of environment, even with demand down slightly.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And another thing to remember Martin, we have a really diverse group of customers going into a lot of different markets. And it's hard -- it's even difficult for us to look at our company as this massive company. We don't run it that way, we run it like we have many customers and many markets and they all do different things and one market is up, very few times in my 38-year career has every market been up at the same time and every market has been down at the same time. So we've got it -- as part of our strategy also obviously the companies we buy and the products we sell, we like to spread it out as much as we can. So we're a little less of the target when things -- things change dramatically in the market as -- part of our market could be up.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. I appreciate all that detail there. Maybe, if you can just provide an update also on your tolling business there. You touched on this briefly in prepared remarks and kind of continued strength within automotive and I guess what you're seeing at the start of this year, expectations on volumes as the year progresses, and maybe just review some of the past and future growth initiatives that you've had there?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We like that business. It's a good business for us. It continues to do well. We continue to invest, we've got nice company in Mexico with four locations and we've expanded that. We have a lead company in the U.S. that's extremely busy and as Karla mentioned our CapEx dollars, that they -- it's a capital-intensive business, and we continue to expand their offerings when the -- the number of units and the SARs report comes up, when it goes up or down, it's still at a really, really high number, which is good for us and over the last couple of years we picked up a lot of share, if you will, because of the exposed aluminum that happens to be going, and that's being designed into all kinds of different automobiles, particularly light trucks and what have you, SUVs, that's kind of our sweet spot. And again this one particular company has kind of one of a kind type equipment that we design and build ourselves and they've got a great relationship with -- in the market.

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

And we're also really excited about the new acquisition, All Metals. So that's going to add to the tolling part of our business.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And in addition to All Metals, we also increased our ownership of the Acero Prime, our toll processing business in Mexico during the fourth quarter that we now have a 100% ownership of that. So, and we see growth opportunities for them as well and also just to point out our -- the number of tons sold that we report do not include any of our tolling tons and we have seen increases in the number of tons that we've sold both in the fourth quarter of '18 versus the fourth quarter of '17 and in January so far we're also up compared to last year. So because of the investments that we've made in the growth we continue to see us doing more there and picking up the market share primarily -- especially with the aluminum forces.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, another factor, remember, our customer base in that business, it really isn't the end user. It's the producers of the product, whether it be steel or aluminum. So that's kind of a unique relationship. We're their customer and they are our customer.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks for all the detail there. I don't know if you'll touch on it at all, but are tolling volumes in excess of your reported volumes now.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, they are, and they have been for quite some time.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, excellent. Thanks for all the color on that business there.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Sure.

Operator

Our next question is from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, hey, good morning, guys. And happy 80th anniversary.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay, so I wanted to ask a little bit more. First, on the year-over-year question that Matt asked earlier, I get the sequential improvement, but are there any areas in particular that are performing worse year-over-year or better if you could just give a little bit more color? And if you could talk a little bit more while you're at it about your key carbon products specifically plate and beams.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Timna, like I said in the remarks. The one market that's not doing real well right now but does have legs going forward is the semiconductor business, it's good business for us. It's a little slow right now, what we anticipate that getting better at some point and then the rest of the markets that we're doing are at good ones. They're at good levels, and levels and they've been better and they've been worse, and so we're OK and we like -- we kind of like where it is. We like where it's going as far as the -- Bill, do you want to say anything about aerospace or anything --?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Aerospace continued strength as we said, we really watch lead times backlog and build rates, all those are very positive and our outlook for aerospace continues to be very fast.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Timna, what was your question on the plate and beams?

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Just a bit more color on those markets and non-res construction is big for you guys, within plate, beams and pipe, and I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those products in that market?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, those are good markets for us. The non-res is chugging along kind of, and we also -- as you all know, we also grow infrastructure spending in there and so we haven't seen that yet, we're all like the rest of Americans are waiting to see if we're going to fix all those bridges that are falling down. So we're hoping that that will come, but as far as the business that we're participating in, it continues to go on in a good direction. We'll see there were some filings and some suits filed on -- let you know, about the product coming in from China into Canada being stock -- semi producers and shipped back into the U.S, which is absolute cheating by the way, and we don't appreciate that no American really should appreciate that. However, that's happening and I don't know -- I have no idea what's that -- what's that findings will be or what the penalties will be, but certainly if that does happen, then we will have a more of a fair -- our fabricators, domestic fabricators will have a fair, more even playing field to participate in. So that could give us a nice little bump.

Plate -- plates are really good product for us, it's an unusual market to figure out what goes on. right now. I believe that plate pricing is, well, it's kind of just a little flat right now. And I -- with Korea being shut out for so long last year, there is an uptick -- the import is an uptick coming in, right now because they're -- they got shut out because of the quality. Now they're getting to catch up. That can't last long. So there may be a little down take in the pricing. I don't know, certainly the import pricing that we do see, it's not attractive. We're not participant but we get all of the offerings and this really not there to drag, I don't see what you can count on Reliance is not participating because we're still 95% huge fans for domestic partners. So we're going to continue to support them. So again, again kind of a boring answer because it continues to be just fine.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay. And I'm surprised you guys didn't mentioned in a while. I know you guys were involved in that. I think, you mentioned tubing was part of the walls initial phases years ago and now that it looks like it might be getting under way, again, is that an opportunity for you?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I know about as much as the wall -- about what's going to happen to more as you do, nobody knows. So all I know is that -- we sell metal and people talk metal going into that wall and we certainly will call on pieces and parts of that we have in the past. And if they decide to build some of it, I hope they call Reliance for their tubing in the flight that goes into it.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay, fantastic. I could switch to Karla. I want to ask a couple of questions on cash flows and just what to expect for 2019. You should see a pretty big working capital release you had in this last couple of quarters. It sounds some pretty high days of inventory and then they kind of came down sharply by the end of the year. Any color you can give us on what kind of working capital release you might expect assuming kind of stable prices? And then on the buyback, is that a signal of more to come or will you capitalizing on a particularly weak market in Q4.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So, hi Timna, first off on the cash flows, we had a strong cash flows in 2018, $665 million for the year and that was, as you commented with higher working capital requirements, primarily from the cost -- the price standpoint of the metals. So, we anticipate given our guidance on LIFO and things that we would have a little relief, just from a price standpoint in 2019. And our inventories, we did end the year at a higher level than what our goal is inventories is still in decent shape, but a little higher than we prefer to see them. So, we do anticipate some relief from a quantity standpoint on the inventory this year. So, certainly we would anticipate being at a higher level than the $665 million of cash flow from our last year, what level, we are not really projecting or guiding toward that but certainly, we're expecting it to be stronger than in 2018.

From a buyback standpoint, we're consistent with the way we're approaching buybacks, being opportunistic and really looking at where the stock was trading in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of volatility. They gave us a lot of opportunity, we looked at buying back shares of Reliance is being the most low risk acquisition that we can make. So we needed to see our stock trading there, but we're pleased we were able to repurchase the shares at that level because we think it's very positive for our shareholders on a long-term basis. So we took advantage of that and we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward. I think, I saw some hints of comments that maybe we bought back more stock because we didn't see other opportunities but we continue to see opportunities for all of our capital allocation levers, as Jim mentioned in his comments. There are still acquisition opportunity out there, we expect to continue to execute on that as we move forward as we did last year.

Dividends, we just increase again in the first quarter of this year. So we're happy to do that for our shareholders and then we're continuing to invest in capital expenditures to grow the business, we're at our highest level last year and have a high budget for this year because we continue to see a lot of good opportunities to do more for our customers. So, we'll approach the share buybacks, the same way we have been doing.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay. High quality (ph) problem. Thanks a lot guys.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Timna.

Our next question is from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Please go head.

Chris Terry -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Firstly, just to flesh out the capital management. Just a little bit further, basically in terms of buyback and dividend in total, you paid close to the net income of the company to 2018, understand you use buybacks opportunistically. Maybe you can just comment on the split of buybacks versus dividends and the -- the total amount that you willing to allocate. And the second question I had, it's probably for Karla as well. Just on the CapEx around the 230 level, 240 level over the last two years, a few years ago it used to be below the 200 level. Should we eventually expect that you glide down to that point or how do we think about forward CapEx. Thank you.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Hi, Chris. So first off on kind of the capital allocation and the split between buybacks and dividends. We did have a fairly high shareholder return cash amount out last year but as we commented, we think it was good execution on that. Dividends, we did not have a formal policy that -- what we try to do is make sure we're returning from a yield standpoint, kind of at or above markets levels for our best-in-class type of stock. We also don't want to make sure that our quarterly dividend rate is at a long-term sustainable level because we have never and do not want to in the future have to reduce or start paying a dividend. So that's kind of how we manage the dividend there as the company continues to grow, we're able to increase our dividend rate periodically which we have to continue to do going forward, but want to keep it at that sustainable level.

And then as we mentioned on the share buyback, it's really opportunistic. We look at where the stock's trading. We look at other opportunities and we'll execute with that. So we don't have a set target, we want the flexibility to be able to jump into the market, and we think it makes the most sense for us. And then on -- from a CapEx standpoint, you've seen our gross profit margin improve our sustainable range, which we think the sustainable part of that has really been due to the additional value-added processing that we're doing, and where we can provide more value to our customers. So we're able to get paid for that and so our people out in this field work very closely with their customers and we are always looking for opportunities of how can we do more for our existing customers and some prospective customers.

And so with the opportunities we've seen, we have been at higher levels of capital expenditures over the last few years, we've also taken advantage of some of the -- of our operations center in leased facilities. If there are good operations for our businesses we prefer to own those. So we've also bought out some of our leased properties and those indeed bigger ticket items for us, but again remember that we were doing in that $230 million, there are a lot of different CapEx items, there are 300 different -- 300 plus different operating locations out there and we're continuing to invest in all of them with equipment and facility upgrade.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Chris, Karla is right. Our customers are asking us to do more and more. They are just -- they are -- whatever their business plan is, they seems to be shifting a bit and we're kind of known for being a value-added type of business and when they ask and that makes sense for us, we'll buy, technology certainly changes a lot of the equipment we buy. Saws and lasers and all the different things where we get into now are frankly better than they were X amount of years ago, they hold tighter tolerances, they are faster, they are safer, and when we see an opportunity like that we can -- like Karla said offer something different to our customer base and make money on it, then we're going to do it and we've got a lot of really bright operators out in the field. And when they ask, we listen.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And to your longer term question Chris, I mean, I think coming back down to $200 million for an average longer term CapEx level is probably reasonable.

Chris Terry -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. Thanks, Jim, thanks Karla, all makes sense. Appreciate it.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Chris.

(Operator Instructions) My next question is from Chris Olin from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Hey, good morning.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Chris.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Chris.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Curious, given your view on kind of the short-term -- shorter-term order trends, was the business or any of the stores impacted by either weather in the fourth quarter, particularly on the construction markets? Or did you see any kind of abnormal order activity during the government shutdown that could've support the business?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Chris, we don't -- we never blame our business on the weather or on something and that we can't control. Because what happens is -- if they need the product or the part and they can't get it today or tomorrow because of weather or government shutdown or some, they're eventually going to need, it. So if we may -- the timing may move, sometimes the timing moves month-to-month or over a quarter, but eventually it comes back. So we don't -- we don't, the weather and the government shutdown, things like that we do not -- we don't control that, but all we can really control is that we can provide on an uninterrupted flow of really good product to our customer bases. So when they do open back up or when they're able to receive the material -- we'll get it to. So it could be delayed by a couple of days, sometimes a week, I don't know how bad the situation is, but we've been out that long time. So doesn't really change.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Okay, that's fair. And I guess my second question is, can you talk a little bit more about aerospace? I guess, specifically, I'm curious if you anticipate any type of negative impact on, say, the aluminum plate market given the news about Airbus canceling its A380 program, that's a pretty big consumer of material, just any risk of inventory management or something like that?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Hey Chris, this is Bill. We really don't -- if you look at the aerospace plate market right now on the supply side, it's extremely tight. And again, when we look at the future, and we look at where mill lead times are, backlogs and build rates, it's very positive. Long-term, I mean if you look at what will happen with the cancellation, our eventual cancellation of that plane that will take obviously some capacity or some need out of the market, but overall that's being built back with conversions to other planes. So I think, if we look at -- right now on the aerospace side, the outlook continues to be very positive. We've had tremendous strength in North America and maybe the rest of the world wasn't quite as strong. Now we're seeing the rest of the world improve a bit too. So all of that leads to a real positive outlook on the aerospace side.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Can I just ask what percentage of your business now is aerospace related?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

On the sales dollar basis, it's probably around 12%.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey good morning.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Phil.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Sometimes of a little bit more, maybe a little bit more color on the CapEx budget this year pretty healthy again has we noted a couple of times, but any big projects in particular, in that number. I know you talked about some of the value-added processes and a lot of your customers pulling you in those directions, which is a good problem to have, but any notable pieces in there?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

I think, Phil, as I mentioned, we've got a couple of facilities where we are buying out the leases. So that takes up a chunk of the CapEx. We announced last year that we were expanding our aluminum toll process -- our toll processing business down in Kentucky to support a lot of the growth of aluminum down there. So that was a big item for last year carrying over into this year, it's really a lot of equipment and it's really spread out.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

They're all bigger clients. I mean, tube lasers are, $2 million plus. Flat lasers are well over $1 million. Those are, those are big ticket items. So we take them over a very seriously. So those that we have, I guess that we have -- we have a lot of big events that are -- that roll up into that large number. And if you would see as the front-out of our CapEx you'd be amazed how many line items are on that thing. But they all add up, and they're all expenses.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Then Karla your share count for the first quarter. Can you give us just exactly what that number is, I think you had pushed us some direction there?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, so basically our actual shares outstanding at the end of 2018, we're at just over or just under $67 million shares and we generally have about a $1 million more shares that gets added to our diluted earnings per share. So right around 68-ish million shares.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, that's helpful. And just want to say Greg if you're out there, I hope you're on the beach somewhere (ph).

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

He's probably sleeping, he is trying to get that fish in the boat.

Our next question is from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Hey good morning. Just wanted to touch on SG&A, a little bit. So we have seen some inflation labor transportation costs. Just curious if you can update on some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing there, is that abating, getting worse and what appreciated? Thanks.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, so I think one thing on the SG&A, Tyler that we had commented on earlier in 2018 and as you've seen in -- our profitability levels, especially our pre-tax levels were up significantly in 2018 compared to prior years, and our compensation structure is very performance-based, not just here in our corporate office but also out in all of our management teams that are different operations. So, our elevated pre-tax income levels in '18, drove our compensation expense up because of that, which we think, it's kind of a good problem to have.

So, in '19 even though we expect continued high levels of profitability as a percent the margins and with some expectation that prices might come down a bit and not having the consistent mill increases that allow us to pop up our gross profit margin. We would expect some of that comp expense to potentially come down. We could get normal raises in 2019 as we normally do. So there is some inflation that you need to build in and I think the transportation costs, we did see a big ramp up last year, it's still a tight market out there for us to hire drivers and then also for our third-party carriers. But we're not expecting increases the rates that we had last year.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Great. Yeah, thanks for all that color. So I guess the other, the last question I had was just on -- and I think you alluded to it earlier, but the M&A opportunities that you're seeing out there in -- at least, still aggressively pursuing that growth angle. Just curious, if you could provide us an update with -- what kind of opportunities you're seeing, right now. What are you seeing in terms of valuation and where would you be more positively disposed to in terms of expanding your reach from an end market or product category perspective?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, with the -- let's call it a target-rich environment. There's a lot of opportunities coming our way. We looked at lot of them last year. We pulled the trigger on -- how many, we did about three. But we don't change our kind of game plan when it comes to look at M&A, you have to -- you have to reach a certain point. We don't buy fixer-uppers. We like -- we only buy companies that are immediately accretive. They have to have the right people involved, they have to fit our culture. They have to good succession planning in place, and if you have those things and you make money and we like it. There's pretty good chance we'll talk to you and visit and see if we can't work something out so they're not there. Over the last couple of years this is my opinion.

I think that the tax reform kind of answered a lot of questions for these kind of family owned companies that are out there, that have been launched, they that want to sell because of the generational thing. Grandpa started the business, dad ran it, the kids don't want to be part of it and that's kind of companies it seems like we talked to a lot of I think. So there are more willing to engage with us and in kind of more willing to sell at reasonable price, sometimes people think their companies are off worth a lot more than we may think there were, but there's lot of out there. We stay busy. There's not a week doesn't come by that, Karla doesn't walk down the hall and hand me a several other than say, hey look, these guys. So it's busy.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And I think on valuation, we have not changed the way we value companies that we try to look over a cycle and understand what we think the right normalized level of future earnings is for them and then we value the company based upon that. 2018 was a really good year for Reliance. It was also a good year for a lot of other companies out there, and we understand that. So, when we look at opportunities. We understand what happened in '18 and we believe we're still evaluating consistently and we hope that other potential buyers out there are sharp enough to also understand, that 2018 created some really strong earnings from our companies.

And then also Tyler, you asked about if there are any specific targets. You know, it really, other than the fact that what Jim mentioned about. We look for good companies. We do like kind of the higher margin specialty products and higher value add type companies but we look at every opportunity that's out there and determine if we think it's the right fit for Reliance or not.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thanks very much.

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks. Just one quick follow-up on Aerospace Aluminium heat-treated plate. Can you talk about how the lead times compare today versus where they were at in fourth quarter and maybe touch on the inventory trends there, whether there's any kind of destocking that still persist?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Yeah, happy to do that Martin. This is Bill. The lead times, I mean we've gone -- just recently, we've seen some of the domestic mills. The lead times have moved out one completely sold out through 2019. So, the supply side of that continues to be on the type side and as I mentioned, we receive the rest of the world that we're in the market was not as strong. We are seeing that improve. So, those lead times from those suppliers are starting to move out and so again, we see continued strength on the aerospace side.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks for that. And the inventory trends there, what are you seeing?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

There is some talk in the market about destocking. I think that's really more at the OEM level, it's really not an issue in terms of our business. See in a couple of reports where that the position was that destocking or the inventory in the system was moderating or there was less of it. I think that's specific to a couple of situations overall from our inventory standpoint, we're in good shape. We are not overstocked by any means.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Clement made his first post to Instagram Wednesday since he resigned as a Conservative MP in November.

Wednesday’s post includes a picture of him standing in the new House of Commons with a statement thanking his followers for getting him through the “dark valley” after the scandal broke.

In November Clement admitted he shared explicit images online with someone he believed to be a consenting female adult but who then turned around and demanded he pay 50,000 euros to prevent the images from going public.

He initially claimed it was a one-time lapse in judgement but when it became clear it wasn’t, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked him to resign from the party caucus.

Clement now sits as an independent and says he is getting back to his duties as the MP for Parry Sound-Muskoka.

“I had a severe personal crisis and it manifested itself in the irrational behaviour that became apparent and for which I take full responsibility,” Clement says on Instagram.

He also says he was “getting the counselling I needed and working on my family life” during his time away from office.

Earlier this year, two men in the Ivory Coast were arrested and charged with trying to blackmail Clement.

The RCMP is continuing to work with the Ivory Coast’s cyber crimes unit.

Chinese technology giant Huawei today unveiled a new folding-screen smartphone on Sunday, which will run on superfact 5G networks and cost twice as much as the latest Apple iPhone, retailing for around £2,000.

Huawei revealed the Mate X phone on the eve of a four-day industry event in Spain to showcase new devices, and Executive Director, CEO of the Consumer Business Group, Richard Yu said it would satisfy consumers' demands for bigger screens and longer battery life when it goes on sale in the summer.

But what is less clear is whether it will satisfy users' demands for privacy, with Huawei under intense suspicion by Western intelligence chiefs who fear the company works as a front for the vast Chinese spy apparatus.

Richard Yu, the Executive Director, CEO of the Consumer Business Group, presented the new Huawei Mate X smartphone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), on the eve of the world's biggest mobile fair in Barcelona

The Mate has a foldable screen which wraps around the outside of the product, allowing users to view the screen when closed

The new Huawei Mate X device unfolded (left) and folded over (right). Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet

At the glitzy Barcelona launch of the device Mr Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut

Unveiling his company's latest brainchild, Mr Yu asked: 'How can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?'

The Mate X us his answer. The screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it's closed, unlike its competitor, the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut.

Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.

Mr Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut.

The Mate X will retail for £1,996 (2,299 euros or $2,600) when it goes on sale by midyear. The latest iPhone costs around £1,000 and more than Samsung's recently revealed Galaxy Fold, another folding smartphone, which is priced at 'only' $2,000.

Huawei CEO Richard Yu displays the new Huawei Mate X foldable 5G smartphone at the Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona

But consumer who do choose to fork over the price of a second-hand car for the new Chinese phone may be getting more than they bargain for.

The firm, which is also involved in the upgrade of the telecoms network itself, is at the centre of a global row about cybersecurity with multiple Western spy chiefs concerned its technology creates a back door allowing the Beijing regime to listen in on Western conversations.

Senior MPs have called for Britain to ban Huawei from working on the 5G mobile internet upgrade completely.

Conservative MPs Julian Lewis and Bob Seely urged the government to follow the UK's 'Five Eyes' intelligence partners Australia and New Zealand and stop the firm from working on critical infrastructure projects. However, a Huawei spokesperson responded that the New Zealand government `turned down a single 5G proposal submitted for review by one carrier, but the regulatory process was still ongoing'.

Dr Lewis told MailOnline: 'What we have to remember is despite their protestations of independence, there is no such thing as an independent enterprise under a Communist regime.

'And until such time as China ceases to be a dictatorship of the Communist party in China then there can be no meaningful claim to independence by enterprises. We should definitely follow Australia's and New Zealand's example.'

And Mr Seely, a Tory MP and defence expert, warned China may be able to discover the UK's vulnerabilities if its firms are given the crucial contracts.

Their intervention came after Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he had 'grave concerns' about Huawei.

Julian Lewis (pictured left) and Bob Seely (pictured right) urged the government to follow its Five Eyes intelligence partners Australia and New Zealand and stop the firm from working on critical infrastructure projects.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has expressed 'grave' concerns at the prospect of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei being involved in the UK's new 5G network

Mr Williamson said: 'I have grave, very deep concerns about Huawei providing the 5G network in Britain. It's something we'd have to look at very closely.

'We've got to look at what partners such as Australia and the US are doing in order to ensure that they have the maximum security of that 5G network and we've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.'

Huawei said it was not banned from current or future networks, and the GSCB clarified that the telco could still work with Huawei to address the security risk.

Only last month Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the cyber arm of the UK’s electronic surveillance organisation, , GCHQ, said Huawei still has not produced a ‘credible plan’ to address security concerns.

He said: 'Last year we said we found some worrying engineering and security issues. As of today, we have not seen a credible plan. That’s the reality of the situation unfortunately.’

And Ciaran Martin, head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said he had separate concerns that the company fell short on security standards for its product, regardless of any possible link to Chinese spying.

President Donald Trump signaled on Tuesday that he might reverse a ban which currently prevents Huawei selling phones in the USA as part of a larger China trade deal, tweeting that the U.S. shouldn't win the 5G mobile arms race by 'blocking out currently more advanced technologies'

Trump tweeted less than 90 minutes after Huawei boss Ren Zhengfei s declared in a TV interview that his copmany was not involved in espionage

Huawei phones are currently banned in the US, which considers the Chinese giant's technology a security threat, and only last August President Trump signed into law a bill reaffirming the embargo.

The cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada.

They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.

But in what may be a signal of a forthcoming policy shift, the president tweeted on Thursday that he wants the U.S. 'to win through competition' rather than by blocking out technologies which are currently more advanced.

Allowing Huawei's mobile phone equipment back into U.S. markets could be a carrot for Beijing as Trump's negotiators hash out a new trade framework with the world's second largest economy.

Huawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the creator of the software on Android phones.

Huawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don't know how to pronounce ('HWA-way'), is jockeying for a seat at the top table. Last year it was third in global smartphone sales, behind Apple and Sansung in pole position.

Huawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to the devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.

It remains to be seen whether Britain's savvy consumers will decide £2,000 - plus the risk of their private conversations being overheard by Chinese spies in windowless Beijing listening posts - is a price worth paying for the latest shiny tech toy.

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The Greatest Constitutional Crisis Since the Civil War

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse becausein fired FBI Director James Comeys formulationa higher duty than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Orin fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wordsthe threat was too great. Nevermind that the nature of the threat was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offendersand Offenses

The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureaus ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as an insurance policy against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming presidents reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trumps supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public Attention

The special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the high crimes and misdemeanors required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the presidents enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his higher duty, lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

And now we have Andrew McCabes proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the Polls

This entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsels inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the elections result.

A powerful Tory backbencher and future leadership contender last night set himself on a collision course with Theresa May over her hardline stance on immigration.

Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, let rip in a coded assault on the PM at the spring gathering of the party’s grassroots officials.

In a plea not to clamp down on Britain’s borders after Brexit, he said the UK must be ‘more open’ in order to attract the brightest immigrants.

In a withering attack, he said: ‘I was struck when in India recently, when I heard time and again that some of the best students weren’t coming to Britain.

‘They were going to Australia and New Zealand, to the United States and Canada to study there… because their countries are open.

'They are more engaged, more willing to accept students from around the world. Instead of looking open, too often we have been closed.

‘If we are going to play our part in the world, we need to change that.’

His rebuke comes after one of the three MPs to quit the Conservative Party last week claimed that Mrs May’s desire to end freedom of movement from Europe was a key reason behind why they left.

Anna Soubry said she was ‘really worried’ that the Prime Minister has a ‘problem with immigration’.",Tory backbencher Tom Tugendhat goes head-to-head with Theresa May on immigration,Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6738169/Tory-backbencher-Tom-Tugendhat-goes-head-head-Theresa-immigration.html

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

150,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

She made a point of thanking her more critical questioners, including Dale Swanson, a founder of the local conservative women’s coalition, for their presence and their questions.

“If you’re only walking into comfortable spaces and comfortable rooms,” she added, “you’re probably not doing your job.”

But Ms. Spanberger said she has had conversations with colleagues in more solid blue districts about the impact of both hard-line liberal policy and the tone of opposition, which have prompted her to emphasize in town halls, sometimes unprompted, that she is “absolutely not a socialist.”

“When people say things in snarky ways or disrespectful ways or flippant ways, that creates an issue in districts like ours,” she said. “It’s real easy to be kind of snarky in the majority.”

More broadly, constituents worried how their moderate congressman might fare in the same caucus as the liberal bomb throwers. Richard Hansen, a Republican county commissioner and one of the two dozen constituents who attended the town hall in Nephi, a mountain town of 6,000, shared a wish with the Utah Democrat: “I hope they don’t corrupt you.”

“They won’t,” Mr. McAdams pledged. “There have been some articles about this, a little bit of tension on the Democratic side: Are we going to veer to the far left or are we going to stay in the center?

Trump believes he has a winning hand with the economy and frequently touts a low unemployment rate, strong growth and stock market gains since his 2016 election victory.

Democrats, who won ground in gubernatorial elections in 2018, are looking for ways to convert the messages that worked in those state contests into victory in the presidential election in 2020.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who defeated incumbent Republican Scott Walker in one of the biggest upsets last year, said the unemployment rate in his state did not reflect the struggles faced by voters.

“Yes, we have a 3 percent unemployment rate, but we also have 800,000 families that are struggling just to put food on the table. ... We have a long way to go,” Evers said in Washington, where he attended a weekend meeting of Democratic and Republican governors from across the country.

Trump won Wisconsin by a close margin in the 2016 presidential election, and it is a major target for Democrats in 2020.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, elected last year in a state that only narrowly voted Democratic in the 2016 presidential election, said voters in his state are concerned about corporate gains not flowing down to workers.

“There is no doubt that Minnesotans and Americans are working harder and (are) more productive, but most of that gain has not been seen in the middle class,” Walz said.

Walz has endorsed U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, for the Democratic presidential nomination.

New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, also elected last year, said Democrats needed to counter Trump’s message by talking about how low wages, expensive health insurance and rising costs are squeezing middle-class voters.

She said she was concerned about Democrats’ ability to articulate an effective message on the economy and show voters how their own policies encourage investment and well-paid jobs.

“I do worry. ... If Democrats around the country, including me, are not talking about those precise strategies ... I think we won’t get attention for the economic efforts that we’re making,” she said.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who has endorsed U.S. Senator Cory Booker, also of his state, for president, said Democrats should not abandon their message about social issues to talk about the economy.

“We don’t make economic progress without social progress, and likewise, you don’t make social progress without economic progress,” Murphy said.",U.S. Democrats seek ways to counter Trump's economic message,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-democrats-idUSKCN1QD0ZP

“It takes movements like ours to push parties to prioritize what the base wants and what the values of the party are,” Mr. Shahid said. “That is the role of our movement, to give a policy vision for this country to a party that often lacks a clear policy vision.”

A spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, said its focus remained on defeating President Trump and expanding the current House majority. (The committee has announced a slate of 32 seats held by Republicans it intends to challenge.) Mr. Cuellar, asked last month about Justice Democrats’ challenge, reminded reporters that this would not be his first round beating back a primary opponent.

“What happened to the Democratic Party being a tent?” Mr. Cuellar said as he described a moderate Democratic constituency in his district, which stretches from the Mexican border to the suburbs of San Antonio. “An outside group that thinks they know southwest Texas politics better than I do are going to find out.”

Both supporters and opponents of Justice Democrats say that with the 2018 election barely in the rearview mirror, it is too early to assess how primary challenges might disrupt the Democratic field. But in a presidential year, when turnout in the primaries is often much higher than in midterm election seasons, Justice Democrats has the potential to be far more disruptive than it was in 2018, and the group and its allies are in a fighting mood.

“We should absolutely be allowed to contest what it means to be a Democrat,” Mr. McElwee said in an interview. “You can’t have a tent that includes both people of color and people who work to undermine the rights and humanity of people of color.” He pointed to Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who defeated a more progressive Democrat, Tom Perriello, in the primary, only to be consumed in scandal for his use of blackface in the 1980s.

Liberal primary challengers are not new to the Democratic Party, but they can be costly.

The voter, Rahul Parsa, who teaches at Iowa State University’s business school, said he told Ms. Harris at a gathering of Asian and Latino activists that she needs to think of the Democratic Party in the Midwest like a struggling retail business — and that she should seek out not just the regular customers, but those who are not loyal supporters as well .

“Kamala needs to find out why the people voted for Trump, what are their issues?” said Mr. Parsa, adding that he had one overarching demand for the burgeoning field of would-be nominees: “You need to bring some states in the Midwest.”

As the Democratic race takes flight, with one or more candidates entering the race almost every week, Mr. Parsa’s viewpoint represents one side of a long-simmering debate within t he party : Should Democrats redouble their efforts to win back the industrial heartland that effectively delivered the presidency to Donald J.

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

Republicans are increasingly erasing any daylight between themselves and President Trump, and it may be about to happen again. This is his party, and more importantly, this practice has been an active decision by Republican elected officials.

When Trump's presidency is over, Republicans will spend many years reckoning with the decisions they have made.

In Arizona and nationally, the two-party system denies voters choices they may prefer. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

The discussion about moving American politics beyond the two-party system needs to become much more serious.

This thought is spurred by two factors: The decision by Grant Woods not to run for U.S. Senate. And the unappetizing choice the two parties are likely to offer for president in 2020.

Woods has been a close personal friend for five decades. Politically, however, we disagree at least as much as we agree. These days, probably more. So, this isn’t a brief that Woods should be our next senator.

But he is an appealing political persona, as evidenced by having been elected attorney general while in his 30s. Woods is a gifted orator, as the country learned from his eulogy for John McCain. And his comic skills are worthy of a professional.

His policy positions are best described as eclectic. He doesn’t have an ideological lens through which he views issues. He sort of picks and chooses as he goes along.

There are moments, and this may be one of them, when that fits the mood of the electorate. Woods would have a realistic chance of winning a general election for U.S. Senate.

But he does not have a realistic chance of winning either a Republican or Democratic primary for such.

Independent candidates aren't the solution

CLOSE The current system produces candidates that don't reflect what most voters want. That's a problem, azcentral columnist Robert Robb says. Diana Payan, The Republic | azcentral.com

He could run as an independent. That’s a steep hill. And a serious independent challenger in any race means that whoever wins will undoubtedly receive less than a majority of the votes.

Being governed by a plurality rather than a majority erodes legitimacy. More independent candidates isn’t a solution to the structural problem of a nominating system that precludes candidates voters might prefer.

Former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson, who also finds himself in no-man’s land in the two-party system, has championed the idea of a top-two primary. All candidates of all parties, and of no party, would run against each other in the primary. The top two vote-getters would run against each other in the general election. Someone like Woods would have a chance to make it to the finals in such a system.

Unfortunately, Johnson, so far, hasn’t been willing to go whole-hog and make the system entirely non-partisan, without party labels on the ballot. If there are party labels on the ballot, parties should have a say in who gets to run under their banner.

It’s more difficult to envision a way out of the two-party trap at the national level.

National choices are even more unappetizing

Unless the Mueller investigation turns up more than expected, Trump will undoubtedly be the Republican nominee.

It seems inevitable that the Democrats will nominate someone who proposes adopting European-style social democracy in this country. That means a gigantic expansion of the welfare state and massively greater government intervention in the economy.

The nominee will probably be cagey about how to pay for it. But the only revenue source capable of producing the needed sum is a value-added tax, the workhorse of public finance in Europe.

A continuation of Trump or European-style social democracy probably isn’t the choice a majority of voters would like to see.

Starbucks honcho Howard Schultz is mulling an independent run. He professes to be economically conservative but socially liberal. That’s the largest voting bloc that doesn’t fit comfortably in either party.

Schultz could throw the election to the House

I think that Schultz has the potential to be more than just a spoiler, siphoning off anti-Trump votes from the Democratic nominee. In this crazy political environment, and with what the Democrats are likely to offer, an independent candidate has a chance to be a contender.

But if Schultz could actually win some states, that would mean, realistically, that no candidate would obtain an electoral college majority. That would throw the election into the House of Representatives. Which in turn means that the presidential race would actually be decided by the outcome in swing congressional districts.

Wouldn’t that be lovely.

I’ve ruminated about a multiparty national system with a French-style runoff election. But it’s difficult to envision how to get from what we have to that or any other alternative.

Such visioning needs to start occurring, with some urgency. What we have isn’t working.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

160,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

According to …","How bold is Pete Buttigieg willing to go? Joshua Lott/Getty Images

Pete Buttigieg is having a hard time getting noticed. One month after launching his presidential campaign, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, remains little more than a hard-to-pronounce afterthought in a field that is getting deeper by the week. According to the most recent polling from Morning Consult, 62 percent of Democrats say they’ve never heard of Buttigieg, while nearly half of those who do know his name say they haven’t heard enough to form an opinion. The top-line numbers are more daunting still: Buttigieg polls at 0 percent—as in zero, nada, nothing—among Democrats, both nationally and in the early nominating states.

This problem is not unique to Buttigieg, as everyone from former Rep. John Delaney to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand can attest. The former launched his presidential campaign 18 months ago and, like Buttigieg, fails to crack the margin of error in most national polls. The latter is a powerful senator from New York and yet sits at just 1 percent in the Morning Consult survey and no longer even merits a mention on RealClearPolitics’ 2020 aggregate page that runs nearly a dozen names deep. Everyone outside of the top tier faces the same immediate problem: How do you stand out in a year when the Democratic field is both so deep and so wide?

Buttigieg’s predicament is particularly illustrative. If elected, the former Rhodes scholar and Navy veteran would become both the nation’s youngest president and its first openly gay one, but he’s hardly the only candidate with such history-making potential. In the past, calling for a radical reimagination of the U.S. economy would surely get you noticed; this year, even the self-styled pragmatists in the race are willing to talk about it. Buttigieg is arguably best known for the fact that most everyone mangles his name, but even on that quality he has plenty of competition among the 2020 field.

Buttigieg, though, may have found the tiniest of openings this week—perhaps by accident.

During an event Tuesday in Philadelphia, an audience member asked him whether, if elected, he would be willing to pack the Supreme Court with liberal justices in response to the high court’s recent shift rightward. “I have not reached a considered position on the question of court-packing,” Buttigieg said over a few nervous-sounding laughs in the crowd. “Although I don’t think we should be laughing at it. Because in some ways it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today.”

It was an off-the-cuff, noncommittal answer, and yet it generated small but noticeable excitement in some corners of the internet. The 1/20/21 Project, a court-packing campaign with the backing of people like Harvard law professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet, celebrated the answer, as did NARAL president Ilyse Hogue. Progressive outlets like Common Dreams and Daily Kos likewise reacted positively, and ThinkProgress even went as far as to declare that Buttigieg had proved himself the only Democrat in the race who “seems serious about governing.”

Yes, @PeteButtigieg DID say that he is open to court packing! #PackTheCourts pic.twitter.com/JDJTQajCpu — Pack The Courts (@PackSCOTUS) February 20, 2019

A few tweets and effusive blog posts won’t turn Buttigieg into a national figure, but they do suggest that, even in a field that is proposing bold policies on everything from day care to climate change, there’s still room for a candidate to go big in other, less obvious areas. Buttigieg’s full answer, which didn’t make it into the clip originally shared online, points to a few such directions he might consider:

So, I have not reached a considered position on the question of court-packing—although I don’t think we should be laughing at it. Because in some ways it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today. I will say some of things I have decided I am prepared to advocate for are in the spirit of acknowledging bold reforms are needed—not just getting money out of politics, which we gotta do, not just redistricting, which we gotta do, but things that might require constitutional action, which interestingly, the court-packing would not, but things like, questioning whether it really makes sense to have an Electoral College that twice in my lifetime has overruled the American people. Asking whether it makes sense to continue to go on with fellow American citizens in places like D.C. and Puerto Rico denied full political representation. And the reality is you might not be able to end Citizens United without constitutional action. The reason I think it’s important to bring things up like this—part of this is maybe just a Hoosier streak, that 50 years ago, my home state senator, Birch Bayh, was authoring several constitutional amendments: The 25th amendment, which might come in handy one day, the lowering of the voting age, the Equal Rights Amendment, which sadly did not make it but should have. And we need to set that as the level of intellectual and policy ambition that we have, which does not come naturally to our party lately. So I haven’t reached a considered opinion on that one yet, but I do think very bold, very ambitious ideas deserve a hearing right now.

That’s a long answer bookended by I-have-no-official-position-on-court-packing caveats, but in between Buttigieg brings up the possibility of abolishing the Electoral College and granting statehood to Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

163,Empty,2019-02-25T14:32:08Z,Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC Monday that he would support New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.,"Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he would support fellow billionaire and former three-term New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say I'm for him,"" Buffett told Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" Interview from Omaha, Nebraska. ""I think he would be a very good president.""

Buffett said he's never been a card-carrying Democrat, pointing out that he's voted for Democratic candidates and Republican candidates over the years. He said neither party has an edge on virtue.

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez addressed criticism she has faced from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress at a New York Hall of Science event.

“You know what? I don’t care anymore, because at least I’m trying and they’re not,” she said.

“I just introduced the Green New Deal two weeks ago and it’s creating all of this conversation, why? Because no one else has even tried.”

Her comments came during a discussion with Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani and young women of colour who have designed apps which address social issues.

Critics have claimed the Green New Deal resolution is too extreme and unworkable, with Donald Trump incorrectly suggesting it would “permanently eliminate all planes, cars, cows, oil, gas and the military”.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez added: “So people are like ‘Oh it’s unrealistic, oh it’s vague, oh it doesn’t address this little minute thing’ and I’m like ‘You try! You do it!’ Because you’re not, so until you do it, I’m the boss, How about that?”

The resolution, which has been proposed by Ms Ocasio-Cortez and senator Edward J Markey, sets out broad changes to American society which aim to reduce the effects of climate change.

It includes key goals of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and 100 per cent renewable energy in the US by 2030.

The proposal currently has the support of major Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.

Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she would vote for the non-binding resolution but suggested she would oppose certain elements of the proposal when it came to the details of legislation.

Former vice president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon have also supported the idea in principle.





However, the resolution has faced opposition from fellow Democrats, such as California senator Dianne Feinstein.

Ms Feinstein was recently filmed arguing with a group of school children over the proposal, saying she could not support it because “there’s no way to pay for it”.

“I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing,” she said.

“You come in here and you say it has to be my way or the highway. I don’t respond to that.”

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said he intends to bring forward a vote on the Green New Deal, which would force Democrats to formally decide whether to back the proposal.

The resolution is not expected to pass the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican majority, and the planned vote has been criticised by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as a ""cynical ploy"" to split the party.",Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivers impassioned response to critics: 'I'm the boss.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html

So far it has mostly been used to create altered pornographic clips featuring celebrity women’s faces but once the techniques are perfected, deepfake revenge porn purporting to show people cheating on their partners won’t be far behind.

But more than becoming a nasty tool for stalkers and harassers, deepfakes threaten to undermine trust in political institutions and society as a whole. The White House recently justified temporarily banning a reporter from its press conferences using reportedly sped up genuine footage of an incident involving the journalist. Imagine the implications of seeing ultra-realistic but artificial footage of government leaders planning assassinations, CEOs colluding with foreign agents or a renowned philanthropist abusing children.

So-called fake news has already increased many people’s scepticism towards politicians, journalists and other public figures. It is becoming so easy to create entirely fictional scenarios that we can no longer trust any video footage at face value. This threatens our political, legal and media systems, not to mention our personal relationships. We will need to create new forms of consensus on which to base our social reality. New ways of checking and distributing power – some political, some technological – could help us achieve this.

Fake scandals, fake politicians

Deepfakes are scary because they allow anyone’s image to be co-opted, and call into question our ability to trust what we see. One obvious use of deepfakes would be to falsely implicate people in scandals. Even if the incriminating footage is subsequently proven to be fake, the damage to the victim’s reputation may be impossible to repair. And politicians could tweak old footage of themselves to make it appear as if they had always supported something that had recently become popular, updating their positions in real time.

There could even be public figures who are entirely imaginary, original but not authentic. Meanwhile, video footage could become useless as evidence in court. Broadcast news could be reduced to people debating whether clips were authentic or not, using ever more complex AI to try to detect deepfakes.

But the arms race that already exists between fake content creators and those detecting or debunking disinformation (such as Facebook’s planned fake news “war room”) hides a deeper issue. The mere existence of deepfakes undermines confidence and trust, just as the possibility that an election was hacked brings the validity of the result into question.

While some people may be taken in by deepfakes, that is not the real problem. What is at stake is the underlying social structure in which we all agree that some form of truth exists, and the social realities that are based on this trust. It is not a matter of the end of truth, but the end of the belief in truth – a post-trust society. In the wake of massive disinformation, even honest public figures will be easily ignored or discredited. The traditional organizations that have supported and enabled consensus – government, the press – will no longer be fit for purpose.

Blockchain trust

New laws to regulate the use of deepfakes will be important for people who have damaging videos made of them. But policy and law alone will not save our systems of governance. We will need to develop new forms of consensus, new ways to agree on social situations based on alternative forms of trust.

One approach will be to decentralize trust, so that we no longer need a few institutions to guarantee whether information is genuine and can instead rely on multiple people or organizations with good reputations. One way to do this could be to use blockchain, the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain works by creating a public ledger stored on multiple computers around the world at once and made tamper-proof by cryptography. Its algorithms enable the computers to agree on the validity of any changes to the ledger, making it much harder to record false information. In this way, trust is distributed between all the computers who can scrutinize each other, increasing accountability.

More democratic society

We can also look to more democratic forms of government and journalism. For example, liquid democracy allows voters to vote directly on each issue or temporarily assign their votes to delegates in a more flexible and accountable way than handing over full control to one party for years. This would allow the public to look to experts to make decisions for them where necessary but swiftly vote out politicians who disregarded their views or acted dishonestly, increasing trust and legitimacy in the political system.

In the press, we could move towards more collaborative and democratized news reporting. Traditional journalists could use the positive aspects of social media to gather information from a more diverse range of sources. These contributors could then discuss and help scrutinisz the story to build a consensus, improving the media’s reputation.

The problem with any system that relies on the reputation of key individuals to build trust is how to prevent that reputation from being misused or fraudulently damaged. Checks such as Twitter’s “blue tick” account verification for public figures can help, but better legal and technical protections are also needed: more protected rights to privacy, better responses to antisocial behavior online, and better privacy-enhancing technologies built in by design.

The potential ramifications of deepfakes should act as a call to action in redesigning systems of trust to be more open, more decentralized and more collective. And now is the time to start thinking about a different future for society.

167,Empty,2019-02-22T17:58:53Z,"Republicans in Utah, Michigan, Wisconsin and elsewhere didn't like what voters chose last year, so they're simply undoing it.","Last Election Day, 555,651 Utahns ― 53 percent of voters ― backed a measure to expand Medicaid to low-income adults in the state. Last Monday, 79 Republicans made it clear they don’t care what those voters wanted.

All but four GOP members of the Utah legislature voted to repeal the voter-approved initiative and replace it with a more limited plan. Their plan will cover an estimated 90,000 people instead of the approximately 150,000 who would have received health benefits under the ballot initiative. This action came soon after the Utah legislature also weakened a voter-backed policy allowing the use of medical marijuana in the state.

Republican state legislators voted to pass the final version of the Medicaid bill last Monday, and Gov. Gary Herbert (R) signed it hours later. Though Utah Republicans backed away from an earlier version of the legislation that could have resulted in no expansion at all, they nevertheless decided to overturn the will of their constituents almost immediately after convening for the 2019 legislative session.

Citizen activists who spent countless hours knocking on doors and gathering signatures to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot in Utah are, unsurprisingly, upset, said Chase Thomas, the executive director of Alliance for a Better Utah, a Salt Lake City-based government watchdog group. The organization was among the many in the state that endorsed the Medicaid expansion and participated in the campaign to get it before the voters.

“It’s been all over our Facebook page, our Twitter: People saying, ‘How does my vote even matter if they’re allowed to do this?’ saying, ‘What’s the point?’” Thomas said. “That’s completely understandable. I even feel that way, like, why even have an initiative process if the legislature’s allowed to gut it right afterwards?”

This sort of thing is becoming a habit for Republicans when elections don’t go their way.

As events in Utah demonstrate, elected Republicans don’t always let voters have the last word. And what’s happening in the Beehive State is part of a pattern for Republican elected officials across the country, a pattern that also includes changing the rules when members of their party lose elections, which has included erecting barriers to voting and other anti-democratic measures.

It all amounts to a sustained campaign by one of the nation’s two major political parties to shield itself from citizens, entrench its own power and use every tool at its disposal to disenfranchise the rival party and its voters.

The action in Utah came after the state legislature hemmed and hawed about Medicaid expansion for years without resolving the question. In Utah and four other states in 2017 and 2018, hundreds of volunteer and paid canvassers, supported by state and national political and business organizations, took matters into their own hands in response to inaction by state policymakers and organized campaigns to make change via the ballot.

Voters did the rest, approving Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah last year, following a successful campaign in Maine in 2017. A similar Medicaid expansion initiative failed in Montana last year.",The GOP Keeps Changing The Rules After It Loses Elections,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-gop-keeps-changing-the-rules-after-it-loses-elections_n_5c6f0cede4b0f40774cd7232
168,Empty,2019-02-25T19:33:38Z,Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are trying something different.,"Barack Obama before attending fundraisers in 2012. (AP Photo/David Tulis)

Wealthy donors were a big part of how Barack Obama became president. Employees of Goldman Sachs were rivaled only by those of the University of California in powering his record-breaking fundraising totals in 2008. As the insurgent candidate wrestled control of the Democratic Party from the establishment—including frontrunner Hillary Clinton—that year, his inspiring speeches and consistent opposition to the Iraq War were obviously defining elements of a historic candidacy. But so were the eye-popping donations. He broke and then broke again the records for fundraising in a given month, setting the tone for the general election against John McCain with a $66 million haul in August of that year. And while small-dollar donors and the activist base they symbolized were instrumental in his success, Obama also glad-handed at plenty of fancy, exclusive receptions for rich donors both during and after his 2008 victory.

For Democrats hoping to follow in his footsteps, that path toward victory now looks a lot less appealing.

When Bernie Sanders ran for president four years ago, he made a point of largely shunning traditional high-dollar fundraisers, insisting he didn't need or want billionaires' money. It also might have been true that he couldn't get it: The self-declared democratic socialist from Vermont wanted to break up big banks like Goldman, hike taxes on the rich, and dismantle some of the late capitalist infrastructure that he argued was behind soaring income inequality and a broken, for-profit healthcare system. Sanders actually did have the occasional supporter on Wall Street, but with populist anger at Obama's failure to prosecute bankers behind the financial crisis still raging, and the lingering effects of the mortgage crisis and Great Recession still tangible, Sanders could forgo the most lucrative fundraising events and rely on a steady stream of mostly online support from fans. That strategy already seems to be panning out for him this go-around: Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 candidacy last week.

Now Elizabeth Warren is making a point of joining him on the high road. As the New York Times reported Monday, the 2020 contender announced she would skip private, VIP-style fundraisers. She also plans to avoid the ""call time,"" the term for the common practice of politicians working the phones to plead for money from rich people.

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren said in an email to her fans. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.""

This makes sense given that Warren has for years positioned herself as opponent of the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street.

""Her ceasing VIP fundraisers with mega donors is consistent with the messaging she's been using in campaign, and at this early point in the race, the energy is focused on generating excitement from the base and distinguishing each candidate's campaign from the rest of the pack,"" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the influence watchdog the Center for Responsive Politics.

As Krumholz noted, it's also fair to assume she isn't actually passing on all that much money here; the party's wealthiest donors might be predisposed to back, say, Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Cory Booker, or (if and when he gets in) Joe Biden. All of them have been dinged by the left for relatively neoliberal stances on some issues, even if they have also inched leftward and embraced policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal to stay abreast of activist orthodoxy. (Gillibrand also declared she wasn't going to take money from corporate PACs, though she'll apparently still take money from individuals connected to the finance industry.)

Which brings us to what this is really about: Warren is sending a message, like the one Sanders has been sending for years now, to the party's most engaged partisans. After all, her move came just a week after the Times reported that a coterie of her rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, and Cory Booker, ""auditioned"" before super-wealthy Obama donors, hoping to win their support.

It remains to be seen how much the larger universe of Democratic voters actually cares about who a candidate's donors are. But polling for years now has tended to find large majorities of Americans think the government is too focused on the needs of the rich and not enough on the poor and middle-class, and that money holds too much sway in their democracy.

Warren and Sanders are helping lay down a marker for their competitors, who will have to defend their own practices of holding fundraisers and taking money from industries the Democratic base isn't a fan of. Fundraising has been a consistent issue among those involved in Democratic politics, with a contentious fight over donations from the oil and gas industry unfolding last year in the Democratic National Committee. (The DNC ultimately decided to accept such donations.) In 2008, Obama made a show of skipping out on corporate PAC and lobbyist money, though he obviously wasn't actually missing out on all that much. In 2016, Clinton seemed to be on the side of accepting donations from anyone who would give them, leading to attacks from Trump about her family foundation's work and her paid speeches before audiences of bankers—even as he soaked up dark money donations from self-interested financial titans.

Whether Trump's attacks were fair, this time around the Democratic nominee may be someone who rejects the whole system of donors that Clinton was enmeshed in. If nothing else, the party is set for a real debate—with Warren and Sanders in particular poised to pressure their rivals—about who gets a voice in their government, and how much that voice costs them.

""It's a battle,"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, VICE contributor, and critic of the party's coziness with entrenched financial power, said in an email when I asked if Warren's move meant Obama donors were losing control of the party. ""To paraphrase Churchill: It isn't the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.""

From her ‘Green New Deal’ proposal to combat climate change to her clapbacks against Trump and her critics, here’s how AOC danced her way into the spotlight. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took on what her life could be like in another world, in another time where Donald Trump was not the president.

While appearing on the premiere of Showtime's new talk show ""Desus & Mero,"" Ocasio-Cortez was asked what she would have done if she hadn't decided to run for Congress, joining a large pool of women who ran in the midterms in direct response to Trump winning the 2016 election.

Mero asked if Trump hadn't become president, ""would you have run for Congress?""

""I don’t know!"" Ocasio-Cortez told the pair. ""I could just be like teaching in high school right now.""

She continued: ""But you know, times of great challenge can also bring out the best in people, too, and so I think that's what we're really seeing, even though things are hitting the fan right now, we're seeing people activate and educate themselves.""

Before running for Congress in New York's 14th district and beating out 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley, Ocasio-Cortez worked as a bartender at a restaurant. Her upset victory against Crowley gained national attention and put Ocasio-Cortez and some of her socialist policies, including a large hike in taxes on the wealthy and an ambitious idea to fight climate change, in the limelight.

Republicans have denounced the policies as radical and repeatedly pointed to socialist countries like Venezuela, which are failing and corrupt. They have pointed out the high taxpayer cost for her policies, including Medicare for All, and said her ideas seem to a glimpse at the future of the Democratic party.

Ocasio-Cortez was also asked about all that attention, especially from conservatives, and took on all the hate, trolls and memes that seem to follow nearly every one of her social media posts.

Desus pointed out that after they posted on Twitter about her appearance on the show, they also were exposed to the intense level of hate she gets on a daily basis and asked, when that stuff happens, do you regret getting into politics?""

""No, no. I mean it is heavy but in a weird way that stuff is validation that you're doing something real,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Because if you're just flying under the radar, just trying to like get your check, like not rock the boat, then what's the point of being in politics?""

She also joined the hosts in making fun of some of the memes that are often sent to her, dubbing them ""so weak.""

""It's like how do you have a computer that runs both Windows 95 and Twitter at the same time?"" she said, sparking laughs in the audience.

Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, said on Friday he was appalled at the treatment of Jewish legislators who had taken a stand against anti-Semitism and that the ""the party is tougher on the people complaining about anti-Semitism than it is on the anti-Semites"".

The party was ""broken"" and had been taken over by the ""hard left"", he told the Express & Star newspaper.

""The Labour Party has been my life, so this has been the hardest decision I have ever had to take, but I have to be honest and the truth is that I have become ashamed of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.""

Labour has been dogged by allegations the party has become hostile to Jews under Corbyn, a long-time supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, despite him repeatedly stating anti-Semitism has no place in the party.

A Labour spokesman said the party regretted that Austin had decided to leave.

""He was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament and so the democratic thing is to resign his seat and let the people of Dudley decide who should represent them,"" he said.

Austin said he was not joining eight other former Labour MPs and three Conservatives who this week formed the centrist Independent Group.

The Conservative rebels cited opposition to what they see as their party's increasingly hardline euroscepticism for their departures, while the Labour MPs blamed quitting on both its Brexit policy and its anti-Semitism issues.

The group hopes to gain members from disgruntled pro-Europeans in both Labour and Conservative parties and forge a new force at the centre of British politics.

Here's why. USA TODAY

New Jersey Democrats are reviving a controversial effort to force President Donald Trump to release his tax returns or be denied a spot on the state's 2020 ballot.

The state Senate on Thursday approved a bill — which the Legislature passed once before, in 2017, but which then-Gov. Chris Christie blocked by issuing a scathing veto — that would prohibit candidates for president and vice president from appearing on the ballot unless they make their tax returns public.

Similar legislation has been introduced in at least 30 states but never enacted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, meaning New Jersey would be the first to impose such a disclosure requirement if its measure is also approved by the Assembly and signed by Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

A spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, D-Middlesex, said the speaker would consult with his caucus about holding votes on the bill. Murphy’s office declined to comment when asked about the governor's position on the measure.

New Jersey's bill and the others like it, introduced in most cases by Democratic lawmakers angered by Trump's refusal to disclose information about his personal finances, have touched off a heated national debate over the constitutionality and appropriateness of such a law.

Supporters say states have room under the U.S. Constitution to create ballot access requirements and argue that voters should be able to review candidates’ tax returns in deciding whom to send to the White House.

“It is so obvious with this president that had voters known some of what seem to be his business interests, he may not have been elected president,” said state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, a sponsor of the bill.

But critics say such a measure would be struck down by the courts and could lead to more demands on candidates in the future.

“Today we require tax returns, but what would be next?” former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat, wrote in vetoing a similar measure in his state in 2017, according to The Associated Press. “Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?”

“It’s just political pandering,” said John Carbone, an attorney specializing in election law at the Ridgewood firm Carbone & Faasse.

“They can impose no requirements for a candidate for federal office, let alone president,” Carbone added, referring to state lawmakers. “They’re thinking like Alabama Democrats during the Civil War: What can we do to get Lincoln?”

Trump’s tax returns have been a target of his opponents since the 2016 campaign. Trump, a Republican, broke with decades of precedent in refusing to release his taxes and has cited a “continuous” IRS audit when challenged on his insistence on withholding them.

Although they are not required to do so by law, presidential candidates in the past have released their tax returns as a matter of transparency so voters could learn about their financial status, business dealings and potential conflicts of interest.

Democrats who now control the U.S. House of Representatives are reportedly studying a century-old provision in the federal tax code to gain access to Trump’s tax returns and make them public. Separately, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, has introduced legislation to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their 10 most recent federal income tax returns.

The Democrats who control New Jersey’s Legislature are eyeing a different mechanism to force the disclosure, threatening to keep off the New Jersey ballot any candidate who does not share his or her five most recent tax returns at least 50 days before the 2020 general election.

The bill, S-119, would also prohibit New Jersey electors from voting for a non-compliant presidential or vice presidential candidate as part of the Electoral College process after a general election.

Whether that would hurt Trump is another story: New Jersey has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.

Thursday's vote in the Senate was 23-11 and fell largely along party lines. One Democrat, Sen. Bob Andrzejczak of Cape May County, was opposed, while one Republican, Sen. Kip Bateman of Somerset County, was in favor.

The bill must still be approved by an Assembly committee and the full chamber before it can head to the governor's desk for final approval or a veto.

In his veto message in 2017, Christie, a Republican, blasted an earlier version of the bill as a “transparent political stunt” and said if lawmakers were really concerned about transparency, they would end the disclosure exemption for legislative records under the state’s Open Public Records Act. Democrats did not take Christie up on his suggestion.

In a similar spirit, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio, R-Morris, sought to amend the latest bill during Thursday’s Senate voting session to make it apply to all gubernatorial, state Senate and Assembly candidates as well as presidential and vice presidential candidates.

“What’s good for the goose is what’s good for the gander,” Pennacchio said in a statement explaining the move. “If this really is about making sure voters are well-informed, then common sense dictates that S-119 should apply to all of us.”

Democrats blocked the amendments.

172,Empty,2019-02-22T10:00:00Z,The Bulwark is on a mission to name and shame President Trump's most high-status supporters.,"Sykes admits that some of these early targets have constituted “low-hanging fruit.” But in the coming months, he tells me, The Bulwark will home in on a specific class of “grifters and trolls”—those opportunistic Trump enablers who still get invited on Meet the Press and write for prestigious newspapers. To Sykes, these are the true sellouts, and he wants to ensure that their public flirtations with Trumpism leave a stench on them.

“A lot of folks have had a free shot to get in bed with some of the most disreputable [people] out there, and they still have a veneer of respectability,” Sykes says. “We want to raise the opportunity cost.”

Asked for examples of prospective targets, Sykes doesn’t have to think long before rattling off a list of high-status commentators (Marc Thiessen, Hugh Hewitt), think tankers (Henry Olsen, Victor Davis Hanson), and politicos (Bill Bennett).

“The Sean Hannitys to me are not that offensive,” Sykes says of the Fox News Trump booster. “Because Sean Hannity is dumb as a box of rocks—he doesn’t know any better.” (Through a spokesperson, Hannity responded, “If Charlie and the rest of the sore-loser, establishment Never Trumpers had their way, Hillary would be president … I wish them well supporting the next radical socialist that runs for president.”)

Sykes says he is much more bothered by the writers and thinkers he used to respect—and he holds out hope that they can still be “salvaged.”

“This sounds naive, but I quite frankly feel they know better,” he tells me. “And at certain points of moral clarity, I could see them coming back to the faith of their fathers.”

Yet when I ask if he really believes The Bulwark’s coverage could be the catalyst that leads them back to the light, Sykes seems to second-guess himself.

“For me to think I’m going to psychologically change them … ” he pauses, and then shrugs wearily. “I don’t know. They may double down.”

Originally, The Bulwark was meant to be a simple news aggregator, a sort of Never Trump Drudge Report that compiled headlines and links from around the web. But that changed in December, when The Weekly Standard—the venerable conservative magazine that had emerged as a leading voice of the anti-Trump right—was abruptly shut down. Phil Anschutz, the Republican billionaire who owned the publication, had reportedly grown frustrated with its constant needling of the president.

Recognizing a void left in the conservative-media landscape, the Standard co-founder Bill Kristol—who had tried unsuccessfully to save the magazine—charged Sykes and a handful of laid-off writers and editors with beefing up The Bulwark with original content.

Kristol told me that he didn’t want to build a “Weekly Standard 2.0.” For all its esteem, it also carried a certain amount of baggage. “I think being a fresh upstart website, and not a magazine with years of relationships, has been a real asset,” he said. “At The Weekly Standard, we didn’t want to look like we were sniping too much at individuals … We didn’t want to waste our readers’ time worrying about various grifters. We liked to think we were publishing more important stuff.” In retrospect, Kristol conceded, “that may have been a mistake.”",The New Outlaws of Conservative Media,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/bulwarks-quest-shame-high-profile-trump-backers/583354/

Donna Shalala (D-FL) tells Politico","Florida Democrats are condemning Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for refusing to call Venezuela's socialist President Nicolás Maduro a dictator.

Sanders, the self-described ""democratic socialist,"" has not revealed whether he considers Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the nation's interim president, which is the view of the U.S. and a host of European and Latin American countries.

Florida Democrats, according to new report from Politico, believe that Sanders' position will benefit President Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the Sunshine State. The president held a rally in Miami on Monday, where he denounced Maduro and socialism, in an attempt to appeal to the state's Venezuelan-American voters heading into the 2020 election. As Politico noted, many Venezuelans, who have experienced socialism first-hand, have moved to Florida as the country's economic and humanitarian turmoil worsened under Maduro.

Following Trump's Monday event, Democrats in Florida have expressed concern that Trump's attempt to solidify his Latino support could help him grab support from an otherwise-reliable Democratic voting block in the country's biggest swing state, where presidential races have been famously decided by razor-thin margins. They were quick to reject Sanders' comments.

""He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,"" Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles, told Politico. ""I absolutely disagree with his imprecision in not saying Maduro must go."" (Shalala formerly served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Bill Clinton.)

Sanders did not embrace Maduro in his Tuesday interview with Univision's Jorge Ramos, who mentioned Guaidó being declared the interim president of Venezuela by the country's National Assembly following Maduro's contested election. However, when the Vermont Independent was asked whether he recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader of the country, he answered, ""No.""

""There are serious questions about the recent election,"" Sanders added. ""There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election.""

In a follow-up question, Ramos asked Sanders if he thought Maduro was a dictator who should step down. Sanders would not answer either ""yes"" or ""no.""

""I think clearly he has been very, very abusive,"" Sanders replied. ""That is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there's got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America, as you recall, whether it was Chile, or Brazil, or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.""

Sanders added that he believes ""the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela.""

Meanwhile, Florida's Democratic Party has made its position on Maduro clear.

""Florida Democrats have been unequivocal: We recognize Juan Guaidó as the President of Venezuela, denounce the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and his efforts to remain illegally in power,"" the group said in a statement.

Christian Ulvert, one of the state's top Democratic consultants for Hispanic outreach, called Sanders comments ""extremely ignorant"" in an interview with Politico. He reportedly wrote to the Democratic National Committee chairman concerning the location of the party's 2020 presidential convention, noting that Trump was trying to make strides with South Florida's Hispanic community with his anti-socialism message, while Sanders was muddling that message.

""This helps Trump and it makes our job harder as Democrats,"" Ulvert said, according to Politico. ""What this will do is whip into a frenzy South Florida’s Hispanic community on both sides of the aisle. It’s an unnecessary distraction.""

The U.S. was the first to recognize Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela last month – and has suggested that it could use military force to ensure aid delivery or protect U.S. business interests. About 64 other nations have followed the U.S. in supporting Guaidó. The United Nations continues to recognize Maduro, although it has called for talks, as roughly 50-member nations have vowed to support Maduro, including U.S. political foes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Syria.

The issue has entered the 2020 Democratic primary for president, with most candidates revealing their positions.

Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland have affirmed their support of Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said ""Maduro is obviously a dictator"" and suggested she approved of the ""diplomatic part"" of Trump's support of Guaidó, although she criticized his ""saber rattling."" And Hawaii's Democratic Congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said the U.S. should not ""go in and choose who should be the leader of Venezuela. That is not something that serves the interests of the Venezuelan people.""

South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio did not reveal their views on recognizing Guaidó but called for free and fair elections in Venezuela. Sen.

In January, Greece ratified an agreement with the newly renamed Republic of North Macedonia. There are some who argue this is the first step towards recognising the existence of a Macedonian language and ethnicity - and yet Greece has denied the existence of its own Macedonian minority for decades, says Maria Margaronis. Will something now change?

Mr Fokas, 92, stands straight as a spear in his tan leather brogues and cream blazer, barely leaning on the ebony and ivory cane brought from Romania by his grandfather a century ago. His mind and his memory are as sharp as his outfit.

A retired lawyer, Mr Fokas speaks impeccable formal Greek with a distinctive lilt: his mother tongue is Macedonian, a Slavic language related to Bulgarian and spoken in this part of the Balkans for centuries. At his son's modern house in a village in northern Greece, he takes me through the painful history of Greece's unrecognised Slavic-speaking minority.

Mr Fokas takes care to emphasise from the start that he is both an ethnic Macedonian and a Greek patriot. He has good reason to underline his loyalty: for almost a century, ethnic Macedonians in Greece have been objects of suspicion and, at times, persecution, even as their presence has been denied by almost everyone.

Most are reluctant to speak to outsiders about their identity. To themselves and others, they're known simply as ""locals"" (dopyi), who speak a language called ""local"" (dopya). They are entirely absent from school history textbooks, have not featured in censuses since 1951 (when they were only patchily recorded, and referred to simply as ""Slavic-speakers""), and are barely mentioned in public. Most Greeks don't even know that they exist.

That erasure was one reason for Greece's long-running dispute with the former Yugoslav republic now officially called the Republic of North Macedonia. The dispute was finally resolved last month by a vote in the Greek parliament ratifying (by a majority of just seven) an agreement made last June by the countries' two prime ministers. When the Greek Prime Minster, Alexis Tsipras, referred during the parliamentary debate to the existence of ""Slavomacedonians"" in Greece - at the time of World War Two - he was breaking a long-standing taboo.

The use of the name ""Macedonia"" by the neighbouring nation state implicitly acknowledges that Macedonians are a people in their own right, and opens the door to hard questions about the history of Greece's own Macedonian minority.

When Mr Fokas was born, the northern Greek region of Macedonia had only recently been annexed by the Greek state. Until 1913 it was part of the Ottoman Empire, with Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia all wooing its Slavic-speaking inhabitants as a means to claiming the territory. It was partly in reaction to those competing forces that a distinctive Slav Macedonian identity emerged in the late 19th and early 20th Century. As Mr Fokas's uncle used to say, the family was ""neither Serb, nor Greek, nor Bulgarian, but Macedonian Orthodox"".

In the end, the Slav Macedonians found themselves divided between those three new states. In Greece, some were expelled; those who remained were pushed to assimilate. All villages and towns with non-Greek names were given new ones, chosen by a committee of scholars in the late 1920s, though almost a century later some ""locals"" still use the old ones.

In 1936, when Mr Fokas was nine years old, the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas (an admirer of Mussolini) banned the Macedonian language, and forced Macedonian-speakers to change their names to Greek ones.

Mr Fokas remembers policemen eavesdropping on mourners at funerals and listening at windows to catch anyone speaking or singing in the forbidden tongue. There were lawsuits, threats and beatings.

Women - who often spoke no Greek - would cover their mouths with their headscarves to muffle their speech, but Mr Fokas's mother was arrested and fined 250 drachmas, a big sum back then.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Macedonian villagers in Greece in 1947

""Slavic-speakers suffered a lot from the Greeks under Metaxas,"" he says. ""Twenty people from this village, the heads of the big families, were exiled to the island of Chios. My father-in-law was one of them."" They were tortured by being forced to drink castor oil, a powerful laxative.

When Germany, Italy and Bulgaria invaded Greece in 1941, some Slavic-speakers welcomed the Bulgarians as potential liberators from Metaxas's repressive regime. But many soon joined the resistance, led by the Communist Party (which at that time supported the Macedonian minority) and continued fighting with the Communists in the civil war that followed the Axis occupation. (Bulgaria annexed the eastern part of Greek Macedonia from 1941 to 1944, committing many atrocities; many Greeks wrongly attribute these to Macedonians, whom they identify as Bulgarians.)

When the Communists were finally defeated, severe reprisals followed for anyone associated with the resistance or the left.

""Macedonians paid more than anyone for the civil war,"" Mr Fokas says. ""Eight people were court-martialled and executed from this village, eight from the next village, 23 from the one opposite. They killed a grandfather and his grandson, just 18 years old.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Greek protester wears a Balkan War uniform to oppose the agreement on ""North Macedonia""

Mr Fokas was a student in Thessaloniki then - but he too was arrested and spent three years on the prison island of Makronisos, not because of anything he'd done but because his mother had helped her brother-in-law escape through the skylight of a cafe where he was being held.

Most of the prisoners on Makronisos were Greek leftists, and were pressed to sign declarations of repentance for their alleged Communist past. Those who refused were made to crawl under barbed wire, or beaten with thick bamboo canes. ""Terrible things were done,"" Mr Fokas says. ""But we mustn't talk about them. It's an insult to Greek civilisation. It harms Greece's good name.""

Tens of thousands of fighters with the Democratic Army, about half of them Slavic-speakers, went into exile in Eastern bloc countries during and after the civil war. About 20,000 children were taken across the border by the Communists, whether for their protection or as reserve troops for a future counter-attack.

Many Slavic-speaking civilians also went north for safety. Entire villages were left empty, like the old settlement of Krystallopigi (Smrdes in Macedonian) near the Albanian border, where only the imposing church of St George stands witness to a population that once numbered more than 1,500 souls.

In 1982, more than 30 years after the conflict's end, Greece's socialist government issued a decree allowing civil war refugees to return - but only those who were ""of Greek ethnicity"". Ethnic Macedonians from Greece remained shut out of their country, their villages and their land; families separated by the war were never reunited.

Mr Fokas's father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in Skopje. But, he points out, that decree tacitly recognised that there were ethnic Macedonians in Greece, even though the state never officially recognised their existence: ""Those war refugees left children, grandchildren, fathers, mothers behind. What were they, if not Macedonians?""

It's impossible accurately to calculate the number of Slavic-speakers or descendants of ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Historian Leonidas Embiricos estimates that more than 100,000 still live in the Greek region of Macedonia, though only 10,000 to 20,000 would identify openly as members of a minority - and many others are proud Greek nationalists.

The Macedonian language hasn't officially been banned in Greece for decades, but the fear still lingers. A middle-aged man I met in a village near the reed beds of Lake Prespa, where the agreement between Greece and the North Macedonian republic was first signed last June, explained that this fear is passed down through the generations. ""My parents didn't speak the language at home in case I picked it up and spoke it in public. To protect me. We don't even remember why we're afraid any more,"" he said. Slowly the language is dying. Years of repression pushed it indoors; assimilation is finishing the job.

And yet speaking or singing in Macedonian can still be cause for harassment. Mr Fokas's son is a musician; he plays the haunting Macedonian flute for us as his own small son looks on. He and a group of friends used to host an international music festival in the village square, with bands from as far away as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.

""After those bands had played we'd have a party and play Macedonian songs,"" he says. ""None of them were nationalist or separatist songs - we would never allow that. But in 2008, just as we were expecting the foreign musicians to arrive, the local authority suddenly banned us from holding the festival in the square, even though other people - the very ones who wanted us banned - still hold their own events there.""

Greece's position

The Greek government officially recognises only one minority - the Muslim minority of Thrace

It has historically regarded the Macedonian Slavs of Greek Macedonia as a linguistic rather than a national group, referring to them as Slavophone Greeks or bilingual Greeks

A document issued in the early 1990s, says that ""almost all the bilingual inhabitants of the area whose national consciousness was not Greek moved to neighbouring states"" in the first half of the 20th Century - by implication, any bilingual people who remained possessed Greek national consciousness

The Prespa agreement says the nationality of the people of North Macedonia is ""Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia"" - which, as the Greek government emphasises, makes no presumption about the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity

At the last minute, the festival was moved to a field outside the village, among the reeds and marshes, without proper facilities - which, Mr Fokas's son points out, only made Greece look bad.

""And do you know why the songs are banned in the square but not the fields outside?"" his father adds. ""Because around the square there are cafes, and local people could sit there and watch and listen secretly. But outside the village they were afraid to join in - they would have drawn attention to themselves by doing that.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests against the agreement on the name of North Macedonia became violent

The ratification of Greece's agreement with the Republic of North Macedonia - and, as some argue, its implicit recognition of a Macedonian language and ethnicity - is a major political breakthrough which should help to alleviate such fears. But the process has also sparked new waves of anger and anxiety, with large, sometimes violent protests opposing the agreement, supported by parts of the Orthodox church.

An election is due before the end of the year. Greece's right-wing opposition has been quick to capitalise on nationalist sentiments, accusing the Syriza government of treason and betrayal. For Greece's Slavic-speakers, who have long sought nothing more than the right to cultural expression, the time to emerge from the shadows may not quite yet have arrived.

President Donald Trump on Friday blamed the “radical left” for Amazon’s decision last week to pull out of its plan to build a second headquarters in New York, calling it a “big loss” for his hometown.

“I think if you look at the deal, the deal was not a great deal from the standpoint of they could have made a better deal than that — a much better deal — but still, I think it's a loss to New York City,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump has had his fair share of brush-ups with Amazon, frequently attacking the company and its founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.

Amazon last week announced that it would no longer go forward with its so-called HQ2 project in Queens after liberal activists charged the development would exacerbate economic disparities in the area and decried Amazon’s aversion to employing union-backed workers.

Freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became a poster child for the deal’s opposition, arguing that Amazon received too many incentives as part of the deal, which would have created 25,000 jobs.

She’s been criticized for saying that there were better ways for New York to invest the $3 billion in tax breaks Amazon would’ve received for the project, with many pointing out that amount was not equivalent to the state handing over a check.

Trump repeated that criticism Friday, taking the opportunity to bash the Democratic Party as a whole, despite the collapse of the deal splintering state party officials.

“The $3 billion wasn't a check. It was a form of taxes over a period of time that now they'll never see,” he said. “They were going to take in a lot of jobs, take in a lot of taxes. So I think it's a big loss for New York City. It's the kind of thinking that our country is going to on the left, on the radical left, but ultimately it's not good for jobs and it's not good for the economy.”

He added: “I come from New York City. I love New York City. I think it was a big loss for New York City.”

Bernie Sanders jumps into the race, raises $6 million and immediately mixes it up with the president.","Welcome to 2020 Vision, the new Yahoo News column covering the presidential race. Reminder: There are 348 days until the Iowa caucuses, and 619 days until the 2020 presidential election.

It was a big week for Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent senator formally launched his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign on Monday. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign said it raised nearly $6 million in its first 24 hours, or roughly four times as much as Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign’s much-heralded launch.

The same day, the Daily Beast reported that Sanders had hired Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, to serve as his campaign manager. “Shakir, 39, is almost certainly the first campaign manager of a major presidential campaign who identifies as a Muslim,” the Daily Beast noted.

Jeff Weaver, Sanders’s 2016 campaign manager and longtime friend, had been eyeing a different role for Sanders’s second run and will likely serve as a senior adviser.

Then on Thursday, Sanders announced his campaign’s four national co-chairs, who together with Shakir fill out a diversity full house: former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Ben Cohen.

“To win this election and build a movement to defeat Donald Trump, we must bring together a team prepared to fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice,” Sanders said. “And that’s exactly what Nina, Ro, Carmen and Ben have been doing their entire lives.”

But Sanders wasn’t the only 2020 candidate to make staffing moves this week. Harris named three women of color to her presidential campaign: Emmy Ruiz, who served as Barack Obama’s Nevada state director in 2012 and Hillary Clinton’s state director in Nevada and Colorado in 2016, to be a senior adviser; Missayr Boker, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s director in 2018; and Julie Chávez Rodriguez, granddaughter of civil rights leader Cesar Chávez. The women will serve as Harris’s national political co-directors.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign named its communications team, tapping veteran GOP operative Tim Murtaugh as communications director; Mark Lotter, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, as director of strategic communications; and Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany as national press secretary.

McEnany’s first task? Issuing the Trump campaign’s official response to Bernie Sanders joining the 2020 field.

Trump’s ‘robust’ primary challenge

President Trump may be happy to handicap the 2020 Democratic presidential field, but there’s been a lot of talk in recent days of a possible Republican primary challenge — the first serious one to a sitting president since Ted Kennedy tried to wrest the Democratic nomination from President Jimmy Carter in 1980.

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Yahoo News’ Alex Nazaryan that he believes Trump will face a “robust challenge” for the GOP nomination. And that, Steele said, is as it should be.","2020 Vision: Bernie Sanders launches, like a rocket",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/2020-vision-bernie-sanders-launches-like-rocket-192320064.html

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced his first ever presidential run, more than three-quarters of the electorate had no idea who he was.

Sanders, of course, went on to give former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the 2016 Democratic party primaries. His rallies attracted both enormous crowds and a healthy supply of young voters, for whom he articulated — in a thick Brooklyn accent — a vision of a government that he said would work for everybody, not just millionaires and billionaires.

Four years later and after much speculation, Sanders announced he is officially entering the 2020 Democratic primary. Now, according to Gallup, he is the rare candidate who is almost universally known.

In the time between these two primary seasons, much ink has been spilled in the service of chronicling the way Sanders has transformed the Democratic Party, where the key policy ideas of his 2016 run — such as Medicare for All, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage — have become more widely embraced and more deeply rooted among its members. Much less attention had been paid, however, to the way that 2016 race has transformed Sanders.

But people close to Sanders say that in the past few years, the senator has endeavored to learn from his first foray into presidential politics. He has begun to think more about racial justice and its connections to his economic message. He’s become much more comfortable with the daily work of campaigning and has bought into the value of polling. Moreover, he’s spent a considerable amount of time building bridges with longtime political operatives and activists outside of his inner circle, they say.

The 2016 campaign, as one former aide told ThinkProgress, was like “putting the plane together as we flew.” This year the campaign won’t be as improvisatory. Rather, there will be a comprehensive plan that runs “through Iowa, beyond New Hampshire, past Super Tuesday, all the way until the general election,” said the former aide, who, like several others, requested anonymity to speak freely about Sanders. The Sanders campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

One sign of Sanders’ growth as a candidate is his selection of Faiz Shakir to serve as campaign manager, said former aides and advisers. Hiring Shakir, who most recently was national politics director for the American Civil Liberties Union and previously was the editor of ThinkProgress, demonstrates a fresh dedication to a more expansive campaign platform and a more diverse team than in 2016, they said.

The early going hasn’t been free of stumbles, however. Sanders, in an interview with Vermont Public Radio on Tuesday, rankled many progressive activists and former Clinton backers when he said, “We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age. I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.”

Sanders has also had to provide assurances that his rebooted campaign will be more professionally structured after a number of former staffers came forward with allegations of sexual harassment at the hands of a top Sanders staffer during the 2016 campaign. In the wake of the allegations, Sanders went on CNN in January promising to “do better next time.” To that end, he announced that his 2020 campaign would have strict rules to prevent workplace harassment.

“We are going to have the strongest protocols to protect women and anybody else against any form of harassment,” he told CBS. “We are going to be training every employee who works for us, and we’re going to give people who feel they’ve been harassed the opportunity to talk to people outside of the campaign.”

One adviser told ThinkProgress that Sanders recently offered an apology to to members of his inner circle for the way he micromanaged certain aspects of the 2016 campaign. That adviser said the candidate has grown more open to listening, particularly on issues like race.

Sanders has changed in other ways, according to former aides. For instance, he used to bristle at having to discuss polling but now sees its value. And he has worked hard to sharpen his foreign-policy chops — an area in which he repeatedly stumbled in 2016 debates — and plans to articulate an expansive, progressive worldview, one former aide said.

That change is apparent in these early days of Sanders’ campaign. While his 2016 campaign website did not even have a foreign policy section, Sanders went so far as to touch on foreign policy in his presidential announcement, touting his work to end the United States’ involvement in Yemen.

Perhaps the starkest difference between Sanders’ first presidential campaign and this one comes in the form of money: In the 24 hours after his announcement, he raised close to $6 million, blowing his early rivals for the Democratic nomination out of the water. Not only does the initial cash haul demonstrate Sanders’ overwhelming name recognition, it demonstrates that he’s an immediate contender, rather than the dark-horse candidate he was last time around.

But for those close to Sanders — and for many of his most ardent supporters — the most exciting aspect of his entrance into the 2020 race are all the things that will stay the same. And they’re hopeful that despite Sanders’ elevation in the pecking order, he will continue to play the role of the outsider and pull the rest of the field — and the national conversation about public policy — even further to the left than he already has.

“I think his policies… are going to be the gold standard against which these other campaigns are going to be measured,” one former aide said, noting in particular Sanders’ work on economic and environmental issues. “He’s the only one generating real new ideas. To the extent that [the rest of the candidates] have new ideas, they’re all sort of watered down versions of his — not to put too fine a point on it.”",Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run changed politics.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have slowed down their offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw more than 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children, approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist redoubt.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped in less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, told AFP that thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali said.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes that Monday's arrivals would be the last one.

""We want it to be over,"" Mazloum, a 29 year-old SDF fighter told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Secret' transfers -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar told AFP on Monday that the SDF will announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

The Observatory on Monday said that 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq over the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied that the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

Fourteen suspected French jihadists were among those transferred, an Iraqi government source told AFP on Monday.

Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert with intimate knowledge of the issue, said the transfer had taken place in coordination with the US-led coalition fighting IS.

- Criticism of international response -

The mass outpouring of men, women and children from the IS foothold has overwhelmed the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp, six hours north of Baghouz.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" Omar said.

The International Rescue Committee said Friday that new arrivas had pushed the camp's population to over 45,000, exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, the IRC said.

A warehouse fire on Friday caused by a gas cylinder explosion ""destroyed 200 family tents"" and five larger ones and injured 16 workers, it said.

The UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA on Friday warned the camp was struggling to keep up with the flood of evacuees.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-144732631.html

House Democrats will vote next week on a resolution to block the national emergency declaration issued by Donald Trump in order to access billions of dollars Congress refused to give him to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

“The president’s act is lawless and does violence to our constitution and therefore to our democracy,” House speaker Nancy Pelosi said on a conference call, announcing that the chamber would vote on Tuesday. “Not only is he disrespecting the legislative branch and the constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office in which he serves.”

Though the effort is unlikely to succeed, it sets up a highly charged confrontation between the legislative and executive branches of government over the separation of powers outlined in the constitution. The move will also put pressure on Republicans who are uncomfortable about the precedent such a declaration might set – and the long-term consequences for Congress.

The one-page resolution was authored by Texas congressman Joaquín Castro, a Democrat and the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who called Trump’s action an “unconstitutional power grab”.

“This is an historic power grab,” Castro said. “It will require historic unity by members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative, to counteract the president’s parasitic movement.”

He added: “The president is declaring a national emergency to fulfill a campaign promise, not because there is an actual emergency on the United States border.”

The resolution, which states that Trump’s emergency declaration “is hereby terminated”, has at least 226 co-sponsors, Castro said. Despite an effort to attract bipartisan support, so far only one Republican has signed on: Justin Amash, a libertarian from Michigan. Democrats will work to add more ahead of the vote, which is expected on Tuesday.

Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico last week, after signing legislation to avert a second government shutdown which provided far less than he demanded to build his wall along the border.

In his run for the White House, the president promised to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it. Neither part of the promise has been fulfilled.

Congress has approved nearly $1.4bn to build 55 miles of new fencing and barriers along the border in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. Trump previously triggered a 35-day shutdown – the longest in history – after Congress rebuffed his demand for $5.7bn to begin construction on more than 200 miles of barriers.

The national emergency declaration allows the administration to transfer money from the defense department and other federal agencies. Trump has said that will give him access to an additional $6.6bn.

The action is being challenged in federal courts, including one case brought by a coalition of 16 states with Democratic attorneys general. Pelosi said the relevant House committees were studying alternative legal options but said Democrats’ focus at the moment was on passing the resolution.

With more than half of the members of the House signed on, the resolution will all but certainly pass. But the effort is likely to fall short in the Senate, where only a few Republicans have expressed interest, or to a Trump veto. It is unlikely either chamber could gather enough support to override a presidential veto.

Even so, the resolution is likely to put pressure on Republicans running for re-election next year in districts and states where Trump is unpopular.

Several Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that Trump’s action could set a precedent for a future Democratic president to declare a national emergency related to climate change or gun violence.

Susan Collins, a moderate Republican senator from Maine who is up for re-election in 2020, was the first in her party to publicly state support for a resolution blocking the emergency declaration.

With Republicans in the majority in the Senate, at least three more GOP senators would have to join her, if all of the Democrats voted for the resolution, for it to succeed.",Democrats file resolution to block Trump's 'unconstitutional power grab',Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-file-resolution-block-trump-170750684.html

They will also choose a future aligned with Europe or one aligned with Russia.","For many here, the EU represents a vision of how they wish their country would function: The bloc is seen as a largely transparent, rules-based society where leaders work for the people’s interests and where opportunities are available for those who put in the effort. The EU has steadily expanded eastward, and the possibility of joining can encourage significant reforms and better behavior from prospective member states.

But the failures of pro-European parties in power since 2009—not to mention the EU’s own struggles, from the aftermath of the eurozone debt crisis to the near exit of Greece from the bloc—have dulled that enthusiasm. Moldova currently ranks 117th in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, down from 89th in 2009, while support for continuing on the path toward the European Union dropped from 65 percent in 2010 to 40 percent in 2016, according to public-opinion polls conducted by the Institute for Public Policy, an independent research group based in Chisinau.

Despite Sandu’s conviction that Moldova should remain focused on attaining EU membership—admittedly an unlikely prospect anytime soon—surveys of Moldovan voters now put support for closer ties with the EU neck and neck with backing for Russia, if they had to choose just one (a significant number also say they don’t know which they prefer).

“I haven’t decided who I will vote for,” says Ilian, a detergent seller in Chisinau’s sprawling open-air market, where much of the population still comes to buy their groceries. The 33-year-old, who declined to give his last name, continued: “If there’s a space where you can say that you don’t support any candidate, I will tick that box.”

On the opposite end of the spectrum from Sandu sits Dodon, the former leader of the Socialist Party, who has been president since December 2016. Moldova’s presidency is meant to stand apart from party politics, and so Dodon is not officially campaigning in these elections, but his views are clear. While running for president, Dodon said that he would be ready to call a referendum on whether to extricate Moldova from its EU agreement, in favor of membership in the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. (His rhetoric since taking office has been more nuanced, but he was nevertheless temporarily suspended by Parliament in January 2018 for vetoing a bill aimed at stopping Russian news broadcasts in Moldova, one of several occasions that legislators have taken such action against him.)

Critics say Dodon has been pursuing a pro-Russian path, but he maintains that he is simply rebalancing the country’s alignment after a decade of what he described as anti-Russian rhetoric. “I think the greatest mistake is to make a choice,” he told me in an interview in his oversized office in the heart of Chisinau. “Moldovan society is split into two parts; one half wants to be friends with Russia, and the other half wants to be friends with Europe … We need good relations with Europe and all those agreements, and we need Russian sales markets for our goods. This is the only way out—any other option is internal destabilization and problems.”",A Global Geopolitical Crisis Comes to Moldova,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/02/moldova-elections-voters-europe-russia/583351/

Votes are being counted in Nigeria's closely-fought general election, with voting hours extended in some places following delays in the morning.

The main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari, 76, is the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, 72.

Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security threats, and a sluggish economy.

The election had been due to take place a week ago but was delayed at the last minute for logistical reasons.

President Buhari cast his ballot in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina. Asked if he would congratulate his rival if he lost, he said: ""I will congratulate myself.""

Reported attacks

About two hours before polls were due to open on Saturday, residents of the town of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state in the country's north-east reported hearing several blasts and gunfire.

State police said in a statement that there was no threat to public safety. ""The gunfire were not targeted at members of the public but was for security purposes,"" the statement said.

Borno is the birthplace of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which had said it planned to disrupt the elections.

In the north-eastern state of Yobe, suspected Islamist militants attacked the town of Geidam, forcing people to flee, the Reuters news agency reported.

Why was the election delayed?

The initial vote was rescheduled in a dramatic press conference in the early hours of Saturday 16 February, just five hours before polls were due to have opened.

Image copyright AFP Image caption President Muhammadu Buhari (l) is expected to face a strong challenge from Atiku Abubakar (r)

The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has given several reasons for the delay, including attempted sabotage and logistical issues such as bad weather and problems with delivering the ballot papers.

Inec has said that everything is in place for the poll to take place this time round.

How will the election work?

The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner in the first round, as long as that person gains at least 25% of the votes in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states.

There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by the two political giants and the established party machines behind them.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The ballot paper has to be extra long in order to fit on all 73 presidential candidates

The president's All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to take the country to the ""next level"", arguing that in his first four-year term Mr Buhari has done a lot of ""foundational work"" that may not be immediately obvious.

Mr Abubakar and his People's Democratic Party have pledged ""to get Nigeria working again"", saying that the president has wasted the last four years.

Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While they are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35.

What are the main issues?

Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development in the country.

It slipped into a recession in 2016 and a slow recovery has meant that not enough jobs have been created to cope with the large number of young people coming into the employment market. Currently nearly a quarter of the working age population is unemployed.

Mr Buhari has quelled a militant Islamist rebellion in the north-east of the country, but Boko Haram remains active. There has also been an upsurge in violence in the country's Middle Belt as traditional herders and more settled farmers have clashed.

Up until 1999 Nigeria was governed by either short-lived civilian administrations or military rulers. But this year marks 20 years since the return of democracy.

The DA faces a resurgent ruling African National Congress (ANC) under new President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has also vowed to root out graft and boost growth in Africa’s most industrialized economy..

The ANC has comfortably won every parliamentary election since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994 and the DA has made ruling South Africa a long-term ambition.

Still, corruption is perceived as a weakness for the ANC after years of rule by former President Jacob Zuma, who was removed from the presidency last year by the ANC after years of corruption probes. He denies any wrongdoing.

“The South Africa I want to build will have no place for corruption and corrupt politicians,” DA leader Mmusi Maimane told supporters at the party’s manifesto launch in Johannesburg.

He said his party would have “zero tolerance for corruption” and wanted to see corrupt politicians spend 15 years in jail.

The DA, which has roots among white liberals from the anti-apartheid era, elected its first black leader in 2015 to widen its appeal among voters, and improved its national credentials by winning control of three major cities in 2016.

Maimane also outlined manifesto pledges to create jobs by offering tax incentives to encourage new business and maximize the manufacturing, agriculture and tourism sectors to build the economy.

“If we can put a job in every home we can transform our society,” said Maimane

The first New Hampshire Democratic Primary Poll since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he’s running for president finds Sanders at a slight advantage with 27% of the vote, former Vice President Joe Biden with 25% and Sen. Kamala Harris at 12%. No other candidate clears double digits. The NH poll was conducted February 21-22 of registered voters, the Democratic primary ballot test had a sample of n=405, +/-4.8%.

Among voters ages 18-34, Bernie Sanders has a large lead with 44% of the vote. Joe Biden follows at 11%, Elizabeth Warren has 9%, and Kamala Harris is tied with Beto O’Rourke with 8% apiece.

Voters 35-54 years old prefer Biden (30%), then Sanders (26%). Harris takes 14%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar takes 10%, and Warren receives 7% of the vote.

Among voters aged 55-74 years, Joe Biden leads with 30%, followed by Sanders (18%) and Harris (13%), with Warren and Klobuchar tied in fourth with 8% apiece.

Among voters aged 75 and older, Biden leads with 39%, followed by Warren (18%), Klobuchar (11%), Sanders (10%) and Harris with 8%.

Republican Primary

While President Trump has a 52% disapproval and 43% approval in the Granite State, he has an 80% approval and 14% disapproval among GOP primary voters. This would help explain why in the ballot test between Trump and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, Trump has 82% of the vote and Weld has 18%. The Republican primary ballot test had a sample of n=328, +/-5.4%.

US Senate 2020

In a potential US Senate match up for 2020, current Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D) is tied with Governor Chris Sununu (R) at 44% each, with 12% of voters undecided. Shaheen leads among independents 44% to 39%. The NH poll had a sample of n=910, +/-3.2%.

2020 Ballot

President Trump trails in all his head-to-head matchups against potential Democratic nominees, his toughest opponents being Biden and Sanders, who both lead Trump 55% to 45%. When Trump is up against Warren he trails 52% to 48%, but when Howard Schultz is added to the ballot, Trump takes a 2-point lead (45% to 43%) with Schultz at 12%.

To a lesser extent, Schultz also tightens a race between Trump and Sanders from a 10-point lead to 6 points, 48% to 42%, with 10% voting for Schultz.

Ideal Candidate

Voters were also asked about which characteristics they seek in an ideal candidate. The most highly prioritized characteristic is truthfulness, as cited by 42% of respondents, followed by being on the same side of the issues at 25%. Experience (14%) and authenticity (13%) were the third and fourth most highly prioritized characteristics. The poll also finds the following preferences among voters regarding potential characteristics of a presidential candidate:

85% of voters agree that the president should make efforts to work with the other party, 6% disagree and 9% are unsure.

70% of voters agree that the president should be transparent about their financial background. 11% disagree, and 19% are unsure.

68% of voters want the president to be an aggressive leader. 10% disagree, and 22% are unsure.

50% of voters want a president that has held elected office before. 22% disagree, and 28% are unsure.

42% of voters don’t want candidates to talk about their religious beliefs, 20% do want them to talk about their religious beliefs and 38% are unsure.

38% think a woman should be either president or vice president, while 15% disagree, and 47% are unsure.

Military experience is a non-issue for a plurality (45%) of respondents. While 30% are not looking for military experience, 25% are.

Caller ID

The New Hampshire Emerson College poll was conducted February 21-22, 2019 under the Supervision of Professor Spencer Kimball. The sample consisted of registered voters, n=910, with a Credibility Interval (CI) similar to a poll’s margin of error (MOE) of +/- 3.2 percentage points. The data was weighted based on 2016 voter model, age, party affiliation,. It is important to remember that subsets based on gender, age, party breakdown, ethnicity and region carry with them higher margins of error, as the sample size is reduced.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

First of all, the institutional design of Indian democracy (parliamentary system, asymmetrical federalism, flexible Constitution amendment) is not “demos-constraining” in that it does not put significant obstacles to the democratic popular will. There are not too many veto points that might account for the failure of floor-securing social policies to be legislated and implemented.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

Second, the party system is intensely competitive with very high electoral volatility. The first-past-the-post system accentuates the effect of voters’ volatility into dramatic change in seats and government formation. Though the level of volatility has come down in this decade as compared to the previous one, a ruling party in an Indian state has just about a 50% chance of coming back to power. Parties cannot afford to be complacent and overlook issues that might concern a significant proportion of population.

Third, the state capacity in India is higher than most comparable poor countries; it still commands the force to impose its will and is not crippled by absence of resources to meet some of its key projects. All this makes it even more intriguing that the ruling parties/coalitions should not (be able to) muster adequate political will to carry out anti-poverty policies.

Finally, what makes it truly intriguing is that the poor have not opted out of democratic politics in India, at least not from routine participation in electoral politics.

…

Why elections have gained primacy in Indian democracy

Across countries in terms of the impact of the electoral system, the structure of political choices offered by the party system, the social basis of political preferences, agenda-setting and public opinion formation, the invisible role of issues and ideologies, interests and identities are seen to be the keys to making sense of elections.

Yet we simply assume that elections perform the same role everywhere. The end result of this similarity is that the experience of electoral politics in societies like India is interpreted in the light of the narrow historical experience of Western Europe and North America.

Hence the need to understand the distinctiveness of the Indian experience of elections.

One of the first things that strikes any observer of Indian elections is their centrality in India’s political life. Banners, posters, and crowds fill the streets; massive processions and rallies are a norm; the media is full of election news and every street corner is buzzing with political gossip. Though on a steady decline of late, this kind of visibility in Indian elections symbolises the pivotal role elections have come to play in Indian politics.

If tension between pre-existing social form and borrowed legal-political structure provides the basic frame for understanding Indian democracy, the history of Indian politics is an attempt by millions of ordinary people to write their own political agenda in an alien script.

An election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy.

An encounter such as this, if it is to lead to meaningful outcomes, requires bridges or hinges that connect the two different worlds.

The institution of elections came to perform this crucial role in India. It became the hinge that connected the existing social dynamics to the new political structures of liberal democracy, allowing for reciprocal influence. An election is often the site for a fusion of popular beliefs and political practices with high institutions of governance.

Thus an election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy. This is the moment when the legal-constitutional order of liberal democracy makes contact with the messy social and political reality of India. The “formal” sector is highly visible, it leads a legal-constitutional existence, it involves “civil society” groups and NGOs or a certain segment of political parties, it speaks a familiar modern language, mobilises secular identities and is easy to incorporate into a global register of democracy, even if it draws modest energy and participation.

Every political actor is aware of another “informal” sector, often seen as a source of embarrassment. Political organisations and movements that inhibit this sector speak a homespun hybrid language and fall back upon identity-based mobilisation. Though political practices in this sector lead an invisible, often paralegal, existence below the radar, this sector remains the most happening political site in terms of popular mobilisation and energy. The chasm that separates the two worlds and the absence or non-functioning of the other possible bridges has resulted in the unusual salience of the institution of elections.

This unique role is what accounts for the continued dynamism of the electoral process in India, while a number of other imported institutions and processes are floundering.

A festival of collective identity

Elections in India perform many more functions. For a postcolonial country like India, successful elections are still a symbol of a national political community, something of a festival of collective identity. For the poor and the marginalised, who are excluded from the normal functioning of the state, elections are an affirmation of their citizenship and are seen as a sacred ritual of political equality. Notwithstanding a robust media that routinely uses public opinion polls, elections are still the principal site for the dissemination of political ideas and information and also the only reliable method to gauge public opinion on the big issues facing the country.

Elections force political parties to consider ideas, interests, and entities that do not lend themselves to easy aggregation through instrumentalities of the “organised” sector. Thus, elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections are also an occasion for settling, unsettling or resettling local equations of social dominance and the arena of struggles for social identity and dignity. Elections are a site for contestation for social dominance in a locality, leading to assertion by dominant social groups and protests by subaltern groups.

Attempts by clever political entrepreneurs to manufacture a social majority often involve building a local coalition of castes and communities. This often leads to an invention of community boundaries and sometimes the jerrymandering of settled boundaries. In a micro as well as macro setting, elections are an occasion for distribution and redistribution of resources. This is the time for patronage distribution as well as the occasion for the ordinary citizens to collect their “dues” from the political class.

All this accounts for the festival-like character of the Indian elections and the fierceness with which they are contested here. At the same time, this compression of multiple decisions into a single act also results in an under-emphasis on the representational functions of elections.

Democrats’ embrace of sweeping progressive ideas like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal is about to get its first reality check on Capitol Hill — as both parties make huge bets about which message will sway voters in 2020.

For liberal Democrats, proposals to provide universal health care, combat climate change and create a fairer economy represent the kind of bold agenda they will need to unseat President Donald Trump, a candidate unafraid to make his own brash moves on trade and immigration. But Republicans are seizing on the same proposals to paint Democrats as socialist radicals, while trying to widen the ideological splits already emerging among Trump’s would-be challengers.

Story Continued Below

Senate Republicans plan to force a vote as early as next week, S.J. Res. 8, on progressives’ Green New Deal climate resolution, which has drawn support from almost all of the chamber’s declared and potential Democratic presidential hopefuls. House Democrats, meanwhile, are set to unveil legislation guaranteeing government-funded health care for all Americans — amid conflicting poll numbers about voters’ willingness to upend the existing health insurance market.

It’s the beginning of what promises to be a series of high-stakes tests that both parties insist will work to their advantage.

“The Republicans are misreading the moment,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), an outspoken liberal on issues like climate change. “We have never been more fired up.”

In fact, some progressives have invoked Trump’s upset 2016 win as an argument for taking a bold strategy into 2020 — evidence that Democrats should focus more on articulating popular core values and less on worrying about the practicalities. In the same way Trump fired up his base with pledges to build the wall and make America great again, progressives believe Democrats can piece together an even bigger coalition by branding themselves as the party of universal health care and economic equality.

“You could actually credit Donald Trump for this,” said Faiz Shakir, the new campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 run. “The kind of not giving a crap what others think, or what his critics think, and just plowing ahead with a vision has made progressives hungrier for a version of, well, what would that look like [on the left]?”

But top Republicans say they see Democrats veering off a socialist cliff — citing the Green New Deal, H. Res. 109 (116), and S. Res. 59, co-authored by New York freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a prime example.

“It’s entirely fantasy, it’s unrealistic. These are just talking points designed to appeal to the fringe of their party,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). He added, “It’s ended up causing quite a headache for our colleagues across the aisle who’ve tried to explain exactly what they’re trying to do and how they’re trying to do it.”

The debate in Congress’ opening months follows more than two years of arguments by progressive activists that Democrats need to be more than just the anti-Trump party to succeed in 2020. They say transformative policies are also increasingly necessary to counter major crises like a changing climate and the growing power of the super-rich.

“The center of energy in the Democratic Party is with these kinds of bold, progressive, populist ideas around transforming our economy and democracy,” said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, a group inspired by Sanders’ 2016 run and crucial to the rise of Ocasio-Cortez. “We’re making change happen pretty fast.”

Yet it’s also generated unease among party moderates. And while progressives point to strong polling in support of Medicare for All and aggressive climate action, the GOP is eager to spend the next several months chipping away at it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s call for a vote on the Green New Deal is aimed purely at driving a wedge through the Democratic Party, forcing liberal senators and vulnerable centrists alike to weigh in on a proposal that envisions remaking the U.S. economy in just a decade. Already, moderate Democratic senators like Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have groused publicly about the plan as moving too far, too fast.

Republicans in the House, meanwhile, are pressing for a series of hearings on Medicare for All, certain that enthusiasm for single-payer health care will plummet as voters study the details and trade-offs.

“Democrats’ Medicare for All proposal would force over 150 million Americans to lose their employer or their union-sponsored insurance,” said Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “You want to talk about sabotage? That’s what we should be having a hearing on.”

Democrats’ liberal wing vows to meet that challenge head on. And they’re expecting the party’s growing list of presidential candidates to stand with them through the long, bruising 2020 campaign.

Already, all six Democratic senators running for president have co-sponsored the Green New Deal, and five signed on last year to Medicare for All legislation. Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have sought to further separate themselves from the pack — Sanders is running as a democratic socialist in favor of free college and a break-up of the big banks, while Warren has rolled out plans for a wealth tax and universal child care.

In Congress, House progressives next week are rolling out a detailed road map to single-payer health care — even as party leaders urge a focus on the more immediate, incremental health issues that sparked their midterm electoral wave just months ago.

“What we’re proposing is really a transformation of the health care system to get out the pieces that are so embedded in it that it continues to make health care costs equivalent to 19 percent of GDP,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a Congressional Progressive Caucus leader who’s penning the Medicare for All bill. “The majority of the American public believes we should have what almost every other industrialized country in the world has.”

Still, Democrats acknowledge they’re inviting intense scrutiny of such transformative proposals — and the reckoning that’s in store if they miscalculate voter enthusiasm for policies that would upend broad swaths of the economy.

One presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), faced immediate blowback for suggesting at a CNN town hall in January that she would support eliminating private health insurance as part of a Medicare for All system. Similarly, the Green New Deal drew an early wave of confusion and gleeful GOP attacks after Ocasio-Cortez’s staff mistakenly distributed a document that included principles not endorsed by the resolution’s supporters — including phasing out nuclear energy and building high-speed rail “at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.”

And some moderate Democrats have privately pointed to House progressives’ difficulties securing 100 co-sponsors for their single-payer health care bill as evidence the party’s vocal left wing is overstating support for its policy ideas.

Some 2020 contenders are consciously tacking toward the center in the meantime. On Monday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar cast the Green New Deal as “aspirational” despite her endorsement of it, and Medicare for All as something to shoot for down the road — positioning herself instead as a more pragmatic candidate.

“It could be a possibility in the future,” Klobuchar said of single-payer health care. “But I’m looking for what’s working now.”

That’s a balancing act that several Democrats in Congress say they hope the party can strike — aligning with the progressive rhetoric that’s resonated with voters, while pursuing more incremental policies.

“It’s a great conversation starter,” Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, a freshman Democrat facing a tough reelection in 2020, said of the Green New Deal. “What’s proposed in there is a little too aggressive and a little too far right now, but we have got to have a conversation about climate change and what we’re doing to this planet.”

Democrats are similarly warning against litigating the details of moving to a single-payer health system, for fear of bogging down their advantage on health issues and giving Republicans new avenues of attack.

“What’s important is to get your values and your core principles out there,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Celinda Lake. “It’s classic for Democrats to jump right into the middle of the policy.”

Liberals, though, are chafing at the suggestion they limit their ambitions. They contend the GOP will try to paint all Democrats as left-wing firebrands anyway, so there’s little reason not to lean into big solutions that the public finds popular.

“This is actually politicians catching up to the people and the economic realities that they live in,” said former Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat who lost his seat in 2010 after backing Obamacare and a cap-and-trade proposal on climate change. “Taking a good idea and cutting it in half used to make it more popular. Now it sounds tone deaf.”

Indeed, the super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership is already targeting moderate freshmen Antonio Delgado of New York and Colin Allred of Texas over the Green New Deal — even though neither signed onto the resolution.

Those are divisions Republicans aim to exploit in the coming weeks on climate and health care, marking the first in what’s likely to be a string of tough tests for 2020 Democrats grappling with the left’s newfound power and heightened expectations.

This is a week replete with challenges for President Donald Trump.

He faces a second summit with North Korea’s leader, a Democratic challenge to his emergency border declaration and public testimony from a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian election meddling, which could be nearing completion.

Mueller: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who has said the president directed him to make illegal hush money payments, is set to testify on what he knows about the 2016 campaign. Border: House Democrats have set a vote for tomorrow on a resolution to block Trump’s emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern U.S. Border with Mexico. The measure will force Republicans to take a stand on whether the president exceeded his authority over federal spending. Summit: The president said yesterday he doesn’t expect to lift sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime, as he prepares for a summit with the North Korean leader this week on U.S. demands that Pyongyang end its nuclear program.

Another pressing issue has already been punted. Trump said late yesterday that he’ll extend Friday’s deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in the latest round of trade talks in Washington.

Global Headlines

Venezuela standoff | U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet opposition leader Juan Guaido in Bogota today and plans to announce new actions against Venezuela that may include forms of economic or diplomatic pressure, according to an administration official. Guaido’s efforts to deliver aid convoys to Venezuela from Colombia this weekend were violently quashed by forces loyal to Nicolas Maduro, but nothing has really changed on the ground. The nation is still hungry, scared and wondering what comes next.

Raising the stakes | Theresa May again put off a final parliamentary ballot on her Brexit agreement, this time until March 12, as she seeks concessions from the European Union. But the delay risks further angering ministers who fear the premier’s strategy is pushing the country to the brink of a catastrophic no-deal departure. They’ll have a chance to force her hand on Wednesday, when lawmakers are due to vote on an amendment to delay Brexit to avoid the economic damage of crashing out.

War and peace | Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War during their summit this week in Vietnam, South Korea said. While the move may help fulfill the U.S. leader's pledge to cease “endless wars,” it also risks undercutting arguments for maintaining the American troop presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Taking a hit | Italian Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement suffered another blow in a regional vote, this time on the island of Sardinia, where exit polls showed the party’s support tumbled. That's bad news for the stability of the alliance with the League because of growing pressure on Di Maio to increase his influence and prove Five Star is getting something out of the governing coalition.

New direction | China’s Politburo laid out a broad outline on how the nation’s more than $40 trillion finance sector should transform itself through supply-side reform – and by further opening up the industry. The government's push to control risk appears to be giving way to a desire to support its economy, as signaled by comments President Xi Jinping made at the gathering of China’s 25 most senior leaders.

What to Watch Today

Nigeria’s electoral commission plans to start announcing state-by-state results from the tight presidential race between the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar.

And finally ... Algerians have been protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term in elections in April. In response to the peaceful rallies – which started Friday and are the biggest in the North African oil producer in years – the new head of the ruling FLN party, Mourad Bouchared, said God had sent the president, now in his 80s and ailing, to look after the country and reform it. Social media pundits saw the humor and the TweetCommeMouad hashtag appeared.

But Howie Hawkins wants to set th…","The question is whether the public will listen. Once widely accused of spoiling a presidential election that led to two wars, the Green Party has been mostly relegated to a political punchline, thanks in part to the foibles of its former leader Jill Stein. Now, the Green New Deal—which helped to differentiate the eco-socialists Greens from the Democrats—has been coopted. The Democrats are even warming to socialist ideas. So does America even need a Green Party anymore? Or does America need it now more than ever?



The Green Party barely registered notice in 1996 when it fielded its first presidential candidate, who only made it onto the ballot in 22 states. But four years later, nominee Ralph Nader qualified in 43 states and won about 2.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Because he drew 95,000 votes in Florida, the famously decisive state in that election, he was accused of handing the presidency to George W. Bush. Nader and his supporters—among others—reject the argument that he spoiled the election, but there’s no denying that the 2000 election established the Greens’ legitimacy and influence as a third party.

Nearly two decades later, the Green Party has lost some of both—though it might still have enough support to tip the results of a presidential election. The party’s two-time nominee, Jill Stein, received just .4 percent of the vote in 2012, but 1.1 percent in 2016. The latter was “enough votes to tip the scales for Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” claimed Vanity Fair. (More accurately, her vote total in the three key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania was higher than Trump’s margin of victory, but there’s no evidence that Stein’s supporters would have voted for Clinton otherwise. They may have chosen no one at all.) Stein also potentially compromised her party’s legitimacy with her connection to multiple scandals related to the Russia investigation—not to mention her curious comments on vaccines and the health affects of Wi-Fi.

Stein has suggested she won’t seek the party’s nomination in 2020, so there’s potential for a new Green voice. But it’s not yet clear who that will be. Aside from Hawkins and Schlakman, only 12 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Green Party nomination. It’s hard to tell which are serious. Kanye Deez Nutz West most likely is not. But Dario Hunter is, and he’s about as diverse as candidates come: black, gay, Iranian, and Jewish. He’s also an ordained rabbi, a former environmental attorney, and a school board member in Youngstown, Ohio. These qualities all make him an ideal new voice for the party, he said. “If we want to cut through the lack of attention given [to Greens], we need someone who has a loud and clear voice and a tough skin,” he said. “It takes a tough skin to be an openly gay black son-of-an immigrant Jewish rabbi.”

Why should there be attention given to Greens, though, now that Democrats have embraced the Green New Deal? Simple, said Hunter: “This Democratic version of the Green New Deal is watered down. It pales in comparison to ours.”",Will the Democrats Kill the Green Party by Stealing Its Best Idea?,Newrepublic.com,https://newrepublic.com/article/153127/will-democrats-kill-green-party-stealing-best-idea

The current government wants closer EU integration and warns of catastrophe if the country falls back into Russia’s sphere of influence.

But corruption scandals and worries over the health of its democracy have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The opposition Socialist Party, which favors closer ties to Moscow, took a slight early lead at 29.5 percent, with 30 percent of votes counted. The ruling pro-Western Democratic Party trailed with 28.8 percent, while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight entrenched corruption, was third with 22 percent.

A clearer picture of the final tally will emerge on Monday.

An inconclusive election or one marred by allegations of fraud could tip the country back into instability just as it has recovered from a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

If the results are split, it could set the stage for weeks of coalition talks or another election.

“If no one has a parliamentary majority, I think that there will be attempts to form it, but the risk is high that it could come to a snap election in the coming few months,” President Igor Dodon told reporters.

On Saturday, Dodon, the former Socialist Party chief, called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”. He and leading opposition figures have threatened to launch street protests and raised concerns about vote-buying.

“If the elections are rigged even more than they have already been rigged to this day, we will come out to protect our vote,” ACUM leader Maia Sandu said.

POISONED POLITICS

The campaign has already been dogged by controversy.

In the past few days alone, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia’s interior ministry announced an investigation into Democratic Party leader Vladimir Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organized crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favor by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

Previously, Moldovans voted on party lists, but the Democratic Party introduced a mixed system of party lists and first-past-the-post constituency races, against the advice of European rights experts. The Democratic Party rejects suggestions it benefits most from the new voting system.

It has in turn accused Dodon of colluding with Russia to put the Socialists in power, which the president denies.

“Moldova has the potential for development, it’s only necessary that the authorities not be corrupt, that they should think about the people, and not only about their own pockets,” said Alexandra Ciorescu, a 72-year-old pensioner.

BELIEVING IN THE FUTURE

The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014 but has become increasingly critical of Chisinau’s track record on reforms.

One of Europe’s poorest countries, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, Moldova plunged into crisis in 2014 and 2015 after $1 billion was pilfered from three banks.

The EU froze aid after a court struck down the victory in the Chisinau mayoral race of one of ACUM’s leaders, Andrei Nastase, on a technicality last year. The European Parliament declared it “a state captured by oligarchic interests”.

Plahotniuc’s party has trumpeted the achievements of its government under Prime Minister Pavel Filip. The economy is growing, the banking system has stabilized and cooperation with the International Monetary Fund resumed.

“I believe in the future of Moldova,” Filip said after casting his vote. “We are ready to continue reforms and all social programs, the implementation of which will change the lives of Moldovan citizens for the better.”

Dodon and the Democratic Party have clashed over issues ranging from relations with Russia to ministerial appointments.

WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Liberal Democratic presidential contenders' rush to embrace the left's most ambitious proposals has some Democrats worried there could be a price to pay when they try to defeat President Donald Trump next year.

Party activists have been energized as Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and other candidates endorsed plans to provide Medicare coverage to every American, some form of tuition-free college, a national $15 minimum wage and the so-called ""Green New Deal"" advocated by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

But Trump and his allies in the Republican Party have seized on those stances to attack the Democratic 2020 field as outside the American political mainstream — a claim the president plans to make throughout his re-election campaign, according to sources with knowledge of his strategy.

Some Democrats fear the argument has potency. They worry the primary may produce a nominee who will not appeal to centrist working and middle-class voters who voted for Trump in 2016 but whom Democrats believe they can win back.

""The big progressive programs are popular in a caucus or primary electorate, but probably don't move the needle among voters who want to find someone who will change Washington by tilting the system to favor people in the middle — not the very rich or the very poor,"" said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democrat who worked for former President Barack Obama's campaign.

A person familiar with the president's thinking told Reuters that Trump had been looking for a ""big contrast issue"" to help power his 2020 bid.

His last Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was widely known to the voting public before her campaign. This time, Trump may face someone new to the national stage, and he is looking to brand that candidate before she or he emerges as the nominee.

In recent speeches, including his State of the Union address and again this week in Florida, a key 2020 battleground, Trump used the crisis in Venezuela to equate Democrats with socialists.

""There's no question this is a deliberate strategy on his part,"" said Matt Bennett, a political analyst with Third Way, a Democratic centrist think-tank. ""It is a bit scary to think about what it could do to us in a close, tough election next year.""

GOING GREEN

Democrats have already seen the risks of catering to progressives.

Senators Booker of New Jersey, Harris of California, Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts almost immediately backed Ocasio-Cortez's push earlier this month for the Green New Deal, a sweeping 10-year blueprint for combating climate change that involves reducing carbon emissions and retrofitting infrastructure.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist who announced this week he is running for president a second time, plans to introduce his own version of the climate plan.

Ocasio-Cortez, who has enjoyed disproportionate influence for a first-term congresswoman because of her social media presence, was forced to backtrack when an information sheet contained policy goals not in the plan, including doing away with nuclear power and airplanes and providing income to Americans ""unwilling to work.""

That didn't stop Trump and other Republicans from treating those goals as fact, suggesting that Democrats want to destroy air travel and expand the welfare rolls.

Republicans also jumped on Ocasio-Cortez's proposal to hike the marginal tax rate to 70 percent as a way to finance her environmental initiative. Even so, Warren followed by suggesting a ""wealth tax"" on Americans with large fortunes to help finance her child-care plan.

Democrats are ""afraid to tell their base what is practical"" and instead are offering policies that have little chance of being enacted, said Bryan Lanza, a former campaign aide to Trump who regularly defends the president on cable news.

Recent Democratic presidential nominees such as Clinton, Obama and John Kerry ran as centrists. This is the first election in the modern era, Lanza said, in which progressives ""are sucking up all the oxygen and energy.""

Democrats as a whole, however, have been moving in a more leftward direction for years. According to Gallup polling, the number of Democrats who identify themselves as ""liberal"" has risen from 32 percent in 2001 to 46 percent as of 2018.

That shift has largely been among white, highly educated Democrats. African-American and Hispanic voters remain more moderate — which could present a challenge as the party tries to mobilize those groups to vote in greater numbers.

So far, the moderate wing of the party is under-represented in the 2020 field. Some Democratic strategists are concerned the party did not heed the lesson from last year's congressional elections, when it took power in the U.S. House of Representatives largely through moderate candidates who won over suburban voters by focusing on ""kitchen-table"" issues such as coverage for preexisting medical conditions.

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is one of the few Democrats in the presidential field to push back at the progressive agenda. At a CNN town hall this week, she called the Green New Deal ""aspirational"" and suggested Medicare for all was only a potential long-term goal.

John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman and a centrist who has gotten little traction as a presidential contender, this week said the 2020 primary ""is going to be a choice between socialism and a more just form of capitalism.""

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in the early primary state of South Carolina, said candidates must soon balance sweeping agendas with more pragmatic proposals.

""It has to be a mixed bag of what makes sense and will not cause us long-term political damage,' he said. (Reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Cynthia Osterman)

Stephen Biegun, named Donald Trump’s special envoy for North Korea six months ago, flew to Hanoi ahead of the Feb. 27-28 meeting in the Vietnamese capital where Trump hopes to get closer to his goal of persuading Pyongyang to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States.

In meetings with his North Korean counterpart, Biegun, a 55-year-old former Ford Motor Co executive, aims to hammer out a joint summit statement showing concrete progress beyond vague commitments agreed by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at their first meeting in June.

It’s a tall order, even for someone accustomed to tough assignments.

Before joining Ford as head of international government relations, Biegun was handed the job of giving Sarah Palin a crash course in foreign policy when she was John McCain’s 2008 presidential running mate.

Such experience could prove helpful in explaining what is achievable to Trump, who came into office similarly lacking in diplomatic experience and has set his sights on North Korea as one issue he can tout as a major success that has eluded his predecessors.

While Biegun worked for decades as congressional staffer and as a White House foreign policy aide under President George W. Bush, his latest appointment was initially greeted with skepticism, given he was primarily a Russia specialist with little exposure to the complex North Korea problem.

But several North Korea experts who have since advised Biegun told Reuters they have been struck by how methodical he was in taking the time to talk to as many of them as possible and described him as a quick learner.

Nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico who is among those who has met Biegun, said was encouraged by the way Biegun had made up for his lack of specialist knowledge by seeking out the right people.

“What he’s been doing is learning and gathering things. I’m impressed by what he’s done - he’s got good advisers.”

A 16-member team Biegun took with him to Pyongyang for three days of talks earlier this month included missile experts, nuclear experts and specialists in international law.

A Capitol Hill staffer whose Democratic Party has been critical of Trump’s personal approach to North Korea, said Biegun’s attitude appeared “much more realistic than what we’ve heard from the administration thus far.”

“He really stands head and shoulders above the rest ... and comes to this a with a relatively fresh set of eyes, and as someone who isn’t making old assumptions but also who isn’t making the wrong assumptions.”

Biegun has also won admirers in South Korea, where one former senior diplomat said he clearly had experience in handling complex issues and knew how Washington works. “Among all the nuclear envoys I’ve seen for decades, he must be the weightiest,” he said.

However, it will take more than intelligence, gravitas, an open mind and political savvy to convince North Korea to abandon a nuclear weapons program its ruling family has long seen as essential to its survival.

Biegun has avoided formal media interviews, but did deliver a wide-ranging speech at Stanford University on Jan. 31, when he admitted that despite months of U.S.-North Korea talks, the two sides still had no agreed definition of the term “denuclearization.”

And in spite of Trump’s declaration after the last summit that the nuclear threat from North Korea was over, the country has yet to agree to freeze production of fissile material and its missile program, despite a de facto moratorium on nuclear and missile testing since 2017.

Biegun has said he will be seeking both in Hanoi and will also be looking to agree a roadmap for a possibly lengthy post-summit negotiation process.

INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, MILITARY DOUBTS

Yet neither the U.S. intelligence community, nor regional military commanders believe North Korea will agree to give up all of its nuclear weapons.

While welcoming an easing of tensions, critics worry the Trump administration - Biegun included - is now following Pyongyang’s playbook by dropping past demands for complete denuclearization before any concessions.

Trump and U.S. officials insist North Korea’s complete and verified denuclearization remains the ultimate goal, but experts say the mechanics of a negotiated process mean this could take many years - if it happens at all.

Trump’s close involvement could prove a mixed blessing for Biegun.

Unlike predecessors, Biegun has had significant direct contact with Trump, including involvement in White House talks with North Korean officials and an Oval Office meeting with the president in December.

But Trump has sometimes demonstrated a tendency to ignore advisers and act on impulse.

Biegun, according to a veteran American North Korea hand,” is a prisoner ... of a president who has no interest in the substance of the issues.” “The president’s priority is himself - his brand,” the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Biegun is also beholden to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a trusted Trump aide with a reputation for following the president’s marching orders and for rarely contradicting him.

While Pompeo has overall control of North Korea policy, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, known for hawkish views on a range of global issues, has appeared to fade into the background on North Korea since his calls for the nation’s rapid disarmament nearly derailed the first summit.

The extent of Bolton’s involvement in the Hanoi meeting remains unclear.

Analysts say that for Biegun’s methodical approach to prevail he will need to deliver a semblance of progress in Hanoi. They warn Trump’s taste for a showy moment and apparent lack of patience with the sort of detailed drawn-out haggling any lasting deal will require could complicate Biegun’s task.

Toby Dalton, of the Nuclear Policy Program at Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who was among Biegun’s advisers, noted he had left himself ample leeway in his Stanford speech for a reason.

“This reflects uncertainly about what U.S. policy is,” he said. “U.S. policy is what the president says it is on any given day.”",Trump's North Korea envoy Biegun: a capable man in an impossible job?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-biegun-idUSKCN1QC0GH
191,Empty,2019-02-22T20:15:37Z,Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker is traipsing into a very different fundraising environment when he touches down in Silicon Valley this weekend for three events.,"He is the intermittent faster, the Tim Ferriss podcaster, the first-generation tweeter, the startup founder, the college pal of Reid Hoffman and other Stanford graduates of the early ’90s who built the modern Internet.

If any Democratic presidential candidate has tapped into the Silicon Valley zeitgeist over their careers, it is Cory Booker. And in 2019, that could be as much a political liability as it is a financial asset.

Booker, long the darling of the tech industry and some of its marquee leaders, is traipsing into a transformed Silicon Valley when he touches down in town this weekend for his first fundraising trip here since he announced he was running for president. Friday lunch guests at the San Francisco home of David Shuh, Friday dinner guests at the 9,300-square-foot Piedmont home of Ali Partovi, and Saturday evening guests at the Atherton home of Gary Lauder (an heir to the Estée Lauder beauty empire) are paying up to $2,800 each to rub shoulders with Cory Booker.

Then again, most have probably met him before. The presidential candidate has collected half a million dollars from the internet industry over his five years in the Senate, from people like LinkedIn’s Hoffman, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs, and early Facebook exec Sean Parker.

Why? He is culturally of this place, donors say.

But times have changed, and Silicon Valley is no longer merely an ATM for Cory Booker.

Twitter is no longer primarily a place to find an elderly man snowtrapped in his home in Newark, like Booker once did — it is now also a cesspool of hate and misinformation. Mark Zuckerberg is no longer a hero brandishing a $100 million check in a well-meaning attempt to save Newark’s schools, like Booker once described him — he is a bogeyman who badly mishandled our last election and is now as divisive as any of the people running for president.

Silicon Valley is itself a minefield that in some ways sums up the broader political challenge for Booker in 2020: He’s running as a liberal on issues including tech regulation, but the progressive left holds him in suspicion — and he could face more as he begins to court tech money more openly.

Booker’s tightrope walk needs to capitalize on his decades of coziness with tech elites and corporate America while not offending the liberal base that has them in its crosshairs.

“Cory Booker is the Manchurian candidate of Silicon Valley. I believe they have cultivated him and groomed him,” said Jamarlin Martin, a 41-year-old political activist who runs a collection of digital media sites serving black audiences. “He’s going to run into problems as the public becomes more aware that he’s in bed with our generation’s Big Tobacco.”

Cory Booker’s super PAC bind

Democrats have dramatically soured on Silicon Valley over the last year: They’re now about evenly split on whether social media companies are good for democracy, for instance. That’s a far cry from a decade ago, when Silicon Valley epitomized the modern, progressive, cool mores of Barack Obama’s Democratic Party.

Cory Booker thought it did, too. Now, he appears less sure.

“The problem we have right now in America,” he told Recode in 2017, “is it is a perversion of the free market where corporate villainy is reigning.”

To understand Booker’s love/hate relationship with Silicon Valley, look no further than how he’s handling the Bay Area’s most prominent outside group so far this primary: the super PAC set up by his Stanford classmate, Steve Phillips.

Phillips and I are sitting in a corner of The Battery, the posh hangout for the tech elite in San Francisco. Phillips isn’t in tech — he’s a lawyer by trade, and a political operative by practice — but he is a key Booker emissary to the world of tech’s mega wealthy.

He’s introduced Booker to the likes of billionaire Salesforce chief Democratic donor Marc Benioff (at Obama’s second inauguration) and to Google super-executive David Drummond. And while Phillips has his detractors in the Democratic fundraising world who think him more flash than substance, according to some Democratic sources, he’s got the ability to raise big money thanks to his marriage into the family of Herb Sandler, one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors in recent cycles. He’s prioritized mobilization above persuasion, working on behalf of candidates of color like Obama, Stacey Abrams, and even Kamala Harris.

His new group, Dream United, is the only candidate-specific super PAC up and running so far in the 2020 primary. Phillips claims $4 million in commitments to back Booker.

“[Booker] was seen as the senator of Silicon Valley”

“He was seen as the senator of Silicon Valley,” Phillips argued. “There’s this cultural connection that’s a little bit deeper with him.”

But here’s the thing: Just like Booker isn’t totally sure how he feels about Silicon Valley big money, one gets the sense that Booker isn’t totally sure how he feels about his old friend Steve Phillips, either.

Booker has ruled out taking money from corporate PACs, but he’s been hard to pin down on what he thinks should be done with Phillips’s group.

Booker has predictably been asked about how he feels about an outside group that can take millions from billionaires — and his protestations have not been effusive. His campaign has said he opposes super PACs “aiming to support his or anyone’s candidacy for president.”

But when asked last week specifically whether Phillips’s group should be shut down, he would only tell reporters, “I urge anyone and everyone not to have super PACs in this race.” Of course, candidates can’t coordinate with super PACs, so Booker can’t issue instructions to them on how to spend the money — but he’s not exactly washing his hands of them, either.

One tech donor close with the New Jersey senator told me that the word he has gotten from inside the Booker operation is to not cooperate with Dream United. But it’s a hazy instruction, and maybe intentionally so: Booker’s looking for rhetorical cover in a political climate in which super PACs have transformed from a financial necessity into a public-relations vulnerability; Phillips has enough rhetorical cover, too, to claim he hasn’t been totally disavowed.

Phillips said the criticisms of his group are merely “political gamesmanship” and that other Democratic contenders are eagerly accepting max-out $2,800 checks — and “not from waitresses or bus drivers,” as Phillips put it. But Phillips said he doesn’t need Booker’s permission to do the organizing work he has long done in the black community, and that he’s not shutting anything down just because of the moment’s politics.

“The perception of what a super PAC is is a convenient bogeyman. I get that,” he said as he held court in The Battery, where it was hard not to notice that he was one of the only African Americans in the room. “But if there’s a rich person who wants to support black-voter mobilization in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, why would I turn that down?”

Another possible super PAC donor, Los Angeles billionaire surgeon Gary Michelson, who got close with Booker, a fellow vegan, after the senator headlined an animal-welfare banquet in Los Angeles in late 2016, said he was eager for the campaign to clarify its position on the super PAC. Despite Phillips’s claim that Michelson is a financial supporter of Dream United, Michelson told Recode he was willing to donate up to $1 million to the super PAC but had said he wouldn’t make any commitments until he got more information.

“You’re reading the same signals I’m reading. It’s going to have to be better than that,” said Michelson. “I’d have to make sure that this would not go against Cory’s interests or his wishes. I don’t want to hurt someone by helping him.”

Booker’s love affair with Silicon Valley

That, in many ways, sums up Booker’s bind: How can he tap Silicon Valley’s largesse without being caricatured as the candidate of the neoliberal rich?

“The internet happened — and it happened where he went to college at the time he went to college”

Take a look at Booker on policy that matters to tech: He was once a champion of education reform, the cause célèbre of tech donors, but has grown quieter on that issue over time. He has targeted wealthier families with higher taxes as part of a plan to give poor kids money and attack the racial wealth gap, but it’s not as extreme as the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing of his party.

And while tech policy drives relatively few tech donors, he has similarly tried to walk a fine line.

On the one hand, in a race where presidential candidates are harshly calling out the perils of big tech in their announcement speeches, some tech donors take comfort in the idea that Booker is fundamentally optimistic about their industry. The next president will have wide latitude about how much they actually want to take Silicon Valley to task.

“There are lots of politicians on both sides of the aisle that seem to welcome throwing punches at employers,” Carl Guardino, who has hosted fundraisers for Booker and is the head of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, told Recode. “Cory Booker will never do that.”

But on the other, the politics of tech have changed drastically since Booker first joined Twitter a decade ago, and Booker has spent the last few years grappling with things he might have missed.

Booker has taken a more aggressive stance toward big tech than the unbridled reverence he expressed for it in his early years. On an episode of Recode Decode in 2017, he cast a glaring eye on Amazon, Google, and Facebook — companies that he has long wooed and, if things had played out differently, that he might’ve worked at.

Booker advocates in the Valley are hopeful that his new punchiness toward big tech will insulate him from critiques on the left that he is too close with the players here.

Look at Matt Stoller, a leading Washington voice against the monopoly power of companies like Facebook and Google. You’d expect him to rake Booker over the coals for being in bed with big tech. I did when I called him.

But nope.

“It’s reasonable to consider his relationships with people in Silicon Valley,” Stoller told me. “But he spoke out in 2017 when very few people did.”

Those relationships, though, run deep. In the eyes of many donors here, he is, in their words, “one of us.”

A Stanford man at the dawn of the internet

Booker’s love affair with Silicon Valley began three decades ago when he arrived as a freshman at Stanford. A year behind Hoffman and a year ahead of Peter Thiel, the backup tight end Cory Booker got a little lucky.

“The internet happened — and it happened where he went to college at the time he went to college,” said Gina Binachini, a college friend of Booker’s who is a longtime entrepreneur in the Valley.

Those Stanford connections paid off with introductions. Booker, bursting with potential and ambition, got to know venture capitalists like Lauder, Ron Conway, and Ted Schlein as he was building a national profile in Newark.

Schlein, who met Booker before he became mayor, told me that he’s introduced him to some CEOs out here and has held sessions for him to learn about different parts of tech. Schlein later hosted a fundraising event for Booker at the Rosewood, Silicon Valley’s see-and-be-seen hotel on Sand HIll Road.

And for a young, camera-loving, media-savvy politician, technologies like Twitter were catnip. In 2009, Binachini recalls Booker spending a day at LinkedIn under Hoffman’s tutelage, meeting executives from places like Apple and Facebook, drinking it all in. Now, when every Democratic politician has highly paid digital strategists who can turn Luddites into Snapchat sensations, it’s easy to forget how agile Booker was on these platforms when they were still young.

He was genuinely impressed with these people.

From green tech to social media: inspiring meetings today. Incredible Silicon Valley leaders who are literally changing/empowering the world — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) May 29, 2009

His tightness with the Valley has already given him one buzz-saw experience: Booker was actually a startup co-founder, at a video company called Waywire, and his role at the startup blew up into a controversy during his 2013 Senate race when opponents labeled it a conflict of interest. (Booker eventually donated his shares.) That experience drew him closer to the Valley, though, helping him appreciate just how hard it is to build a successful company, one person who worked with him at the time said.

But Booker’s posture toward Silicon Valley in those early years looks almost naive in the rearview mirror.

Take the now-famous story of how Booker convinced Mark Zuckerberg to invest $100 million into Newark schools in 2010. It was brokered through a venture capitalist, Marc Bodnick, the brother-in-law of Sheryl Sandberg, at the elite media-deals conference in Sun Valley, the so-called “summer camp for billionaires.” The Newark mayor and the Facebook chief found common ground on a walk that Idaho summer. Zuckerberg at that point had never been to Newark. The infusion of cash was announced with glitz and glam on the set of another billionaire, Oprah.

At best, the project had mixed results. Booker’s bet that a tech billionaire could throw enough money at a problem and fix it sounds very quaint in 2019.

Still, all those those controversies, startup travails, Sun Valley visits, and reunions at his alma mater have given Booker a range of possible donors that are the envy of the Democratic field.

But the general sense gleaned from interviews with top Democratic givers and fundraisers in Silicon Valley is that the emphasis right now — above all else — is on a candidate who can win. Booker’s politics are more mainstream than the Elizabeth Warrens of the world, And tech donors, predictably, are technocratic, data-driven, and less convinced that the class warfare waged by the furthest-left candidates is a winning strategy.

“That is the single No. 1 important criterion. Consider the alternative,” said Lauder, Booker’s host this weekend. “If I didn’t think that Cory had a chance, I wouldn’t be doing this.”

It’s important not to overstate Booker’s immediate financial support. I reached out to about two dozen top Democratic donors and fundraisers in the Valley, including some who had backed Booker in previous races, and asked if they planned to endorse him this cycle. It’s hard to find committed donors right now.

Former eBay CEO John Donahoe, a top giver in recent cycles? He’s met with Booker and says he’s “impressed.” But an endorsement? “It’s way too early.”

Kleiner Perkins kingmaker John Doerr told me through a spokesperson, “It’s too early in the process for him to have a sense of who he will support.”

Even Schlein, Doerr’s partner at Kleiner Perkins who has known Booker since before he was mayor, said it’s “very early to endorse anyone yet.”

Silicon Valley’s big donors are torn. But do they even matter anymore?

It’s not a Booker-specific problem. Democratic donors across the country are generally pushing the brakes on early exclusive endorsements of candidates this cycle, in a jump-ball field and with the decisions of several donor-friendly candidates — like Beto O’Rourke, Joe Biden, and even Mike Bloomberg — still to be determined.

Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz — the new hot money in Silicon Valley Democratic politics — is not expected to make any early endorsements in the primary. Hoffman, despite his decades-long relationship with Booker dating back to Stanford, is expected to write $2,800 checks to as many as six Democratic primary candidates but is not going to be using his billions to sway the process, according to a person close to him. That might surprise some Booker supporters who were hoping for Hoffman to advocate for him more publicly.

It is Kamala Harris, leading Democratic fundraisers in the Valley say, who represents the clearest challenge to Booker in the money world here. Her ties to Silicon Valley are less cultural than Booker’s and more rooted in organizational power as an incumbent senator and, before that, a Bay Area politician.

One early get was Susie Tompkins Buell, a close associate of Hillary Clinton and one of her top bundlers, who surprised the Silicon Valley set with her early Harris endorsement this month. Harris is also close with Benioff, who has known her for 30 years, but he’s likely to back several candidates this cycle.

“Kamala is one of the highest-integrity people I’ve ever met and is a phenomenal prosecutor,” Benioff told me. “She is truly an impressive leader with a strong legal and public service background.”

Marc Benioff: “Kamala is one of the highest-integrity people I’ve ever met”

Another person making their preferences public: Ron Conway, a venture capitalist and an influential Democratic powerbroker, listed Harris and Booker as the two candidates he’s backing this cycle.

Booker and Harris “have the greatest understanding of Silicon Valley and have cultivated the deepest relationships,” Conway told me. “Though they won’t always agree with the tech sector’s perspective, they’re generally both allies and each ‘gets it.’”

But times have changed in an era in which Bernie Sanders can raise $6 million within 24 hours of his launch from small donors (more than Phillips has claimed, for instance). How deep the Moskovitzes and Hoffmans and Benioffs and Conways will give during the general election will matter to the nominee. But there is an ascendant belief in the world of Democratic money that the personal preferences of the bagmen matters less than it once did, especially in primaries.

While the well-networked bundler who can collect more max-out contributions will still be in demand, there are not many outside groups for Silicon Valley’s billionaires to back if they’re hoping to give beyond the $2,800 maximum campaigns can accept.

What Sanders showed two elections ago, and O’Rourke one election ago, is that Democrats can be competitive with big-money machines merely with good old-fashioned viral marketing.

“We used to have this invisible primary where reporters would closely follow fundraising numbers,” said Shomik Dutta, an Obama fundraiser who recently joined Harris’s national finance committee. “The first litmus test of strength is now content.”

NBC News Sanders, Harris weigh in on Venezuela, call for restraint from Maduro POLITICO Are …","New Hampshire is still feeling the Bern.

Three years after he handily won the first-in-the-nation primary against Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads the Democratic primary field in a newly released survey.

Sanders, who announced his second bid for the presidency last week, received 27 percent of the vote in a survey from Emerson College. The self-identified democratic socialist beat out the reigning 2020 polling champion, former Vice President Joe Biden, by 2 percentage points. Biden is still undecided on a run.

The next three candidates weren't even close: California Sen. Kamala Harris at 12 percent; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 9 percent; and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 8 percent.

The polling breakdown from Emerson also shows Sanders is a stronger liberal candidate than Warren in a general election match up against President Trump.

Although both Sanders and Warren beat Trump in a head-to-head contest, throw in former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent campaign, and only Sanders emerged victorious. He beat Trump 48 percent to 42 percent in that scenario, with Schultz taking 10 percent. Warren dropped below Trump -- 44 percent to Trump's 45 percent -- but was within the margin of error.

The poll also found Trump would trounce former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld by 66 percentage points in a GOP primary contest, fueled by an 80 percent approval rating among Republican voters in New Hampshire. Weld announced earlier this month that he formed an exploratory committee for the Republican nomination.

Some findings that could work against Sanders present themselves in a breakdown of what New Hampshire voters seek in their ideal candidate. Sanders, whose platform includes far-left ideas like ""Medicare for All"" and tuition-free college, could frustrate the 85 percent of respondents who agreed the president should make an effort to work with the other party.

Polling also found that a plurality of New Hampshire voters -- 40 percent -- put their ideal candidate somewhere in the 50s age range. Sanders is 77. By comparison, Trump is 72, Biden is 76, Warren is 69, Harris is 54, and Klobuchar is 58.

Trump's standing among all Granite State voters shows some vulnerability as 52 percent disapprove of him while 43 percent approve.

The entire poll was conducted Feb. 21-22 among 910 registered voters, contains a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, and its data was ""weighted based on 2016 voter model, age, party affiliation.""

Sanders declared his candidacy on Monday and raised roughly $6 million in the first 24 hours, outpacing his 2020 Democratic rivals. Sanders told The Young Turks he would look for a running mate ""who is maybe not of the same gender that I am, and maybe someone who might be a couple of years younger than me,"" which would please the 38 percent of New Hampshire voters who think a woman should be either president or vice president.

A RealClearPolitics average of Democratic primary polls puts Sanders in second place at 16.8 percent, behind Biden's 27.5 percent.

SACRAMENTO — The California Republican Party, battered by the 2018 midterms and anemic voter registration, has chosen Jessica Patterson, the first woman in its history, as chairwoman following a combative election Sunday that pitted loyalists of President Donald Trump against those from the party establishment.|

The election of Patterson, 38, a Latina mother of two and an ally of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), to lead the nation’s largest state GOP operation into the 2020 election cycle came at the close of a raucous three-day party convention that drew a record 1,500 grassroots delegates to Sacramento.

Story Continued Below

Patterson was the overwhelming choice of elected officials in the state. The CEO of California Trailblazers, a party recruitment and training program for candidates, she won the spot after a tense contest against two grassroots conservative activists who are both vocal backers of Trump: former Assemblyman Travis Allen and Steve Frank, a longtime party insider.

Speaking to delegates after winning a solid 54.6 percent of the votes on the first ballot, Patterson delivered a feisty call for unity — and a promise of future victories — to hungry members of the state GOP, which has been reduced to third-party status in California.

“Today, we are starting the next chapter in our party history,’’ she said. “We’re going to be about one thing: winning. We’re going to take the fight to Democrats. … We’re going to fight them in the precincts and we’re going to beat them in elections.”

In a nod to state Republicans calling for more diversity in their ranks, delegates on Sunday also elected Peter Kuo, an East Bay businessman who is an immigrant from Taiwan, to be its vice chairman and Greg Gandrud, who is openly gay, as its treasurer.

With Patterson’s victory, California Republicans will now be led by a roster of women: Marie Waldron heads the Assembly Republican caucus and Shannon Grove was recently named minority leader in the state Senate.

The dramatic shift in party leadership was cheered by Republican women, who said it signaled a much-needed boost for a party in decline.

“It gave me chills,” Beth Miller, a veteran communications consultant and a former press secretary in the administrations of Gov. Pete Wilson and President George H.W. Bush, said after Patterson’s victory. “She won decisively, and that means that a lot of people want a new direction. She’s come up through the party, and I’m so proud we have elected the first woman, a Latina, a millennial.”

Cassandra Pye, a former adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said: “I’m really excited … the board looks like California. We have to accept the fact that if we want to attract young voters, we’ve got to have young people at the front. She’s a young mom, she’s got a lot of energy. I love the optics.”

With the latest polls showing two-thirds of Californians disapproving of Trump’s job performance, state Republicans over the weekend wrestled with the question of how much to embrace the President — or hold him at arm’s length and emphasize California-based issues.

Patterson, who says she voted for Trump in 2016, urged the party to steer away from “national issues’’ and to focus in the next election cycle on matters like California’s high housing costs and taxes.

After her election, Patterson sidestepped questions from reporters about whether she would invite the president to California to campaign or raise money. “We’ll have to see how it works,” she said.

Even with the powerful backing of McCarthy, and the lion’s share of California elected officials and party leadership on her team, Patterson faced a weekend of attacks by activists on the far right who charged that she was as part of the failed “establishment” and “elite” in the GOP, which now has fewer registered voters than Democrats or those who have declared “no party preference.”

The tense atmosphere extended to the streets outside, where a altercation between “Make America Great Again” supporters and liberal activists occurred Saturday night outside a “Build the Wall” dinner sponsored by Tea Party activists a few blocks from the convention. Police moved in after demonstrators gathered outside, some wearing bandanas and some chanting, “We welcome immigrants here.”

And across the street from the convention on the steps of the California State Capitol, speakers in support of Allen’s grassroots campaign who wore “Trump 2020” gear and #MAGA hats mingled with members of the extremist and nationalist group Proud Boys as officers on horseback looked on. Speakers railed against “Communist” Democrats running the state, led chants of “Lock her up!” and sung along to a “Build the Wall’’ hip hop tune as rally participants waved signs urging Republicans to “Take Back California.”

Throughout the weekend, tensions also boiled over inside as candidates made impassioned pitches to activist delegates. “My friends told me it’s pretty ugly out there,” said Jim Brulte, the outgoing state party chairman.

Opponents of Patterson’s candidacy shouted “Drain the Swamp” and booed after she delivered a speech touting her endorsements from elected officials; a Frank proponent suggested that Patterson’s supporters had been “paid.” In his speech backing Patterson, San Diego talk show host Carl DeMaio accused Allen of being an “egomaniac” making lofty but undeliverable promises about his ability to lead Republicans in the next cycle.

Patterson, even while urging Republicans to reject divisive politics, repeatedly employed red-meat rhetoric in an effort to corral many of conservatives still on the fence.

“I know who the enemy is … they’re about 500 yard away, in that big white building,’’ she told one caucus, pointing to the Democratic-dominated State Capitol across the street. “Every single day, they come up with silly ideas. … They’re trying to take away our freedoms,’’ she added.

Former Rep. Darrell Issa, whose 49th Congressional District seat flipped to Democrat Mike Levin following his retirement last year, backed Patterson — and acknowledged the challenges facing the withered California GOP in a state where the president is historically unpopular.

The problem today, he told POLITICO, is that “as soon as you say you’re a Republican, you’re at a disadvantage.”

“So you’ve got to position it,’’ he said. “We want to show the party is much more inclusive … that we’re the party that is pro-business, that does not attack people of faith. If we make the party all about who’s in Washington … then, no.”

But Issa said the stakes were high regarding the leadership of the nation’s largest state Republican organization.

“It’s important nationally who our party chairman is,” he said. “We may be blue for a long time, but we’re still an economic engine. And if we’re not represented by both parties, Washington writes you off.”

Despite a consensus among Republican political consultants that Trump’s low approval ratings fueled across-the-ballot losses in November, support for the president was pervasive among party activists. John Cox — the 2018 Republican gubernatorial candidate, who didn’t vote for Trump, yet rode a Trump endorsement into the general election before enduring a historic loss — opened his speech to delegates by predicting to cheers that the president would win a second term.

Supporters of both Allen and Frank said they saw a vote for Patterson as an endorsement of inept party officials that had brought California Republicans to their current nadir, including McCarthy, a Bakersfield Republican.

But Demaio, the talk show host, said it was long past time for California Republicans to focus on California issues — and what he called the state’s mismanagement by Democrats in power — instead of Trump.

“You can go anti-Trump all you want, but at some point, don’t you have to hold the supermajority Democrats accountable here?’’ he said. “The chairman of the California Republican Party has to reinvent the Republican brand … at a time when the brand is also influenced by national politicians. There is a national party, there are national personalities, and we need to get back to issues facing our state.”

Democrats watching the scene rejoiced in the disarray and internecine warfare of the rival GOP, which holds no statewide offices and has been reduced to a minority in both houses of the state Legislature. They said the California GOP’s road to revival heading toward 2020 was blocked by the current occupant of the White House, no matter who was in charge of the state party.

“It’s the political Donner Party of the 21st Century,’’ said Bob Mulholland, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant. “Whether they like it or not, Trump is their national leader and that makes trouble for them. He’s too dominant to hide from.”

But Howie Hawkins wants to set th…","The question is whether the public will listen. Once widely accused of spoiling a presidential election that led to two wars, the Green Party has been mostly relegated to a political punchline, thanks in part to the foibles of its former leader Jill Stein. Now, the Green New Deal—which helped to differentiate the eco-socialists Greens from the Democrats—has been coopted. The Democrats are even warming to socialist ideas. So does America even need a Green Party anymore? Or does America need it now more than ever?



The Green Party barely registered notice in 1996 when it fielded its first presidential candidate, who only made it onto the ballot in 22 states. But four years later, nominee Ralph Nader qualified in 43 states and won about 2.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Because he drew 95,000 votes in Florida, the famously decisive state in that election, he was accused of handing the presidency to George W. Bush. Nader and his supporters—among others—reject the argument that he spoiled the election, but there’s no denying that the 2000 election established the Greens’ legitimacy and influence as a third party.

Nearly two decades later, the Green Party has lost some of both—though it might still have enough support to tip the results of a presidential election. The party’s two-time nominee, Jill Stein, received just .4 percent of the vote in 2012, but 1.1 percent in 2016. The latter was “enough votes to tip the scales for Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” claimed Vanity Fair. (More accurately, her vote total in the three key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania was higher than Trump’s margin of victory, but there’s no evidence that Stein’s supporters would have voted for Clinton otherwise. They may have chosen no one at all.) Stein also potentially compromised her party’s legitimacy with her connection to multiple scandals related to the Russia investigation—not to mention her curious comments on vaccines and the health affects of Wi-Fi.

Stein has suggested she won’t seek the party’s nomination in 2020, so there’s potential for a new Green voice. But it’s not yet clear who that will be. Aside from Hawkins and Schlakman, only 12 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Green Party nomination. It’s hard to tell which are serious. Kanye Deez Nutz West most likely is not. But Dario Hunter is, and he’s about as diverse as candidates come: black, gay, Iranian, and Jewish. He’s also an ordained rabbi, a former environmental attorney, and a school board member in Youngstown, Ohio. These qualities all make him an ideal new voice for the party, he said. “If we want to cut through the lack of attention given [to Greens], we need someone who has a loud and clear voice and a tough skin,” he said. “It takes a tough skin to be an openly gay black son-of-an immigrant Jewish rabbi.”

Why should there be attention given to Greens, though, now that Democrats have embraced the Green New Deal? Simple, said Hunter: “This Democratic version of the Green New Deal is watered down. It pales in comparison to ours.”",The Democrats Stole the Green Party’s Best Idea,Newrepublic.com,https://newrepublic.com/article/153127/democrats-stole-green-partys-best-idea

While the level of funding falls short of what President Donald Trump has demanded for his long-promised wall, it’s still a sizable amount that Democrats and Republicans have agreed to spend in two areas of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.

The bipartisan deal allows for the use of any barrier materials previously used, such as steel slats or levee wall systems. It bars the use of new designs, such as the concrete prototypes commissioned by the Trump administration, which continues to push for an extensive border wall but faces legal and congressional challenges after the president declared a national emergency to build it.

Related: Trump ready for first veto if Congress votes to disapprove of emergency

And see: How Trump wants to pay for the border wall after invoking a national emergency

The new 55 miles of barriers in Hidalgo and Starr counties likely will get built by companies with previous experience in this type of work, and these companies range from a privately held Texas firm to publicly traded Israeli contractors, according to experts. The firms have a history of giving money mostly to Republican politicians.

“Galveston contractor SLSCO is building some of the current sections in the RGV. If I had to guess, they would be likely to get future contracts as well,” said Reece Jones, author of the book “Violent Borders” and a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawai‘i.

SLSCO, founded by brothers Todd, Billy and Johnny Sullivan, scored a $166.8 million contract for a border-security project in December, as well as a $145 million deal in November.

Montana-based Barnard Construction Co., given its past experience, also could get a chance to build some of the 55 miles of barriers, according to James R. Phelps, a consultant, author and professor who teaches courses on homeland security at universities such as Nova Southeastern in Florida. Barnard in November won a $172 million contract to build 32 miles of replacement wall in Arizona.

Firms such as SLSCO and Barnard could be “go-to companies” for Customs and Border Protection, the agency that will award contracts for the work, Phelps said. “They know what they’re doing. They can get it done relatively quickly,” he said. CBP is expected to have companies compete for contracts for the 55 miles of barriers, as happened for past border projects. The agency declined to comment, and SLSCO and Barnard didn’t respond to requests for comment.

SLSCO’s three founders contributed significant amounts to individual Republican candidates’ committees or groups tied to the GOP during the 2018 election cycle, giving about $68,000 in total, according to Federal Election Commission filings. One of the founders, Johnny Sullivan, also donated $2,700 to longtime Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign committee.

Meanwhile, Barnard Construction founder Tim Barnard contributed about $82,000 to individual Republican candidates’ committees or groups tied to the GOP during the last cycle, according to FEC filings. He also gave $6,000 to three trade groups’ political action committees.

Roles for tech companies and concrete

Companies focused on high-tech border security look particularly well positioned, said Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at investment adviser Veda Partners.

“That’s probably the only place where money is going to actually be rolling out the door, and that’s a huge boon to the companies who are concentrating there,” she said. Democrats appear inclined to keep funding investment in video surveillance, drones and other “smart” tools, and the Trump administration has been promoting high tech, Treyz added.

Such companies include Elbit Systems of America, which has built high-tech border towers in Arizona. The U.S. subsidiary of Israel-based Elbit Systems Ltd. ESLT, +0.35% last month said it’s eager to construct towers in Texas and other border states, according to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram report. In the 2018 cycle, Elbit Systems of America CEO Raanan Horowitz contributed about $12,000 to individual Republican candidates’ committees or groups tied to the GOP, along with $1,000 to Illinois Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider’s committee.

Israel-based Magal Security Systems MAGS, -1.35% , which provides “perimeter intrusion detection systems,” also might get involved. “Magal Security has built much of Israel’s Gaza wall and has been mentioned as a possible contractor for the U.S. wall,” the University of Hawai‘i’s Jones said. The company, listed in Israel and the U.S., has talked up building a “smart” fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, and its shares rallied after Trump’s election but have since pulled back.

The six companies that constructed wall prototypes in 2017 still might end up involved in upcoming border projects given they’ve gone through a traditional bid process and have the feel of “vetted, secure builders,” said Treyz of Veda Partners. They probably would propose “different barriers than we’ve seen thus far,” in part because their designs all reportedly failed key tests, she added. Those six companies were Texas Sterling Construction Co., Fischer Sand & Gravel Co., KWR Construction Inc., Caddell Construction Co., W.G. Yates & Sons Construction Co. and ELTA North America, whose parent company, Israel Aerospace Industries, is on track to have its stock floated on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

Concrete companies such as Texas-based U.S. Concrete Inc. USCR, +2.39% , Alabama-based Vulcan Materials Co. VMC, +1.86% and North Carolina’s Martin Marietta Materials MLM, +1.50% also might get business from the 55 miles of barriers, even if the barriers are largely made of steel slats or pipes, said Phelps, the professor of homeland security.

“The pipes are actually set in concrete,” he told MarketWatch. “While we may not put a concrete wall above ground, you can’t just stick pipes in the ground and tamp the dirt in around them.”

U.S. Concrete, Vulcan and Martin Marietta didn’t respond to requests for comment. In 2017, U.S. Concrete CEO Bill Sandbrook signaled that his company was interested in bidding for wall-related work.

Bernstein Research in 2016 predicted that Cemex CX, -1.21% , a big seller of cement, concrete and other materials, was best positioned to benefit from Trump’s proposed wall. Phelps, however, was downbeat on the Mexican heavyweight’s prospects when it comes to the $1.375 billion promised for new barriers.

“Trump has been adamant about keeping money in the United States,” he said. “Even though Cemex has a huge U.S. component to their business, the fact is they’re a Mexican company.”

The U.S. provides 25% of Cemex’s annual revenue, above Mexico’s 22% and more than any other country.

The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, a trade group whose leadership includes executives from U.S. Concrete, Vulcan, Martin Marietta and Cemex, contributed about $433,000 to federal candidates or party committees during the 2018 election cycle, with Republicans receiving 89% of the money.

That’s according to data from OpenSecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics that’s run by a nonpartisan research group, the Center for Responsive Politics. Vulcan and its affiliates contributed about $390,000 to candidates or party groups, with 58% of that going to the GOP and 42% to Democrats, while OpenSecrets.org’s figures show zero or minimal donations by the other two U.S. concrete companies. Cemex’s PAC gave $289,000 to federal candidates, with 83% of that going to Republicans and 17% to Democrats.

When President Donald Trump tweeted, on January 20, that he had reached 50 percent approval among Hispanic-Americans, most fair-minded observers reacted with skepticism, if not outright disbelief. Trump was, after all, still the same man who announced his candidacy by accusing Mexico of sending “rapists” across the border, the same man who ordered refugee children separated from their parents, the same man who has made building a wall to shut out migrants the focal point of his presidency. Yet here he was, crowing characteristic bravado: “Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.”

So, when even the pollsters responsible for the data Trump was touting—Marist Institute for Public Opinion, for NPR and ""PBS NewsHour""—cautioned of the high margin of error for that subset, and a possible over-sampling of Republicans, many on the left promptly dismissed it as an anomaly.

Story Continued Below

One month later, however, and Trump is making an aggressive play for Hispanic-American votes in Florida and beyond. Meanwhile, polls suggest Marist might have been onto something—and that Democrats should be worried that Hispanic voters could help reelect Trump and keep the Senate in Republican control. If so, it would be a cosmic twist of fate: A party that has staked its future on a belief that America’s demographic picture is changing decidedly in its favor could find itself losing to a man whose politics of fear should be driving precisely those voters into the Democrats’ waiting arms.

In theory, the rosy predictions that once gave rise to chest-beating liberal books like “The Emerging Democratic Majority” are proving true: 2020 will be the first U.S. election in which Hispanics make up the largest racial or ethnic minority in the electorate, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew estimates that 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote—a full 2 million more than eligible black voters and more than 13 percent of the electorate. Hispanics figure to constitute at least 11 percent of the national vote, as they did in 2016 and 2018.

Many expected Hispanics to vote overwhelmingly against Trump in 2016. A Latino Decisions poll conducted just before the 2016 presidential election found Trump had the support of just 18 percent of Hispanics. But the actual figure was 28 percent, which—given Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about immigrants—some analysts and pundits refused to believe from exit polls until further studies confirmed it. That was just as good as Mitt Romney, as the 2012 Republican nominee, did with Hispanics—and it was enough to help Trump squeak an Electoral College victory.

If Hillary Clinton had improved her share of the Hispanic vote by just 3 percentage points in Florida (from 62 percent to 65 percent of the Hispanic vote) and Michigan (from 59 percent to 62 percent), she would have won both states and their combined 45 Electoral College votes. That would have been enough to make her president. Slightly bigger swings—let alone the Democrats’ 88 percent-8 percent margin among African-Americans—could have added Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin into the blue column as well.

Now, here’s the brutal truth for Democrats: If Hispanic Americans are in fact showing surging approval of Trump, he could be on his way to matching or exceeding the 40 percent won by George W. Bush in his 2004. If Trump does 12 percentage points better than his 2016 numbers with the growing Hispanic vote, it pretty much takes Florida, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina off the table for Democrats, who would need to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House. At the same time, that 12-point shift would give Trump a clear shot at winning Colorado and Nevada, states where Hispanic voters make up well over 10 percent of the electorate and where Clinton won by 5 percentage points or less in 2016.

And if the Democratic path to the presidency looks hard without overwhelming Hispanic support, control of the Senate looks almost impossible. Any realistic scenario to gaining the necessary three seats—four if Trump retains the presidency—requires Democrats to defeat incumbents Cory Gardner in Colorado and Martha McSally in Arizona. Both states have higher than average Hispanic electorates. Gardner won his seat in 2014 by evenly splitting the Hispanic vote. McSally, who was just appointed to succeed John McCain, narrowly lost her 2018 race to Kyrsten Sinema by winning 30 percent of the Hispanic vote in her state. Any improvement among Hispanics for Republicans—or even just a lack of enthusiasm for turning out to vote against Trump—could easily return Gardner and McSally to the Senate and leave Democrats in the minority.



***

Let’s take a closer look at the numbers.

A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found Trump’s approval rebounding to 45 percent overall, with Hispanic approval jumping sharply—to 42 percent, after bottoming out at 22 percent on January 21. That result, like the early Marist number, suffers from a high margin of error. A more conservative rolling average puts the figure at around 35 percent, and rising.

Other polls also show Trump in the mid-30s with Hispanics. An Economist/YouGov poll found 32 percent approval rating among Hispanics; another from The Hill and HarrisX has it at 35 percent. In mid-January, Reuters/Ipsos found his approval among Hispanics at 36 percent, the highest since the 2016 election.

That’s about where Trump’s Hispanic approval spent most of 2018, according to previous POLITICO/Morning Consult polls, but about 10 points above where Reuters/Ipsos and Gallup polling showed him throughout the year. Whether keeping pace or on the rise, these polls suggest that Hispanics are responding to Trump as president more like Americans as a whole—close to 45 percent of whom approve of Trump—than like African-Americans, whose Trump approval remains around 10 percent.

That doesn’t necessarily translate into votes, Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. Despite that 50 percent approval rate, his poll found that only 27 percent of Hispanics said that they definitely plan to vote for Trump in 2020, with 58 percent definitely voting against him. Still, a definite 27 percent, if accurate, is equal to the percentage of Hispanic voters who chose Trump in 2016 (28 percent), or Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012 (27 percent), or Republicans in the 2018 congressional midterms (29 percent).

There appears to be room for growth. Morning Consult’s polling showed Trump approval among Hispanics at or above 40 percent for much of his first year in office, perhaps in something of a grace period, to which he could return.

And remember: pollsters in 2016 thought Trump would get only about 18 percent of the Hispanic vote; he actually got 28 percent. If polls are, for some reason, still underestimating his appeal among Hispanics by a similar margin, he could be on his way to 40 — and reelection.



***

So why might Trump be suddenly surging with Hispanic voters?

It’s easy to assume that all Hispanic-Americans must detest and disapprove of the president who derides and vilifies immigrants coming across the southern border. But that hasn’t been the reality. Hispanics make up a large, diverse population that does not act as a monolith.

As a whole, Hispanic-Americans are becoming politically more and more like non-Hispanic white Americans. Two-thirds of the Hispanic electorate is now American-born, and Hispanic voters are far more likely to approve of Trump than naturalized immigrants, according to Pew Research Center data. They remain more Democratic than non-Hispanic white voters in part because so many of them are young adults and share many of their generation’s progressive views.

But as FiveThirtyEight recently noted, Hispanic Democrats are considerably less liberal than others in the party. Hispanics make up about 12 percent of those who identify as Democrats or who tend to lean Democratic; but they are 22 percent of Democrats who describe themselves as moderate or conservative. Hispanics, roughly half of whom are Catholic (and another quarter who are former Catholics), skew conservative on social issues, including abortion.

After Trump’s midterms misfire of trying to rally the Republican base through immigrant-bashing, there is evidence, too, that the 2020 playbook will return to the more tried-and-true method of characterizing Democrats as extreme leftists. He, and other leading Republicans, are criticizing Democrats more on abortion, taxes and “socialist” positions on health care and climate change. He’s also made a targeted appeal to Cuban-Americans in Florida by vocally supporting the overthrow of Nicolás Maduro, the socialist dictator in Venezuela. There is good reason to think that those efforts will be effective on Hispanic voters—or, at least, effective enough.

The Democratic Party hasn’t been wowing them. Hispanic approval of congressional Democrats, and of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer individually, is poor. There are few, if any, elected Democratic Hispanics who are national household names. After Clinton passed on the opportunity to put a Latino on the national ticket in 2016, the 2020 presidential field has just one Hispanic in the mix: Julián Castro, who has been overshadowed by a white fellow Texan, Beto O’Rourke.

Meanwhile, Democrats’ hope of a deal to protect Dreamers — immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children — ended with nothing to show for it. Immigration reform and labor issues have taken a back seat in the Democratic-controlled House to climate change, health care, and gun control—similar to what happened the last time Democrats took control of the House, in 2009.

And most importantly, things are pretty good for most Hispanic-Americans. Trump is correct that they have enjoyed record-low unemployment rates, notwithstanding a small uptick at the start of this year. And, despite all of Trump’s rhetoric, and the fear it induced, not much has changed for most Hispanic families in the U.S. Deportations are a little down from Obama administration peaks, while immigrant arrests are a little up.

The good economy might be Obama’s doing more than Trump’s, but regardless, it’s a powerful incentive to keep the current political leadership in place.

None of this is to suggest that Hispanics are entering a prolonged love affair with Trump. But it does mean that the eventual Democratic nominee can’t simply assume that Hispanic voters will flock to the polls to prevent Trump's second term. If anything, the challenge for the party looks tougher than in 2016—when it arguably cost them the White House.",Trump’s Secret to Victory in 2020: Hispanic Voters,Politico,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/24/2020-hispanic-voters-donald-trump-225192

Matt Duss, Sanders' foreign policy adviser, spoke with INSIDER about the senator's global affairs priorities. Duss also addressed som…","It's been less than a week since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he's running for president again and he's already dominating headlines about the 2020 race in a broad, diverse field of candidates.

Sanders in 2016 went from being a relatively obscure leftist figure to a household name and one of the most popular politicians in the country. His campaign for the presidency was ultimately unsuccessful, but he left his mark on both the Democratic Party and the country by making ideas previously considered radical in the realm of US politics fairly mainstream.

But as Sanders was frequently criticized in 2016 for having a somewhat jumbled approach to foreign policy. Early on, his campaign website didn't have a foreign policy section, and he stumbled on the topic during presidential debates.

Since 2016, however, Sanders has dedicated a significant amount of his time and energy to global affairs.

He's delivered two major speeches on foreign policy, one at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in October 2018 and another in September 2017 at Westminster College— where Winston Churchill gave his infamous ""Iron Curtain"" speech.

Sanders is also leading the charge on a Senate resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

Matt Duss, 46, has been at Sanders' side as his foreign policy adviser throughout this shift, and he'll be helping the senator craft his approach to global affairs along the campaign trail.

Duss, a staunch progressive who broke into the political world as a blogger, has gained prominence among left-leaning foreign policy wonks and added significant credibility to Sanders on matters of global import.

Read more: Bernie Sanders slams US support for 'despotic' Saudi Arabia in Yemen and bashes Trump over Khashoggi: 'No more! Enough death. Enough killing.'

Sanders' bold approach to domestic politics is reflected in his views on foreign affairs, which at times makes him a fringe figure in Congress. In recent days, for example, he's been criticized by some congressional Democrats for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader and for not referring to Nicolas Maduro as a dictator.

Duss spoke with INSIDER last week, offering an intimate view into how Sanders sees the world and what the senator will be prioritizing along the campaign trail. He also addressed the criticism Sanders has received on the subject of foreign policy, and why he feels much of it is unfounded.

Editor's Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

INSIDER: Sanders faced a fair amount of criticism in 2016 for not having a clear foreign policy vision. How has Sanders evolved since and has he made it more of a priority?

Duss: He certainly has made it more of a priority. There's a great deal of evidence for that, not only in the statements he's made, speeches he's given, but also substantively and legislatively. The Yemen war powers resolution is the most prominent example of [Sanders] being more aggressive on the issue of foreign policy and adding it to the progressive agenda.

Coming out of 2016, we recognized that he had a much bigger platform, a much bigger opportunity to move things in a progressive direction and the importance of making foreign policy part of that, which is why he asked me to join the staff.

INSIDER: There are strong anti-interventionist sentiments on both sides of the aisle right now. Barack Obama was fairly critical of the US in a similar way back in 2008, but faced accusations of being unpatriotic as a result. Could Sanders face similar attacks?

Duss: He certainly will. We're seeing it right now with some of the attacks he's getting even from some Democrats on Venezuela.

But there are shared concerns amongst progressives and conservatives about American militarism, the costs, and many unintended consequences of this kind of interventionism that has guided our approach certainly since 9/11, but even before that.

The Yemen resolution, the fact that [Sanders] introduced it with Republican Mike Lee as an original co-sponsor as well as Democrat Chris Murphy — that's an illustration of this, right? Sen. Sanders and Sen. Lee don't agree on a great deal, but they strongly came together around this idea that not only do we need to take a hard look at some of these interventions we're supporting, but we also need to take a hard look and reassert Congress' constitutional authority over these interventions.

This is where you see a sharp difference between Trump's approach and Sen. Sanders' approach. Trump and a lot of the conservatives who support him see international relations in very zero-sum terms: If someone else is winning the US is losing; the US needs to dominate all these relationships.

Sen. Sanders does not see it in those terms, he sees it in very much a positive-sum way: We can all gain when we are working together, multilaterally. We have shared problems and challenges, so we need shared solutions.

INSIDER: You recently told The Nation what it meant to you when in 2008 you heard Obama say he didn't just want to end the Iraq War, he wanted to end ""the mind-set"" that got the US into the war in the first place. But once he entered the White House, Obama encountered a reality that made it difficult to deliver on his campaign's idealistic foreign policy vision. If elected, could Sanders face a similar reality as president?

Duss: That statement [from Obama] meant a lot to me and a lot of other young progressives that I know for a reason — it really captured something.

But let's remember that when Obama came into office he had a financial crisis. There was a lot going on and Obama had an idealistic idea of turning the ship on a number of things, including foreign policy. I don't ding him too hard for some of the decisions he made, they made a great deal of sense at the time. In retrospect, some of the decisions led to really problematic outcomes now, such as the decision not to investigate fully the use of torture or other things like that.

Any president has to deal with the world as it is when they take office. But what Sen. Sanders recognizes is building that kind of movement around this idea, and starting a much more robust conversation and a real political consensus about what America's role in the world should be.

Now that's challenging, right? Because foreign policy is not something that is very immediate to a lot of Americans for obvious reasons, but grounding it in this discussion about how we treat ourselves, how we treat our own society, what kind of society we want it, how that is reflected in our foreign policy is the way to go about it.

INSIDER: Congress essentially abdicated its war-making authority with the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in 2001 — which has since allowed presidents to wage an expansive, ill-defined, global war on terrorism with few obstacles. Will Sanders call for repealing the AUMF along the campaign trail?

Duss: He will be focusing on that. He has said that Yemen is important in itself because it's a humanitarian crisis. The US shouldn't be supporting the Saudi coalition.

There's the constitutional question of congressional oversight and of reining in these wars, and that relates to the broader set of issues about the 2001 AUMF and the global war on terror. He will be talking about these things.

INSIDER: Does the Yemen resolution have a realistic shot in the Senate? Does Sanders' forceful criticism of Trump jeopardize the fate of the resolution?

Duss: It does have a realistic chance. We have 51 of the 56 who voted with us in December — they're still in office. Plus we have two new members of the Democratic caucus, both of whom have indicated that they will vote with the caucus, which puts us at 53. We only need 51 votes to move through every stage of this process.

The Trump administration will put a lot of pressure on Republicans to peel off this thing. But it's the same resolution that passed two months ago. The humanitarian crisis [in Yemen] has only gotten worse.

INSIDER: Sanders' criticism of Israel, particularly on the debate stage in 2016, is notable for multiple reasons. He's Jewish and less susceptible to accusations of anti-Semitism. But it's politically risky. Does Sanders want to radically alter the US-Israel relationship or is he more concerned with the rights of Palestinians and related humanitarian issues?

Duss: I don't think he wants to radically reorient the relationship. He's been clear he supports Israel's right to exist, he supports the two state solution.

But going back to that debate you mentioned, his point about [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] has been borne out many, many times. We just saw this week with Netanyahu literally forming an alliance with fascists, people who are identified as terrorists.

But the approach [Sanders] would support, and has supported, is one that is consistent with our relationships with other countries, which is to say: we support the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in security and dignity. And we have to recognize when policy, for example the settlements or the occupation, undermine those goals. So the US needs to speak clearly about that and when necessary we need to take steps to put pressure to stop those policies. [Sanders is] going to be willing to do that.

INSIDER: Sanders has been accused of being too soft on dictatorial leaders like Fidel and Raul Castro, Daniel Ortega, and more recently Nicolas Maduro. Is any of this criticism fair?

Duss: There are times where he's definitely pushed back on some of the reflexive hawkishness of the establishment. But he's always been consistently for human rights and self-determination.

His statement on Maduro, if you go back to what he initially said, reflects that. He's very clear about Maduro's abuse of his population and the corruption.

But that doesn't mean that we endorse Trump's approach here. It's making sure that the approach is consistent and grounded in a set of principles — human dignity, human security.

INSIDER: Sanders is also facing criticism for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as the legitimate leader in Venezuela, including from Democrats in Congress, as the US and many of its allies take a stand against Maduro. From the senator's perspective, how should the US approach the crisis in Venezuela?

Duss: No one is defending Maduro — the senator certainly is not doing that.

But coming out as Trump has done and sort of putting the US in the lead — just completely recognizing Guaidó as the president— and putting the US four-square behind the opposition, has the potential to create some possible outcomes that the US is not quite prepared for.

There are also other people the US could be talking to. It's unfortunate that the Trump administration did not pursue the opening with Cuba that the Obama administration started, because talking to Cuba right now could actually be really useful.

INSIDER: That's an interesting point because Trump is clearly open to dialogue with North Korea, and has defended the notion of talking to your enemies, even as he went after Obama over reopening dialogue Cuba and Iran. What's Sanders' view on this?

Duss: Sen. Sanders was perhaps the only member of the Democratic office to actually compliment Trump's last summit with Kim Jong Un for that reason. Talking is better than threats.

INSIDER: So, if we ultimately have a President Bernie Sanders, would we also see more dialogue with America's geopolitical adversaries?

Duss: We certainly would. We'd be clear about the values and the outcomes the US favors — self-determination and human rights, respect for people's dignity and their security.

But the fact is the US is extraordinarily powerful and we don't have to fear sitting down with anyone, whether it's the North Koreans, whether it's Iran, whomever.

INSIDER: Trump has a record of praising dubious world leaders and Sanders has referred to the president as an ""authoritarian."" Do you agree with the senator?

Duss: [Trump] is certainly behaving in authoritarian ways. There's some ways in which he is being constrained.

But certainly using the bully pulpit, the huge megaphone that he has on Twitter and elsewhere, to attack the press, to attack progressives, to attack all kinds of people — these have consequences.

We've seen violence against the media. We saw this guy who was just arrested planning this huge attack.

Leaders in other countries take notice of what the president of the US says. In talking to activists in other countries, there is no question in their mind that they feel that their oppression and [their leader's] use of these tools to control, oppress, and persecute their own people is being affirmed by the president of the US. That's a huge problem.

INSIDER: If you had to summarize Sanders' worldview as succinctly as possible, what would you say?

Duss: He sees the US as a kind of global facilitator by virtue of our enormous economic, diplomatic power. The US has the ability to bring parties, states, and people around tables to address common challenges that really no other country has.

That doesn't mean that the US needs to run to the head of every parade or be in charge of everything — certainly not. But the US does have a role to play in facilitating multilateral cooperation, conversation, and innovation.",Q&A WITH MATT DUSS: Bernie Sanders' foreign policy adviser breaks down the senator's progressive global agenda for 2020,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-duss-bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-adviser-2019-2

The Senate on Monday rejected a bill making it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect an infant who survives an “attempted abortion,” part of a Republican effort to squeeze Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.

The vote split mainly along party lines, 53-44. Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia crossed the aisle to vote for it; no Republicans broke ranks. Sixty votes are required for the bill to advance.

“Evidently the far left is no longer convinced that all babies are created equal,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

Ahead of the vote, the bill’s Republican sponsors and outside anti-abortion groups lobbying for its passage made it clear that the intent of Monday’s vote was to undermine the growing pool of Senate Democrats running for president.

In a speech just before the vote, bill author Sen. Ben Sasse quoted campaign stump speeches by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and independent Bernie Sanders vowing to look out for society’s “voiceless and vulnerable” and accused them of hypocrisy for opposing his bill’s regulations for the care of newborns.

""Was that all just clap track for the campaign trail and for soundbites? Or do people mean the stuff that they say around here?"" he said of his colleagues with White House aspirations.

Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group closely allied with Hill Republicans and the Trump administration, said Monday that it was “watching this vote closely to see whether leading Democratic candidates for president in 2020 will go on the record for or against infanticide.”

""This bill is important in itself but it‘s also important as a setup for the coming election, where there will be a stark contrast between the president of the United States and any one of the Democratic nominees,"" SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an interview. She stood just outside the Senate chamber lobbying senators as they entered to cast their votes.

Sanders, Harris, Warren, Booker and Gillibrand all voted against the measure. Sherrod Brown, another Democratic senator exploring a White House bid, complained to POLITICO that the vote was held in bad faith.

""This is pure Mitch McConnell. It's all aimed at keeping his base in line, while the president grows increasingly unpopular,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're not doing infrastructure, we're not doing health care. We're not doing anything that matters to help our country. It's just votes on abortion and other kinds of divisive votes he's going to bring.""

Democrats and reproductive rights advocates blasted the bill, saying it's already a felony to harm or neglect an infant and that the “medically irresponsible” bill would restricts doctors from making case-by-case decisions about what is best for infants and mothers.

""This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed — because that is not up for debate and it is already the law,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""This bill is government interference in women’s health care, in families’ lives, and in medicine on steroids.""

The bill was previously introduced in the House by now-Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Sasse first tried to force a vote on it earlier this month, capitalizing on a wave of outrage among conservatives after New York loosened its restrictions on third-trimester abortions and embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave an interview defending similar efforts in his state.

Democrats led by Murray objected to that fast-track procedure and blocked a floor vote, prompting Republicans to vow to try again.

Susan B. Anthony list said earlier this month that even though the Senate lacks the votes to pass abortion restrictions, it should continue to hold votes to put pressure on Democrats and divide the caucus. The move is part of a larger strategy designed to maintain current abortion restrictions while revving up the GOP’s conservative base ahead of 2020 and courting independents who may be turned off by Democrats' position on abortion rights.

""We're seeing a gradual movement to hammer a wedge right into the middle of the Democratic Party, and at some point soon here, they're just going to have to cry mercy,"" Dannenfelser said.","Senate defeats anti-abortion bill, as GOP tries to jam Dems",Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/senate-defeats-anti-abortion-bill-1185531

Nomiki Konst, the 35-year-old TV pundit casting herself as the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the New York public advocate’s race, readily acknowledges that her background is politically unconventional.

She’s wandered from Tucson to Buffalo to Florida to Los Angeles to New York City, from one cause to the next. It’s all, her aides say, part of a bildungsroman that naturally culminates in a run for an office that’s second in line to the mayor of the biggest city in America.

Story Continued Below

Like Ocasio-Cortez, Konst has not risen through traditional Democratic channels. She identifies as a Democratic Socialist. Her campaign depicts her as one in a movement of millennial women finding their voices. But for someone campaigning for a job to keep fellow city leaders honest, her own personal history is hard to pin down.

“The last decade and a half have been very tumultuous for millennials,” Konst told POLITICO.

Konst came to POLITICO’s office on Tuesday to discuss her background and her aspirations for the office of public advocate. POLITICO followed up with 19 fact-checking questions that same night. Citing debate preparations, she declined to answer those questions, some simple queries like what year she graduated from college, and how much of her life she spent in Tucson. The campaign ultimately declined to answer many of the questions.

“Given that this election is less than 4 days away, it is simply impossible to accommodate this request on this timeline,” emailed campaign manager Dominique Shuminova on Thursday evening.

Certain things are clear: She is a sometimes-magnetic TV personality who spent two years roving the country for The Young Turks, an openly ideological news outlet that is, in many ways, the left’s answer to Breitbart.

She can credibly lay claim to being a social media “influencer,” with a robust Twitter following of 84,000. And she has a peripatetic background populated by ventures that have gone bust: from an aborted run to succeed Gabby Giffords in Congress in Arizona, to the founding of a now-defunct Los Angeles civic organization, to the creation of a now-defunct journalism enterprise.

Konst has an uncanny ability to ingratiate herself with influential people, and she is adept at getting herself on TV, where she appears poised and eager to throw rhetorical bombs. She’s demonstrated a Zelig-like ability to appear around insurgent Democratic primary candidates in New York.

In the 17-person race to succeed now-Attorney General Letitia James as public advocate — a race that will be decided in a special election next Tuesday — she also appears to be making some headway.

In the last month, Konst has raised more money than the other candidates, bringing in more than $80,000 in donations. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s press secretary has donated to her. So have Susan Sarandon and Rosario Dawson. Renee Cafaro — a progressive heir to a real estate development fortune and a former aide to former Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and former Gov. David Paterson — hosted a fundraiser for Konst at her Plaza Hotel spread earlier this year.

“She has a real grassroots feel to her, which I love,” Cafaro said.

Konst’s campaign manager helped state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi defeat Independent Democratic Conference leader Jeff Klein in 2018.

And Konst was one of just seven candidates to have raised and spent enough money to appear in Wednesday’s public advocate debate, during which she aggressively attacked the other candidates, accusing them of taking donations from real estate developers. She even suggested that NY1 moderator Errol Louis, who threatened to cut her mic after interrupting other candidates, was trying to “silence women.” (Louis didn’t cut the mic as he did for Bo Dietl in the 2017 mayoral debate.)

“I think the people who come from our side of the left kind of organize quietly,” Konst said. “And then sometimes the establishment doesn’t necessarily see what’s happening.”

The Nomiki Konst story begins in Tucson, where she was born. She moved to Buffalo with her family when she was eight. Her mom was an Erie County legislator. Konst attended Nichols School, a private prep school in Buffalo.

Much of the rest of her life remains occluded by imprecision.

Konst says she attended the University of Arizona but declined to say if she graduated. Inquiries to the university were not returned.

She was also briefly an actor and says she was an Obama organizer. In news articles and television appearances over the past decade, she has been described using more than 30 different titles, from “former blogger” to “film industry activist” to “pro-Sanders journalist.”

She founded Alliance Hollywood, an organization whose mission was, according to an archived version of its website, to act as “the voice of entertainment on Capitol Hill.” Konst’s LinkedIn page says she founded it in 2007. In an interview, Konst said “2009, I believe.” The organization no longer exists.

“I’m really bad with dates,” she said Tuesday.

By 2011, the organization was describing itself as “a DC non-profit corporation.” POLITICO has been unable to find evidence that the organization registered as a nonprofit. Konst’s campaign declined to provide any documentation either. Nor would she say where the group's funding came from. Neither did she say what it did, aside from the handful of events documented on its Flickr page.

In 2011, Konst says she moved to New York City.

“I think I’ve lived in over 12 apartments [since then],” she said.

Since 2011, however, she has also lived in Arizona. In 2012, she started showing up in Tucson papers as a candidate to succeed Gabby Giffords after a gunman shot the congresswoman.

“I really don’t know any other home other than Tucson,” Konst said at the time.

She failed to make the ballot. More recently she disputed that she really ran for the seat, both in the interview with POLITICO and at a debate among the candidates running for public advocate this week, where she was asked by another candidate how she could call herself an outsider candidate if she had run for Congress before.

“I was never on the ballot. I did not run,” Konst said.

At some point after her Congressional bid, she returned to New York and got involved in the ultimately successful campaign to ban fracking here.

Josh Fox, the anti-fracking filmmaker who made ""Gasland"", says they met in 2011, at a party in Los Angeles for his Oscar-nominated documentary.

“Nomi was there because she was working on fracking, working on those issues,” he said. Fox said he met her again in 2013, on the anti-fracking campaign, and then again when both served on the Democratic National Convention's platform committee. Konst also served on ""Unity Reform Commission,” established in the aftermath of the 2016 Democratic primary, in an effort to restore faith in the DNC’s nomination process and management.

Around 2013, Konst says she founded the Accountability Project, an attempt at a local nonprofit investigative journalism outlet, with the late journalist Wayne Barrett, whom she has frequently referred to as a “mentor.” (Her LinkedIn profile says the project began in 2012 and lasted two years).

“Wayne had trained me,” Konst told POLITICO. “He taught me everything about investigative reporting. We would sit there for hours in his living room.”

Barrett ended up getting sick, ultimately dying in 2017. Funding dried up. The Accountability Project shuttered. Several people who spoke with POLITICO said Konst and Barrett did work together on the project and Barrett recommended reporters for Konst to hire. Barrett’s widow, Fran, declined comment, citing her work for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“That was probably where I learned the greatest tricks from the most recent greatest investigative reporter of our time, Wayne Barrett, who I was very close to,” she said in a recent interview with Gotham Gazette’s Ben Max and City Limits’ Jarrett Murphy.

But in an interview with POLITICO, Konst clarified that she did not do reporting for the Accountability Project. She describes herself as an “investigative reporter,” because of her work for The Young Turks.

Konst could point to two pieces The Accountability Project produced — a heavily disputed article about the former head of an anti-corruption body Cuomo created in 2013, and another about Bronx party bosses. She also hosted an apparently short-lived but “big deal” podcast for the project. A Soundcloud page for the podcast shows just five episodes. She declined to disclose how many subscribers it had or how many episodes it produced.

Konst frequently argues that the Public Advocate’s office needs someone with her investigative skills.

Steven Weiss, a reporter and a former Wayne Barrett intern who worked with Konst on the Accountability Project, said he was impressed with Konst’s work and her managerial skills.

“I do know that Wayne Barrett thought well of her, spent at least dozens of hours with or speaking to her, and recommended her to others he cared for and respected, as the manager of that process and organization,” Weiss said.

But, he added, ""As to her claim of being an investigative journalist, specifically, and whether Wayne would agree with that characterization of her work, I've not seen or heard anything that would suggest that she was, or that he would.""

Konst says that it was while touting the Accountability Project on TV that she gained steam as a talking head. By 2015, she was making frequent appearances on CBS and Fox News as a Democratic political strategist and expert on national politics, particularly on fighting within the Democratic Party during the 2016 presidential primary. For the most part, the television appearances were unpaid, she told POLITICO.

At various points along the way, Konst said she also campaigned to draft Joe Biden for president and joined the Truman Center, which advocates for “tough, smart national security solutions,” according to its website.

Though Konst has touted her role as a “partner” at the organization in her Young Turks profile and her Huffington Post bio, on Tuesday she said that her role there, as well as her membership in the New Leaders Council, were meaningless.

Partners at the Center write their own online profiles, according to Truman Center spokesperson Graham West, and Konst’s said she was also the group’s West Coast Managing Director of Partnerships. That bio has since been deleted.

“We don't have any records of [that job] ever existing,” said another Truman Center spokesperson Ryan Cahill, though his colleague West noted that, “Nomiki's involvement at Truman essentially predates the employment of everyone currently on staff given organizational turnover."" Her membership, Cahill added, has lapsed.

“That was literally something that was killed in like three days,” Konst said, referring to the West Coast Managing Director of Partnerships position.

“It literally means nothing,” she said Tuesday. “If there’s any way for me to explain it to you, these organizations are nothing. They just basically go around the country and try to get young people involved and come to their conferences.”

She says she worked in Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, but one day after POLITICO asked her for details on that particular claim, she had yet to provide any.

For the past two years, Konst worked at The Young Turks, where she filed dispatches from Flint, Mich., Puerto Rico post-hurricane Maria, and East Chicago, until she was laid off in June of 2018. While working for the Young Turks, she says she was bombed in the Dakotas, amid protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

“I was at Standing Rock in the water when there were like bombs being thrown at us, literally, where a woman got her arm ripped off and she still is paralyzed in one arm,” she said, in possible reference to protester Sophia Wilansky, whose arm was damaged by shrapnel of indeterminate origin.

She also hosted a radio show called “The Filter” on SiriusXM.

She describes herself on her campaign website as an “award-winning investigative journalist.” Asked to specify, her campaign said she participated in a Citizens Union panel entitled, “Recognizing New York Journalists Who Make Democracy Work,” after which she and other panelists were awarded glass apples with their names on them.

After leaving The Young Turks last summer, she worked for Our Revolution, the non-profit 501c4 organization started by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders after his 2016 campaign for president.

Konst said there was no overlap between her employment by The Young Turks, for which she earned $42,000 in salary last year, and her employment by Our Revolution, which paid her $36,000, according to a disclosure form she filed with the City’s Conflicts of Interest Board. She says she’s now getting by on savings. On her income disclosure form, she identified herself as a self-employed journalist.

As a reporter for The Young Turks, Konst sometimes interviewed politicians whose campaigns she publicly supported, or activists whose political positions she openly agreed with. But Konst sees no dissonance between her political activism and her journalism.

“Politico was founded by Republicans,” Konst said. “The New York Times invented this in the late 1800s, invented this concept of non-partisan. And it was actually a PR stunt.”

POLITICO spokesperson Brad Dayspring said that is not accurate.

“POLITICO has been owned by Robert Allbritton since its launch 12 years ago. Robert is politically independent, or as he would say, ‘fiercely independent,’“ Dayspring said. “Robert’s editorial co-founders were John Harris and Jim VandeHei. John is currently POLITICO’s editor-in-chief and is also an Independent. While no longer with POLITICO, Jim VandeHei is, by all accounts, also an independent and advocated for a 3rd party candidate in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal in 2016.”

Konst says she first voted in a New York City election, at earliest, in 2016. City Board of Elections records indicate she first registered to vote in the 2018 fall primary elections in New York City, but her ballot was rejected on a technicality. She successfully cast her first vote in New York City in the general election in November 2018.

“I understand that people like to bring that up as a criticism of me, but at the end of the day, a lot of people who have been in office for a very long time have rezoned their neighborhoods and made it completely unaffordable to live in their neighborhoods,” she said. “And I think that’s more of an abomination, in terms of civics.”

Konst said she wasn’t registered to vote in New York City during the 2013 mayoral elections, for example, because she thought her vote might count more in a place like Arizona, a purple state.

In the event she’s elected, Konst would not be the first public advocate to struggle with accuracy. Tish James was known to misstate her age and falsely claimed to have a role in helping the New York Times report a story about a young homeless girl named Dasani.

Konst’s vision for public advocate is undeniably ambitious. She wants to decentralize the office, so there’s a deputy in every borough. She thinks the city’s Department of Investigation should be relocated under the auspices of public advocate. She wants to change the law so that the public advocate is no longer second in line to the mayor.

Former Clinton pollster Mark Penn told Fox News this morning there are a number of scenarios that may lead to a third Hillary candidacy.

﻿

After defending Clinton’s credentials as “one of the most experienced politicians around,” Penn went on to say of the reported recent confabs between Hillary and declared candidates, “Those meetings are going to be somewhat awkward because she hasn’t declared that she’s not definitely running, and she, in fact, at the same time is looking over the field and I think will make a decision later in the year whether or not to run herself.

Penn said the chances of Hillary running depends on how the field shapes up.

“If the party looks too far to the left and there’s no front runner, she’ll get in,” he said.

“I think if Joe Biden gets in, that probably means she won’t run if he gets in. If he doesn’t get in, I think the field will be open for her,” Penn said.

He went on to indicate Clinton has long despised the year before the election year, so that may underscore the point she will wait as long as she can to declare her candidacy.

Reuters indicates there are serious worries about the field moving left, which could leave room for a more moderate candidate:

Liberal Democratic presidential contenders’ rush to embrace the left’s most ambitious proposals has some Democrats worried there could be a price to pay when they try to defeat President Donald Trump next year.

Party activists have been energized as Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and other candidates endorsed plans to provide Medicare coverage to every American, some form of tuition-free college, a national $15 minimum wage and the so-called “Green New Deal” advocated by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

But Trump and his allies in the Republican Party have seized on those stances to attack the Democratic 2020 field as outside the American political mainstream — a claim the president plans to make throughout his re-election campaign, according to sources with knowledge of his strategy.

Some Democrats fear the argument has potency. They worry the primary may produce a nominee who will not appeal to centrist working and middle-class voters who voted for Trump in 2016 but whom Democrats believe they can win back.

“The big progressive programs are popular in a caucus or primary electorate, but probably don’t move the needle among voters who want to find someone who will change Washington by tilting the system to favor people in the middle — not the very rich or the very poor,” Jeff Link, an Iowa Democrat, tells Rueters.",PENN: Hillary back in if field 'too left'......,Theamericanmirror.com,https://www.theamericanmirror.com/ex-clinton-pollster-hillary-will-run-if-biden-doesnt-or-field-is-too-far-left/

In one document posted on Ocasio-Cortez's website (and later taken down), the Green New Deal was defined by a set of goals: achieving ""net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,"" moving America to 100 percent ""clean and renewable energy"" and realizing Franklin D. Roosevelt's vision of an Economic Bill of Rights by guaranteeing good-paying jobs, health care, education and housing for all, along with economic security for those unable to work.

Not every Democrat supports all those goals, by a long shot. As Whitehouse made clear in our conversation, the Green New Deal is in an early developmental stage and its exact policy content is likely to evolve considerably. But for many progressives, the Green New Deal establishes a positive agenda that can helps the Democratic Party emerge as something more than a catch-basin for everyone who opposes Donald Trump.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell apparently believes that forcing an early vote on the Green New Deal may damage Democrats politically, and some Democratic presidential candidates have been notably reluctant to embrace it. Whitehouse believes it's time for his party to seize the moment ... and change the world in the process.

He plans on being there when this legislation is enacted -- but not as the person who signs it.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and context.

Republicans have been reacting with -- I think ""terror"" would be an accurate word -- to the concept of a Green New Deal. Sen. Tom Cotton said the media's coverage of it has been Stalin-like. A deleted summary from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's website was entered into the congressional record. Rep. Liz Cheney has attacking it. Why are they so scared of this/

Well, I think it is significant to watch the Republican heads explode over it and to hear the invective and falsehood that are thrown at it. It reminds me a little bit about when Democrats were trying to set up Medicare years ago, and Republicans who were fighting Medicare insisted it was socialized medicine. This is a little bit the 2019 replay of that same Republican playbook. I do think that the Green New Deal brings new energy to the climate debate.

What [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is up to is to try to use the fact that we're still at an early stage in negotiating a climate bill amongst ourselves to try to foment division. When in fact, we have a very strong common Democratic purpose to work together to get a very significant climate bill passed.

What are your specific thoughts on the Green New Deal, in terms of your own individual interpretation of what it means and what should be included?

The Green New Deal at this point is only a resolution that hasn't even approached legislative language. Hearings have not yet been held. In the Senate alone, there are carbon-price bills on the Democrats side, ""Keep It in the Ground"" bills on the Democratic side -- a variety of smaller bills for different economic sectors that address climate change and the general prospect of a Green New Deal.

Our job as legislators is to walk through those various pieces of legislation, and pull something together that keep the 1.5-degree [increase] climate threshold that is most likely to actually get passed, and that maximizes all the collateral benefits for society in passing it as a significant climate bill.

From what I've read, both on Ocasio-Cortez's website, and in just in general from the progressive commentators, this is about more than just addressing climate change. It's about radically overhauling how ordinary people live, providing a stronger social safety net for people who are in poverty, increasing the standard of living, guaranteeing benefits. It's really trying to realize Franklin Roosevelt's vision as embodied in the Economic Bill of Right from 1944. Is it really possible to accomplish that, in addition to accomplishing the environmental reforms necessitated by climate change?

Well, first of all, let me just back off a little bit on your last comment. I don't think what we're proposing to address climate change is radical. I think what's really radical is the Republican notion that climate change is a hoax, that it shouldn't be addressed, and that they are conveniently ignorant about the science and the facts. That, to me, is an extraordinarily radical proposition, and it may even be a worse than radical proposition once we understand the extent of fossil-fuel funding in the Republican Party.

I'm not going to accept being painted into the radical corner when we try to solve this problem, when I think the radical action here is the way that the Republican Party is misbehaving.

For what it's worth, I don't perceive fighting climate change as being a radical solution. But I believe it's important to try to, one might say, play devil's advocate in terms of acknowledging the arguments that will inevitably be made …

The socialized medicine argument about Medicare. We've seen this game before. We usually power our way through it. To the first part of your question, I would say that the Green New Deal has been expressed in an array of policy recommendations that have an extraordinarily worthy purpose, which is to offset the increasing income inequality in the country, and the increasing share of the country's political power and economic power which is controlled by a smaller and smaller number of extraordinarily wealthy people and families and corporations.

All of that, I think, makes a lot sense. Even Franklin Roosevelt didn't get his New Deal passed in one bill. It was more a statement of purpose. What we have to do, the same way Franklin Roosevelt had to do it, is work together with Congress to pass section-by-section laws that will solve the climate problem before it gets out of hand. After doing that, rebalance what the traditional balance of power has been in American politics and in the American economy. Arrest and reverse the slide in both of those areas of power and money to those that already have the most of it.

There's a reason the Tea Party were serious, and that voters supported Trump, and that voters came out to support Bernie [Sanders] and other authentic — recent in Trump's case — authentic, new and disruptive points of view. That’s because, I think people in America can see and feel and breathe that something is amiss in this country, but they don't have power in Congress any longer. They don't have a fair share of the country's wealth and revenues any longer, and those things are demonstrable and factual.

They're absolutely right to be furious about it, and we need to address that concern. To some extent, the way forward on the climate problem helps address that concern. That’s a very significant plus, not just for liberal politics, and certainly not for ""socialism,"" but for the way America has always worked. It's just -- we're in a Gilded Age.

I'm actually writing my dissertation about The Gilded Age.

Reid, who has repeatedly slammed the president, renewed hostilities and even managed to spin his dislike of Trump into some unexpected praise for a former political adversary.

“In hindsight, I wish every day for a George Bush again,” Reid told CNN’s Dana Bash.

""There's no question in my mind that George Bush would be Babe Ruth in this league that he's in with Donald Trump in the league. Donald Trump wouldn't make the team,"" Reid said.

Reid famously sparred with President Bush during his administration calling him a “loser” and a “liar”, making his admission even more cutting toward the current President.

Reid, who is fighting pancreatic cancer and left office in 2017, was asked by Bash if ‘there was anything he thought the President was doing right?’

“I just have trouble accepting him as a person,” Reid replied. “So frankly, I don’t see anything he is doing right.”

“Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!” Trump tweeted.

Republicans are gearing up for an uncertain and potentially crowded primary in the new election for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, while Democrat Dan McCready is already coalescing support from his party for the re-vote.

As McCready held an event relaunching his campaign Friday and landed a valuable endorsement from the Daily Kos, a small-dollar fundraising powerhouse on the left, a pack of Republicans were considering their own runs, with no clear favorite among them. It’s unclear if Mark Harris — the 2018 candidate whose campaign was the subject of fraud allegations that tainted the midterm election and forced a new race — will run again, after recently suffering from health problems.

Story Continued Below

What’s more, Republicans on the ground think that Harris would now be a weak general election contender in the GOP-leaning district, after North Carolina’s board of elections voted unanimously to call a new campaign. Harris’ son delivered stunning testimony before the board this week, saying he warned his father against hiring the political operative who allegedly collected and marked voters’ absentee ballots in 2018. And Harris, a former preacher, could have trouble raising new money into his broke campaign as a result.

“What we’re going to get is a primary with a lot of candidates,” said Carter Wrenn, a North Carolina Republican strategist. “I wouldn’t presume to tell Harris what to do, but he took a hard hit at the end of the hearings, he’s got some bruises.”

“His whole campaign becomes more problematic,” Wrenn added.

But if Harris does decide to run again, his name recognition — and the belief of some Republican voters that he “got a raw deal” — could make him difficult to beat in a GOP primary, said Patrick Sebastian, a Republican strategist and nephew of former Gov. Pat McCrory. That could be a problem for Republicans in the general election, in a district President Donald Trump carried in 2016, but McCready — a veteran making his first run for office — made competitive in 2018.

It would take someone with “a heck of a lot of money to defeat [Harris] in the primary,” Sebastian said.

North Carolina's board of elections will vote soon to set dates for the new election. Other potential GOP candidates include Matthew Ridenhour, former Mecklenburg County commissioner, and Kenny Smith, a former Charlotte city council member who ran for the mayor of Charlotte and lost. Additionally, former state Rep. Andy Dulin told WSOCTV he would not rule out a run. The state GOP won’t weigh in on the primary but said it will continue to work with legislators and investigators to improve the electoral system.

Though McCrory previously said he’s not interested in running for the congressional seat, local Republicans are pushing him to jump into the primary, according to a person familiar with those discussions. McCrory has also received a few calls from Republicans in Washington, D.C.

McCrory wouldn’t comment on the new election, instead expressing frustration that the election board didn’t continue hearing testimony on Thursday. “Why are they stopping the investigation — both Republicans and Democrats,” McCrory said.

Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman told a local CBS affiliate that “a criminal prosecution should be anticipated” on the allegations of election fraud against Dowless. Freeman added that her office is not only trying to get to the bottom of any illegal activity that took place but “who might have been funding that and what did they know?”

As Republicans wait to figure out who might run in the 9th District, McCready rallied supporters Friday.

“I am running in the special election for North Carolina’s 9th district,” McCready said at an event. “We are in this fight and we are going to win this fight. ... This is about what does it mean to live in a democracy.”

McCready starts the new election with a major financial head start. The Democrat raised about $500,000 in December and ended 2018 with approximately $337,000 in his campaign account. Harris finished 2018 with just $19,131 on hand. Meanwhile, McCready sent campaign emails and launched a barrage of digital fundraising ads Thursday and Friday after the new election was called.

He also has support from Democratic heavy-hitters from the Daily Kos to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is ready to back up McCready in the new race.

“Dan McCready is a United States Marine Corps veteran who led a platoon in Iraq, as well as a business leader who has created jobs in his community in North Carolina,” said Cole Leiter, DCCC spokesperson. “While Washington Republicans have spent over $2 million propping up a candidate who stole North Carolinians’ votes and threatened the integrity of our election process, we’re proud to stand with Dan and look forward to him bringing his leadership to Congress.”

The DCCC plans to hammer the North Carolina GOP and national Republicans over the election fraud allegations — particularly what Harris knew and when. After taking a break in the middle of Thursday’s election board hearing to huddle with his lawyers, Harris returned to the stand to admit that he’d been mistaken in early testimony about whether he expected email exchanges with one of his sons to be made public.

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which does not get involved in open GOP primaries, has not said what it will do in the new election. NRCC chair Tom Emmer issued a statement against ballot harvesting — the process of collecting others’ absentee ballots to turn them in, which is illegal in North Carolina but legal in other states.

""Voter fraud is never acceptable and neither is ballot harvesting. We call on Democrats to join Republicans in rejecting the practice of ballot harvesting in every congressional district in the country,” Emmer said in the statement.

After remaining quiet about the scandal, Trump weighed in Friday.

Radical ideas are not unusual in the early stages of a US presidential election campaign, but many of the Democratic candidates for 2020 are advocating unrealistic policies. Just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an established, more practical one.

CAMBRIDGE – America’s Democratic Party is moving to the left, we are told. It is not yet clear whether this applies to the median American voter, or the median member of Congress who was elected last November. But it is clear that many of the candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are experimenting with “bold new ideas.” They seem to receive a disproportionate amount of attention for doing so. If interpreted literally, many of these policy proposals are not entirely practical, either economically or politically.

Renewing Europe Mar 4, 2019 calls on EU citizens to focus on three goals ahead of the critical European Parliament election in May. Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images A Better Populism Feb 27, 2019 argues that beggar-thy-neighbor policies cannot solve the problems facing declining communities. Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Fortunately, few of the current or prospective Democratic candidates have yet committed irrevocably to extreme policies. Any of them could still build a campaign on solid practical proposals to address inequality and other pressing problems, without sacrificing economic growth or fiscal sustainability.

Such ideas are perhaps most likely to come from moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, former US Representative Beto O’Rourke, or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Other prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, share this emphasis on the doable. They made important progress with practical policies in areas such as health insurance, financial regulation, and progressive taxation, although Republicans often blocked or reversed these advances.

There is no reason why other new faces in the presidential field, such as US Senator Amy Klobuchar, cannot follow in the sensible Democratic tradition of Obama and Pelosi. The same applies to fellow senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, who are often seen as being on the left of the party.

But for now, the bolder, less practical Democratic ideas are getting the airtime. Five in particular stand out, and there exist more practical alternatives to each of them.

First is the proposal for a marginal income-tax rate of 70% on the super-rich. There are more efficient and enforceable ways to improve income distribution in the US. For starters, the carried-interest loophole could be abolished, the Earned Income Tax Credit could be expanded, and the payroll tax could be made more progressive. Further suggestions include restoring the inheritance tax on all estates worth more than, say, $10 million, and eliminating the “step-up” of estates’ valuation that allows generations to pass on capital gains without ever paying tax on them. Other substantial Republican tax cuts for the rich could be reversed, too.

Another idea is that the government pays for universal four-year college education. But this would be expensive, and not the best way to help the children of families that have been left behind by US economic growth. Universal, quality pre-school might be a more effective way of working toward equality of educational opportunity.

To be sure, it makes sense to expand student grants for higher education and increase support for public institutions. This should cover two-year programs and vocational training as well as four-year degrees. But the most urgent higher-education policy priority is pushing back against the scams perpetrated by some for-profit colleges. The worst of these leave vulnerable students – veterans have been frequent targets – with high taxpayer-funded debts, low graduation rates, and poor post-graduation employment prospects.

A third idea is universal health-care coverage through “Medicare for All.” If this meant adding a public option for those who can’t get private health insurance, it would be a worthy initiative. But US Senator Bernie Sanders – not a Democrat, but running for the party’s nomination – has been clear that he favors the elimination of private health insurance. Most Americans do not respond positively when they realize that “Medicare for All” would force the many who are currently happy with their employer-paid plans to give them up, and saddle taxpayers with an enormous fiscal burden.

A more practical Democratic health-care policy would be to resume the expansion of coverage rates that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) achieved. This means, as a first step, reversing the damage that Republicans have done to it.

Fourth, several candidates support a government-led “Green New Deal” that would radically change US energy use. True, when the US unemployment rate exceeded 8% between 2009 and 2012, the country could have used a larger and longer increase in government spending on environmental projects than Obama was able to get past Congress. But, with unemployment currently around 4%, now is not a good time to be expanding the budget deficit.

If the Green New Deal were interpreted as simply a rallying cry to mobilize support for strong action on climate change, it would be a welcome development. But the impracticality of so many of the Green New Deal’s components is worrisome, such as its goal of expanding renewable energy to 100% of electric power, not to mention some of the package’s extraneous parts. The efficient way to achieve climate-change goals is not via a truly massive expansion of government, but rather by using the price mechanism, meaning either a carbon tax or tradable emission permits.

Finally, Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (who is not seeking the presidency) recently proposed preventing firms from buying back their shares. It is true that corporations have spent more of their big gains from the December 2017 tax cut on share buybacks and dividends than on investment or workers. But the proper remedy is to broaden the corporate tax base. Banning buybacks would just divert firms’ extra profits into Treasury bills or other companies’ shares.

Radical proposals are not unusual in the early stages of a presidential election campaign. But just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an older, more practical one. The Democratic contenders for 2020 would be wise to remember this as they chase their presidential dreams.",Should Bold Ideas Drown Out Old Ideas?,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/presidential-election-2020-democrats-radical-proposals-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-02

Elizabeth Warren highlighted her new universal child care plan and explained her support for reparations for black Americans affected by slavery as she campaigned Friday night in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.

Taking questions from reporters after headlining the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club fundraising gala, Warren pointed to the country’s “ugly history of racism” as she explained her support for the proposal.

HARRIS, WARREN, EMBRACE REPARATIONS

“We need to confront it head-on and we need to talk about the right away to address it and make change,” Warren added.

The idea of reparations for black Americans affected by slavery is also backed by at least two other Democratic presidential candidates – Sen. Kamala Harris of California and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as housing secretary under President Barack Obama.

The push by some Democratic White House hopefuls points to the further importance of race and identity issues within the party. While supporters say reparations are needed to address slavery and other racist aspects of American history, some critics say such a move could cost several trillion dollars.

Asked whether she would include Native Americans in her support for reparations, Warren answered “I think it’s a part of the conversation. It’s an important part of the conversation.”

The senator has long faced criticism over her claims of Native American heritage, and recently apologized to the Cherokee Nation for last autumn’s release of DNA results in a bid to prove she had Native American ancestry dating back at least six generations.

WARREN HECKLED ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL

Child care, early education

Warren used her much of her address to more than 900 Democratic officials, federal, state and local lawmakers, rainmakers, and party activists in New Hampshire to showcase her new universal child care and early education proposal.

“We’re the richest country in the history of the planet. Access to high-quality care and education during the first five years of a child’s life shouldn’t be a privilege reserved for the rich,” she said to a standing ovation, one of around 10 that she received during her address.

Warren emphasized that “high-quality child care should be a right for every child in America.”

The senator touted that her plan “would provide high-quality care and education for free for millions of families and at low cost for everyone else.”

Warren claimed that she could pay for her plan “without raising taxes one thin dime for working families.”

She said revenues from the ultra-millioanires tax that she recently proposed would “cover the cost of this universal child care and early education plan.”

ELIZABETH WARREN CALLS FOR 'WEALTH TAX' ON RICHEST AMERICANS

“Asking the 75,000 wealthiest families in this country to pay a little more would cover the cost of providing affordable and high-quality child care and early education options to every child in our country,” she added.

Republicans respond

The Republican National Committee targeted Warren's proposal.

“Whether it’s government-run health care, taxpayer-funded jobs for all, or universal daycare, nothing is free and ultimately these proposals do nothing but raise taxes and expand big government. The financial burden always falls on the taxpayer,” RNC spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said.

""Ultimately these proposals do nothing but raise taxes and expand big government."" — Mandi Merritt, spokeswoman, Republican National Committee

But that kind of criticism doesn't fly with Manchester, N.H., Bergen Ambrose, who said as she waited in line after the speech to take a selfie with the senator that “I’m sold on Elizabeth Warren.”

Ambrose, who recently moved to the state from Massachusetts, said the controversy over Warren’s claims of Native American heritage didn’t trouble her.

“That is nothing in comparison to the scandals that we’ve seen on the Republican side” she explained. “I feel like she is the voice of the people.”

But Granite State native and Derry, N.H., resident Alyssa Wadlin is undecided at this early point in the campaign.

“I’m definitely excited about Elizabeth Warren. I’m excited about Kamala Harris, too. Those are my two front-runners,” she explained. “Elizabeth answered a lot of things that I wanted to hear from her tonight.”

Wadlin said beating President Trump in the general election was the most important factor in her decision.

“I wanted to see tonight that we have a candidate that can speak to all of America. It’s easy to be a Democrat from Massachusetts. I wanted to see that a Democrat from Massachusetts can speak to the rest of the country,” she said.

Friday night’s speech kicked off a two-day swing by Warren through the Granite State. It’s her fourth visit to New Hampshire since launching her campaign Dec. 31. Many political observers consider New Hampshire a ""must win"" state for a presidential candidate from neighboring Massachusetts. Bay State White House contenders have a long history of winning the first-in-the-nation primary. Think most recently of Democratic Sen. John Kerry in 2004 and former Republican Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012.

But the state is also a ""must win"" for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont. On Tuesday, the independent senator and fellow populist firebrand launched his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The night before Warren returned to New Hampshire, Sanders held a conference call with many of his top Granite State supporters from his 2016 campaign.

A top Sanders supporter and adviser who was on the call told Fox News that the senator told them that “New Hampshire’s extremely important and he made that point very clearly, how important it is for all of us to work as hard if not harder than we did last time and win again.”

Trump to delay tariff hikes against China

President Donald Trump announced Sunday on Twitter that he would be delaying an increase in tariffs against China and plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to settle on a final trade agreement. Trump said ongoing trade negotiations with China have been ""very productive"" and that he would delay the tariffs. Those were set to go into effect March 1, ahead of a meeting with President Xi at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. Trump said last week that he expected to meet soon with Xi to work out “the final points” of an agreement. Currency manipulation is one of a number of issues that have been on the table as part of the ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries.

Fire bombs on Venezuela border as opposition tries to deliver aid

Tear gas, rubber bullets and fire bombs from Venezuela’s National Guard rained down on activists on the Colombia-Venezuela border Saturday as the opposition tried to deliver humanitarian aid. The guard set fire to trucks in Cucuta carrying materials destined for the country’s starving people, and along the Brazil border two protesters were killed. Amid the aid push, President Nicolas Maduro broke diplomatic relations with Colombia, whose government he accuses of aiding a U.S.-led effort to oust him from power. Opposition leader Juan Guaido said he would meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence Monday in Colombia at an emergency meeting of mostly conservative Latin American governments to discuss Venezuela’s crisis.

Pope on clergy abuse: 'Spare no effort' to bring justice

Pope Francis vowed to ""spare no effort"" in confronting the Catholic Church’s clergy sex abuse scandal head-on, calling Sunday for priests to be guided by the ""holy fear of God"" while victims are believed and supported. His comments were to a group of about 190 Catholic bishops and religious superiors summoned to Rome. Last week, Francis defrocked former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, after Vatican officials found him guilty of sex crimes against minors and adults. McCarrick is the most senior Catholic official to be defrocked for such crimes, and church experts say that's a reflection of how slowly the church has moved in response to the scandal.

Amazon Prime cargo plane crashes

Authorities said they had recovered a body as they hunted for clues Sunday into an Amazon Prime Air cargo plane crash outside Houston. The Boeing 767 operated by Atlas Air was a scheduled cargo flight for Amazon from Miami to Houston when it disappeared from radar Saturday and apparently nosedived into a swampy area about 30 miles from George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Three people were aboard the plane, and police said it was unlikely anyone survived. Federal investigators are helping local authorities search the wreckage for the plane's boxes, which could help explain the crash.

Sex spas are big business, authorities say after Robert Kraft charges

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution, police in Florida said Friday. Police said Kraft paid for sexual services at a Jupiter, Florida, spa under investigation for ties to an international human trafficking ring. While the charges have brought national attention to the issue of sex trafficking, data, expert opinion and cases from around the USA show how widespread the problem is. Illicit massage or spa businesses, similar to the ones in the Florida case, were the top location or industry where sex trafficking occurred in 2017, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. “The spas will make $20,000, $30,000 a year total, and yet they’re pulling in hundreds of thousands of dollars that we know of,” sheriff’s Lt. Mike Dougherty of Florida's Martin County said Friday.

Biden has yet to declare his presidential intentions, but if he does run, he’s looking at a Trump-like coalition of support within the Democratic Party, with backing from men, the less-educated and older voters.

Mr. Biden would enter the race as the most well-known and most well-liked option, with polls consistently putting the 76-year-old first in the Democratic nomination race.

“There is no question he is the front-runner if he decides to announce,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth Polling Institute, told The Washington Times.

The Biden buzz picked up last week after Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said she believed her old friend was going to make a third bid for the White House.

Ms. Feinstein confessed that she likely would catch flak for backing him over the female candidates in the field, signaling just how divided Democratic voters are on their potential options.

Democratic strategists say that could complicate things for Mr. Biden, a white man in his 70s, at a time when many in the party want to nominate someone who checks other boxes such as being younger, female or a racial or ethnic minority.

Everyone loves Mr. Biden, but his window for a successful presidential bid may have closed, they say.

The polls so far suggest that’s not a major hurdle.

The latest Monmouth Polling Institute national survey showed him holding a double-digit lead over the pack of contenders. Self-described moderates, the 50-plus crowd, white voters without a college degree, and men are his most fervent supporters.

That’s a serious deviation from the liberal multiracial coalition that powered President Barack Obama — and Mr. Biden, on the same ticket — to victories in 2008 and 2012, then boosted Democrats to a majority in the House in November’s elections.

“Older, white men, working class, ex-union guys still make up a significant, but smaller portion of the Democratic Party, and for the Democratic Party to be a majority party they have to hold this coalition together even as younger voters, and minority voters grow in strength,” Mr. Murray said.”There is no question Joe Biden has a particular appeal to that group of old, labor Democrats.”

Other past candidates have held early national polling leads, only to take a pass at running or to see their campaigns fizzle. Then-Sen. Joe Lieberman was Democrats’ front-runner in 2003, but he failed to win any primaries or caucuses in 2004. Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was the Republican front-runner in 2007 but failed to win any of the early 2008 states.

Mr. Biden may buck that trend, with polls showing his national support is matched by strong backing in the early primary states.

A UMass Poll released Thursday put the former vice president outpacing the field in New Hampshire, for example.

“With a roster full of fresh, young faces vying to be the Democratic Party’s nominee, New Hampshire’s Democratic primary voters seem more comfortable handing the reins to a seasoned veteran,” said Tatishe Nteta, associate professor of political science and director of the poll.

The deep reservoir of goodwill for Mr. Biden derives in large part from the eight years he spent as Mr. Obama’s sidekick. He also remains a sympathetic figure, having lost his first wife and 1-year-old daughter in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.

Being liked, though, is different than being trusted on the issues, activists say.

He led action on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act and voted for the Iraq War in 2002 and a bankruptcy reform bill in 2005 — each of them now viewed by liberal activists as a colossal mistake.

Bryce Smith, chairman of the Dallas County Iowa Democrats, said Mr. Biden will have to defend more than four decades of public service that started before four of the declared Democratic candidates were even born.

“Joe Biden has sat at the presidential table,” Mr. Smith said. “He understands that you have an agenda and you have goals and you have ideas, but in all reality you kind of have to be the pragmatic negotiator to get moving towards those goals and ideas, which I think is not a strong point for him in a Democratic primary — especially in this Democratic primary where we see a tremendous amount of pressure to move the party to the left.”

Dionne: History will notice which Republicans distance themselves from Trump Salt Lake Tribune California Republican Party elects first woman, Latina to be its leader Los Angeles Times California's hurting Republicans pick insider to lead party ABC News …","Washington • In 1964, Nelson Rockefeller, then the governor of New York, rose before the Republican National Convention to condemn “extremists” who had “no plan and no program to keep the peace and bring freedom to the world.”

Amidst the boos and catcalls from right-wingers on the floor, Rockefeller denounced those who ""spread distrust,"" ""engender suspicion"" and ""encourage disunity.""

“There is no place in this Republican Party,” declared this stalwart of GOP progressivism, “for such hawkers of hate, such purveyors of prejudice, such fabricators of fear.”

You wonder what Rocky would make of a President Trump and the movement he has nurtured. And you sure wish someone like Rockefeller were around today to call his party back to reason and tolerance.

The events of recent days ought to try the consciences of Republicans who know that extremism and hatred are wrong. Many in the party acknowledge — usually in private — that the president they have continued to back has rooted his political appeal in vicious attacks against his opponents and a free press. He has invented crises for the purpose of stoking dread and horror. And he targeted minority groups (immigrants especially) to harvest political support.

In the meantime, the party as a whole has abandoned the embrace of civil rights and voting rights that had been, from the Lincoln era to Rockefeller's time, the GOP's calling card. Mimicking the segregationist Democrats of the past, Republicans have of late used the unfounded specter of voter fraud to justify voter ID laws and other measures squarely aimed at impeding access to the ballot box by African-Americans and the young.

So there was a delicious irony to last week's unanimous ruling by the North Carolina Board of Elections that it was a Republican candidate for Congress, Mark Harris, who found himself accused of massive voter fraud. As a result, the board threw out the district's 2018 election results and called a new election.

In 2017 Trump named a presidential commission that scoured the country for instances of in-person voter fraud that might justify the party's voter suppression efforts. It was such a bust that the commission itself had to be disbanded just eight months later.

Impeding voting rights needs to be called what it is: an act of extremism. It is radically anti-democratic to keep your opponents from voting. Where are the Republicans who will speak out loudly and clearly against what their party has done in so many states that they controlled?

An even more startling development was news that police in Maryland had arrested Christopher P. Hasson, a lieutenant in the Coast Guard and a self-identified white nationalist. The authorities said he stockpiled weapons and drew up a list of liberal politicians and commentators whom he hoped to kill. His catalog of targets included, among others, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (whom he called ""Sen blumen jew""), and MSNBC commentators Joe Scarborough, Ari Melber and Chris Hayes.

Even if many Republicans have no problem these days labeling nearly all Democrats ""socialists"" based on the self-descriptions of a few in the party's ranks, it's obvious that no one should call out the entire GOP for the plotting of a fanatical would-be assassin.

One can, however, ask all responsible Republicans to deplore right-wing fanaticism and to take the threat of homegrown white nationalist terrorism as seriously as they do terrorism inspired from abroad. It is entirely fair to imagine that the GOP (and, especially, the president) would have a lot more to say if Hasson had been, say, a Muslim.

And it is important to examine the public statements of the president himself, his efforts to divide the country, and his constant demonizing of all those who oppose him.

Let's go back to Rockefeller's words: Day after day, Trump truly is a hawker of hate, a purveyor of prejudice, and a fabricator of fear. Prejudice and fear are at the heart of his invocation of national emergency powers to build his wall, an abuse of authority that ought to horrify all who proudly call themselves ""constitutional conservatives.""

The good news is that Republicans will soon have an opportunity to tell us who they are. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called a vote this week on a measure rejecting Trump's emergency declaration. The House is virtually certain to pass it. The Senate, by law, will be required to take it up.

It's not too much to say that history will notice how many Republicans choose to separate themselves from Trump's extremism.

211,Empty,2019-02-24T13:31:06Z,"The Huduma number, a new Kenyan government initiative, is yet another assault on data privacy in Kenya.","One of the most surreal moments of the August 2017 Supreme Court hearing on Kenya's presidential election, an event that would culminate in the unprecedented rejection of the results announced by the electoral commission, happened on its first day.

Lawyers for the opposition demanded that the servers containing data for the 19.2 million registered voters in Kenya be opened and checked for electoral fraud. Lawyers for the electoral commission insisted that it could not be done because the servers were in France.

Millions of Kenyan citizens' biometric data was collected over an extended period of time in preparation for the highly contested 2017 vote. However, when the data was most needed, at the point when it was necessary to verify the results announced by the electoral commission, it was unavailable. Apparently, a private foreign entity, a French firm known as OT Safran Morpho, owned the information and the government struggled to get the corporation in question to make the information available on demand.

In February 2019, Kenya is gearing up to launch another massive citizen data collection drive called ""the Huduma Number"". Over a 30-day period, the government will compel citizens in a number of counties to register their biometric details, other identity numbers and their physical address to receive a new number to be used as ""a unique identifier"".

Further digging reveals the government has done a deal with MasterCard to link the Huduma number to a prepaid card with chip and pin that will be used by citizens to pay for an array of government services.The government denies that the two initiatives are connected, but given similar initiatives in countries like Nigeria, there is credible fear that the initiatives will eventually be combined. Regardless, the Huduma programme will add yet another number and card to the litany of numbers and cards that Kenyans must wield to prove their Kenyan citizenship to their increasingly predatory state.

The Huduma card will join your ID, passport, driver's licence, birth certificate, National Social Security Fund card, National Hospital Insurance Fund card, Kenya Revenue Authority Tax PIN, etc.

Critically, the invitation to apply comes with a threat: Anyone who does not register will be denied government services.

There are many wrong and, indeed, dangerous elements to this initiative.

For one, forcing citizens to sign up for a financial product under the threat of denying them important government services isn't governance, it is blackmail. Kenya's constitution provides that all legislation must be subjected to public participation.

Therefore, it is prima facie unconstitutional for a government ministry to make a ""roadside declaration"": to create a new legislative hurdle for gaining an important citizenship document without allowing the public time to reflect and respond.

Yet, this ill-informed initiative was announced at a press conference and information about it was distributed on both traditional and social media: a roadside declaration with 21st-century tools.

Secondly, Kenya still does not have a data protection law. That means that this massive data collection exercise - including facial recognition, fingerprints and other key citizen data - will be in place in the absence of any real legal oversight.

Remember the surrealism of Kenya's electoral servers, still owned by OT Safran Morpho, and apparently inaccessible from Kenya without interlocution by the French? There are currently no legal provisions, certainly none in the public domain, that prevent OT Morpho Safran from monetising data that Kenyans provided to enhance their democratic processes.

In my book, Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics, I call this ""digital colonialism"" - where a private corporation in one country is given political power over citizens of a second country for its own economic benefit.

The fact that Kenya's election database could not be made available on demand for what was arguably the most important legal process in the country's history is cause for major concern. Kenyan electoral data is now a product for digestion and monetisation in a legal domain beyond our control.

How free can a country be when citizen information that is central to government and governance is nothing more than a commercial product owned by a foreign corporation?

Significantly, the Kenyan government has not demonstrated that it can be trusted with Kenyans personal data.

A report from Tactical Tech reveals the extent of abuse that occurred during the 2017 presidential election in the absence of a rigorous data protection law. Voter registers were available for sale and were publicly available through SMS and web, which allowed politicians to send unsolicited text messages and even make calls to voters.

Party lists collected by the various political parties also contained key private data and were not secured in any meaningful way.

Outside the election, Privacy International has also reported on how mobile data from Kenyans is routinely handed over to the police and other security actors to facilitate other forms of human rights abuse, like extrajudicial executions or arbitrary arrest and detention.

Kenyans also routinely complain of their private mobile data being sold to third-party service providers without their consent. They often receive a barrage of unsolicited text messages and have to pay to unsubscribe from such premium services.

Women have also complained of being harassed by security guards to whom they must provide key contact details before accessing any public or private buildings.

As it stands, if you are Kenyan, your data is not secure or safe, especially not from a government that has routinely avoided creating a legal framework to at least give citizens some form of recourse when violations happen. This Huduma number is an ill-timed, ill-advised initiative that should be suspended until further public participation and consultation occur.

Jay Inslee warned Republicans on Sunday that the Democratic Party will govern by the standard set by President Trump’s emergency declaration for border security, especially on the issue of climate change, if the GOP majority in the Senate don't fight it.

Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Feb. 15, after Congress refused to give him the funding he had requested to build a border wall. Sixteen states, not including Washington, filed a lawsuit last week against the Trump administration over the order that would divert billions of dollars from the military for the project.

House Democrats have set a Tuesday vote to advance a resolution to reject Trump’s declaration. The measure is expected to easily pass in the Democratic-controlled House. In the Senate, Democrats need four Republicans to defect to put it on Trump’s desk. Trump said Friday he would “100 percent” veto the measure.

“Republicans ought to stand up on their hind legs, because they took an oath to the Constitution, not to Donald Trump, and reverse this decision,” Inslee, a Democrat, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“But if there are new rules, the Republicans have to understand that Democrats will play by whatever the rules are, particularly when it comes to climate change,” he said.

Inslee, who has teased a possible 2020 campaign, also said during the interview that he could announce his decision as soon as this week.

“People want a president that will act on a real emergency, which is climate change,” he said. “[Americans] need a president who will rally the nation to a clean energy economy, jobs by the millions, and save this country from that damage.”",Gov.

""In terms of the constituencies that we are looking at, it's no different from the ones we contested in 2015 - subject of course to the redrawing of the boundaries which we won't know until closer to the election,"" Dr Chee told reporters at a Mandarin Orchard ballroom.

""But as it stands right now, it will be those same few constituencies that we contested in 2015.""

SDP had fielded 11 candidates in the 2015 General Election but failed to gain a seat. The party contested three Single Member Constituencies – Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang and Yuhua - and two Group Representation Constituencies – Holland-Bukit Timah and Marsiling-Yew Tee.

The next general election must be held by April 2021.

The SDP’s new campaign slogan is “#SDPNOW, The Way Forward”, which Dr Chee said was based on the party’s ""vision"" and ""alternative policies"" for the future.

He added that the SDP has stuck to its beliefs and values.

""We're still continuing to fight the same things, because the PAP (People’s Action Party) refuses to change,"" he said.

""And in the interim, what they have done is that they have hit us, thrown the kitchen sink at us, but we've stuck to our message, we've never wavered in our belief that rights come before riches, people before profit, wisdom before wealth.""

He also explained why the SDP is kickstarting its campaign early.

""The fight, the contest, is won or lost way before those nine days (of campaigning). So for us, it's making sure we start early, we get people who are new here, coming to this event early enough ... Call us kiasu, I don't know, but it's important for us because we don't know when elections are going to be held. By the time it's held, it's going to be too late,” Dr Chee said.

Several SDP members took to the stage at the launch, including chairman Paul Tambyah and vice chairman John Tan.

Dr Tambyah talked about the “relentless rise in the cost of living”, as well as a “series of leaks and tragedies” that he said have caused people to question whether the PAP is up to the task of leading Singapore.

“I don’t think mistakes are going to go away,” he added. “I know they will happen, that malicious individuals will commit crimes that hurt many people and accidents also will happen, but what I’m concerned about is that nobody takes responsibility, or ownership of these disasters.""



A “CONSOLIDATED” OPPOSITION NEEDED: DR CHEE

In his speech, Dr Chee touched on the importance of having a “consolidated” opposition effort in local politics.

The SDP was among seven opposition parties which came together last year to explore the possibility of working closer together at the next general election.

Present at that meeting was political veteran Tan Cheng Bock, who recently filed an application to form a new political party called Progress Singapore Party.

“The first step is to get everybody to sit at the same table and ask the question - what are we trying to achieve?” Dr Chee said on Saturday. “I want to encourage our opposition friends to think of what we are fighting for and work towards that end where we have that common value, that goal we want to achieve.”

SDP chairman Paul Tambyah addresses the audience during his party’s campaign launch on Feb 23, 2019. (Photo: Matthew Mohan)

Mr Benjamin Pwee, who recently applied to join SDP after his resignation from the Democratic Progressive Party, was at the campaign launch.

“The launch was very good because it features public policy which is at the very heart and it is very much beliefs and values based rather than personality based,” Mr Pwee told Channel NewsAsia. “There are very few political parties who have the wherewithal to actually come up with good solid policy formulations.”

The SDP’s Central Executive Committee will meet in early March to consider the application of Mr Pwee, who contested in Bishan-Toa Payoh in the last two general elections.

According to SDP vice chairman John Tan, the party will progressively roll out a series of revised policies in the months to come, with their cost of living policy and housing policy to be unveiled in March.

The party is also planning to hold a pre-election rally at Hong Lim Park in September.","SDP launches election campaign, aims to contest same constituencies as in GE2015",Channelnewsasia.com,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sdp-launches-campaign-general-election-constituencies-11282880

On Saturday night, Harris was on the other side of town at the United Steelworkers hall, keynoting the Iowa Democratic Party Black Caucus. Klobuchar, as she always does, built her speech up to a quote from Walter Mondale, talking about Jimmy Carter’s presidency: “We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.” Harris, as is her custom, progressed to a paraphrase of Coretta Scott King: “The fight for justice and the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation.”

Afterward, I asked Klobuchar what she thought being a senator from Minnesota, compared with being a senator from California, would mean to Iowa.

“It means that for me, going south for the winter is going to Iowa. It’s easier to get here,” she said. “It’s important to have a lot of people running, but I am a candidate from the heartland, and it’s an important part of our path to success in the general election.”

Graeme Wood: The two Amy Klobuchars

Was she arguing that senators from the coasts—not just Harris, but Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kirsten Gillibrand—wouldn’t be able to win?

“Senators from the coast have won in the heartland in the past. So I don’t think it’s that. It’s that my No. 1 request was to be on the Agriculture Committee. I served on that committee for 12 years. I’ve played a major role in getting the farm bill passed,” she said. “I know these issues here.”

Klobuchar likes talking about herself as an underdog, and structurally that’s how she started a campaign that many people thought she wasn’t actually going to go through with. She’s short on campaign staff, here and nationally, and arrived with just one person on her payroll and a handful of others who’d come in as volunteers. She had a surge of online fundraising after she announced, but aides have acknowledged in conversations with others that money is going to be a scramble and that her best hope is to scrape by enough to make it through Iowa, and then count on an explosion of interest if she wins to carry her over.

And so she lays it on thick, talking about the two states’ main agricultural exports, or how they both put a premium on butter-carving contests. On the list of ways the states are similar that she read from on Thursday evening: “You have the world-famous matchstick museum, and we have the only museum in the world devoted to Spam—or, as we call it, the ‘Guggen-ham.’”

But her main argument is that the country needs a pragmatic president, and that starts with making a pragmatic argument for why she should be the nominee.

“We need to win. So here’s my deal: I have won every single congressional district in the state of Minnesota, including Michele Bachmann’s, three times,” Klobuchar said, referring to the former congresswoman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate who helped popularize Tea Party politics in the run-up to a campaign that got much more attention than actual votes. With Democrats nationally nervous that Minnesota is in danger of slipping away—in a shocker, it had the smallest margin of any state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and Trump’s campaign has been public about Minnesota being at the top of its 2020 target list—Klobuchar leaned in.",The Opposite Reasons Klobuchar and Harris Both Need Iowa,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/klobuchar-harris-need-win-iowa-caucuses-2020/583558/

The outcome of Sunday’s contest sets the stage for coalition talks or possibly new elections, just as the country has recovered from a political and economic crisis following a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

Adding to the uncertainty, opposition leaders threatened street protests after raising suspicions of vote-buying.

The opposition Socialists, who favor closer ties to Moscow, emerged as the largest party with 35 out of 101 seats on a revised estimate, with recounts possible in some constituencies.

The ruling Democratic Party, which wants closer integration with the EU, came second with 30 seats while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight corruption, was third with 26 seats.

Democratic leader Vladimir Plahotniuc said his party was “ready for negotiations on forming a majority and approving a new government”, adding, “I hope that such negotiations take place as soon as possible”.

Corruption scandals and worries over the health of democracy in Moldova, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member Romania and is one of Europe’s poorest countries, have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The Socialist Party said its lawyers were studying reported election violations and declared it may not recognize the results.

ACUM leader Maia Sandu said her bloc did not recognize the elections as free and democratic.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the elections were “generally well-run” but “tainted by allegations of pressure on public employees, strong indications of vote buying and the misuse of state resources”.

President Igor Dodon, formerly head of the Socialist Party, said it would become clear only in the coming weeks whether the election was above board. He raised the prospect of calling a new election in June if the vote was declared illegitimate or no party managed to form a coalition.

Dodon on Saturday had called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”.

Plahotniuc, an oil-to-hotels tycoon, could repeat a feat he achieved at a previous election in 2014, of cobbling together a coalition despite not winning a majority.

He may woo a smaller party led by Ilan Shor, who just two years ago was convicted of fraud and money-laundering for his part in a scam to pilfer $1 billion out of three banks, the equivalent of an eighth of Moldova’s national output in what Moldovans call the “theft of the century”.

Shor denied wrongdoing and said he was made a scapegoat. After time spent under house arrest, he became mayor of the central town of Orhei while his appeal was heard.

His party won 7 seats on Sunday.

POISONED POLITICS

The election campaign was dogged by controversy.

In the past few days, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia announced an investigation into Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organized crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favor by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

The crisis in Venezuela is sending tremors through Florida’s political landscape, emboldening Republicans and throwing Democrats on the defensive in the nation’s largest swing state.

Florida Republicans hope the outspoken push by President Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will help the GOP strengthen its bonds with the state’s Hispanic voters, paying dividends in the 2020 election and beyond.

Opposition to the socialist regime in Caracas, which is closely aligned with communist Cuba, has been a shared cause of the state’s large and traditionally pro-Republican Cuban American and Venezuelan immigrant communities.

“It’s a huge moment for the Republican Party,” said Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist and GOP donor with ties to Trump and Rubio. “It will be like Donald Trump can [be] to Venezuelan American voters the way Ronald Reagan was to Cuban American voters.”

Adding to the tension is growing concern among Democrats that Trump and his allies, seizing on the party’s leftward shift, will move to portray his potential 2020 challengers as socialists and point to Venezuela’s collapse as a symbol of what’s wrong with the views they espouse.

Florida Democrats are disavowing the recent refusal by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist, to label Maduro a dictator and call for him to go, though Sanders has criticized him.

“They are clearly ignorant comments, and someone who’s running for president of the United States should be better briefed and knowledgeable about this crisis in Venezuela and how it impacts the Florida political landscape,” said Christian Ulvert, a Florida Democratic strategist who is of Nicaraguan descent and whose husband’s family has roots in Venezuela.

A Sanders aide said the candidate strongly supports self-determination for Venezuelans, but that to suggest the possibility of military intervention, as Trump has done, is irresponsible.

The emerging dynamic comes at the start of a closely watched two-year stretch for each party in Florida, as both see the state as an important front in the battle for control of the Oval Office. Democrats are hoping to make a comeback after their nominees for the White House, the U.S. Senate and the Florida governorship lost in the last two elections, despite initially appearing to have good odds.

Democrats for years have hoped Florida will move into their orbit, especially with the rise of a new generation of Cuban Americans that is less conservative and less driven by animus toward Cuba’s communist government.

President Barack Obama captured Florida in 2008 and 2012, and Trump’s anti-immigrant posture has alienated many Hispanic voters.

However, the state remains conservative in many ways, particularly its rural stretches and the Florida panhandle, and recent Democratic candidates, including former senator Bill Nelson and gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum, were unable to prevail.

Now it’s Republicans who are hoping they can shift the state more firmly into their camp, powered by the GOP’s anti-Maduro push.

Still, the outcome of Trump’s Venezuela strategy remains to be seen and risks political blowback should the crisis continue to escalate. That could compound widespread concerns in Florida’s Latino communities about Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and hard-line border policies.

Trump traveled to Miami on Feb. 18 to deliver a speech urging Venezuelan military officers to abandon Maduro and pledge support for opposition leader Juan Guaidó. He also forcefully criticized socialism, invoked two countries with large exile communities in South Florida and seemed to draw a direct line between his foreign policy and his domestic political message.

“As the United States stands up for democracy in Venezuela, we reaffirm the solidarity with the long-suffering people of Cuba and Nicaragua and people everywhere living under socialist and communist regimes,” he said. “And to those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country.”

In recent weeks, Trump has intensified his critique of socialism, seeking to portray the Democrats running against him as far-left extremists who have embraced policies he casts as outside the mainstream.

Republicans believe those arguments could be effective, especially in some parts of South Florida, where an older generation of Cuban Americans whose relatives fled the communist regime — or who did so themselves — are deeply skeptical of left-wing governance.

At the moment, Cuban Americans are paying close attention to the situation unfolding in Venezuela, according to a local official, including how the Trump administration responds.

“Many Cubans here predicted what would happen in Venezuela,” said Carlos A. Gimenez, the Cuban-born mayor of Miami-Dade County. Gimenez, a Republican, said he was pleased to see Washington Republicans “putting down socialism” and argued that the administration’s strategy on Venezuela would help the GOP in Florida.

At the forefront of that strategy is Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and a sharp Trump critic when they were rivals in the 2016 presidential race. Since then, the two have cultivated a more positive relationship, rooted heavily in collaborating on foreign policy in Latin America.

Rubio recently traveled to Colombia, visiting an area near the border with Venezuela. The senator also has been tweeting real-time updates about the volatile situation on the ground.

On Saturday, he posted a steady stream of messages, including information about aid trucks and the presence of the Venezuelan National Guard. “Very tense moments as civilians take to the street on #Venezuela side of border & peaceful aid workers have started up the trucks at border crossing,” he said in one tweet.

Among Democrats in Florida, there has been a lot of focus on a recent interview Sanders gave to Univision, a Spanish-language television network.

“Is Nicolás Maduro a dictator, senator, for you? And should he go?” anchor Jorge Ramos asked him.

Sanders replied, “I think clearly he has been very, very abusive.”

But he also signaled a desire to avoid repeating the U.S. approach used in the past, such as in the 1980s, when liberals strongly opposed Washington’s aggressive intervention in Latin American affairs.

As to whether Maduro should go, he continued, “That is a decision of the Venezuelan people. So I think, Jorge, there has got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene.”

Sanders was asked whether he considered Guaidó to be the legitimate president, and he replied that he did not. Trump — as well as Democratic leaders and many Western countries — have recognized Guaidó as the interim president.

Some prominent Florida Democrats distanced themselves from Sanders’s comments.

“I’ll make it clear, @SenSanders does not reflect the majority of the Democratic Party and our support for Venezuela’s interim president @jguaido and the Venezuelan people. Maduro is a dictator and must go,” Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) tweeted on Thursday.

While Sanders is critical of Maduro, his foreign policy aide Matt Duss said Sanders forcefully opposes the option of U.S. military intervention, something the president has suggested is a possibility.

“Bernie strongly supports the right of democratic self-determination, for the Venezuelan people and those across the world,” Duss said in a statement. “The Trump administration even floating the possibility of military intervention is extremely dangerous and irresponsible, and we should be absolutely opposed to it.”

Ulvert recalled Democratic candidates in the 2018 campaign facing attacks from Republicans who sought to cast them as socialists, and he fears a repeat in 2020. “My worry level is growing every month,” he said.

Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Florida by just 1.2 percentage points in 2016. In 2018, both the governor’s race and the U.S. Senate race went to recounts.

Florida has always been a politically complex state, with major cities from Miami to Tampa to Orlando to Jacksonville. Influential voting blocs range from Latin American immigrants to Jewish retirees to dairy farmers, and tourism and the environment are among the state’s diverse concerns.

While Democrats still hold the advantage in winning Hispanic voters statewide, some party leaders worry they need to do more to counter GOP strategies there.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who served as governor for eight years before his election to Congress in November, ran Spanish-language TV ads and emphasized his outreach to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

Scott narrowly defeated Nelson, whose campaign drew complaints from within the Democratic Party, including that he was not aggressive enough in courting Hispanic voters.

Gillum, a former Tallahassee mayor, generated enthusiasm among Democrats when he won the primary in an upset, but he lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was strongly supported by Trump.

Democrats insist Florida has not slipped from their grasp — especially if they can run well-prepared campaigns that provide more face time in Latino communities.

Democrats gained two U.S. House seats in South Florida, they note, even though Nelson and Gillum lost in 2018.

But new revelations show almost no one understands what really happened back in the 1930s.,"Judge Glock is a senior policy adviser with 8vc, a venture capital firm, and the Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. He may be reached at judge@8vc.com.

Americans spent much of 2018 with their eyes trained on the Supreme Court—from its rulings on presidential travel bans and public employee unions to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle, the most heated confirmation battle in modern memory. So it should be no surprise that many are talking about ways to reform the court.

Some Democrats even want to revive the most famous, or infamous, attempt at Supreme Court reform in history: President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proposal to pack the court with extra justices in 1937. In Philadelphia this week, presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., said that court packing was “no more a departure from norms than what the Republicans did to get the judiciary to the place it is today.”

Story Continued Below

FDR’s court-packing battle is one of the best-known constitutional struggles in U.S. history. The story, as it’s often been told, pits an entrenched, reactionary Supreme Court, which overturned a slew of Roosevelt’s New Deal economic reforms, against a hubristic president willing to take the unprecedented step of asking Congress to appoint six new, and sympathetic, justices to the bench. Only a national outcry against this unconstitutional skulduggery, along with a newly cowed court that began upholding Roosevelt’s laws, stopped the plan.

Yet this narrative gets much of the court-packing episode wrong. New research I have conducted, forthcoming in the Journal of American History, demonstrates that Roosevelt saw his plan in the context of a long tradition of judicial reform, not as a departure from it. FDR wanted to encourage older justices to retire, not to add extra justices to the bench. He saw a recent, although now nearly forgotten, law cutting Supreme Court pensions as preventing retirements and thus appointments that were his due. The court-packing episode was partially an attempt to fix retirement issues—not a mere presidential power grab. And at the time, at least at first, many in the press and public agreed with him.

Today, those looking to reform the Supreme Court might want to look away from court packing and instead consider the seemingly mundane issue of judicial retirement—and how it has reshaped the court throughout its history. A new SCOTUS retirement plan might just be the best way to protect the court’s independence from the hyperpartisanship of our times.



***

Although the Constitution provides clear methods for putting judges on the bench, it says little about how to get them off. The Founding Fathers assumed federal judges would just die in their seats. Of course, back then, life expectancies were shorter than they are today. But the founders also viewed any government-provided pension as corrupt patronage the Constitution could not condone. Therefore, judges who left the bench early would sacrifice their livelihoods. As Alexander Hamilton predicted in the Federalist Papers, few did.

Starting in the 1860s, however, a series of Republican Congresses began providing full salaries and benefits to all federal judges who retired, with the explicit idea that this would encourage some of the older, and, in that era, Democratic, judges to leave. It worked and opened several seats for the Republican Party.

Yet what Congress could give, it could also take away. Although the Constitution contains a clause protecting judges’ salaries, that clause did not apply to retirement packages. This loophole has provided an unfortunate means for politicians to manipulate the court. Twice in the 50 years after the first retirement provision, Congress passed laws stating that a particular unfavored justices could only collect their retirement money if they left the court in the following few months, and the justices obliged. Such nakedly political laws became the new normal after retirement was in place.

Then, in 1932, a little-noticed Depression-era austerity act cut Supreme Court justices’ retirement salary in half, almost as an afterthought to broader cuts. At the time, President Herbert Hoover’s attorney general warned that the law meant justices “will hang on like grim death until the Angel Gabriel blows the horn.”

He was right. I discovered a previously unpublished letter in which conservative Justice Willis Van Devanter wrote to his sister, “I do not like the idea of losing half of my salary by retiring” and that he would stay on the court. In fact, no justice would retire for the next five years, the longest period without a retirement since the creation of the nine-member Supreme Court. The lack of retirements, and the subsequent conservative battle with Roosevelt, is almost certainly a result of this cut in retirement pay.

As early as 1935, Roosevelt recognized the dilemma and tried to pass a bill restoring full retirement salaries. He failed because of lingering concerns about tight budgets during the Depression. Yet the court’s continued opposition to New Deal laws, especially by the older justices, led FDR to reach for more drastic reforms. In February 1937, he proposed a bill that would appoint an extra justice for every justice older than 70 who didn’t retire. In a little noticed addendum to his proposal, he asked that Congress also restore full judicial pensions.

While today this proposal is often seen as an attempt to pack the court with six extra judges, it was in the tradition of older judicial retirement reforms. Records in the Roosevelt library and the papers of Roosevelt’s attorney general at the time, Homer Cummings, demonstrate that Roosevelt modeled his proposal after the 1860s Republican Congress’ plan, as well as a now-forgotten Democratic reform to the lower courts put in place in the 1910s, which allowed the president to appoint an extra judge for any older judge who hadn’t retired and taken his or her pension. Historians have missed the close parallels between these earlier retirement reforms and Roosevelt’s proposal. But these parallels explain why most reporters and members of Congress did not regard Roosevelt’s bill with alarm in its early days, and why most thought it would pass.

Some of the earliest critics of the bill, like the deans of New York University and Fordham law schools, however, decried the attempt to unpack the court by encouraging older judges to retire. Publicly, Roosevelt and Cummings agreed, saying that if the older justices took advantage of a newly restored pension, the court would stay at nine members.

Many popular histories today focus on the “switch in time that saved nine”—conservative Justice Owen Roberts’ public decision to start upholding New Deal measures barely two months after Roosevelt’s proposal. But, as some historians have noted, Roberts’ decision to “switch” had been made long before Roosevelt’s plan was unveiled and did little to persuade either the president or Democrats in Congress to back down from their court reform proposal. It was only after Congress passed a bill that restored justices’ full pensions, separate from Roosevelt’s overall package, and Van Devanter retired at his full salary in May 1937 that FDR’s allies gave up the fight for the larger court reform bill.

Although the retirement aspects of the 1937 court struggle have been forgotten, the 1937 Supreme Court retirement bill remains in force today and justices can retain their full pensions when they retire.

Yet the existence of judicial pensions creates problems that were unanticipated by the founders. For one, these pensions can still be can be manipulated by Congress for partisan purposes. For those concerned about politicization of the court, there is nothing to prevent a future Congress from changing retirement salaries to either encourage or discourage justices to retire, as it did from the 1860s to 1930s.

More importantly, the pension system in place since 1937 means justices can wait to leave and collect their full salary until a like-minded president and Senate are in place. With partisanship at new heights, justices now practice “strategic retirement,” meaning that they in effect pick their successor. This leads to long-term “conservative” and “liberal” seats and makes every appointment one whose effects linger for many decades. These strategic retirements further elevate the importance of every court appointment and help make them near apocalyptic struggles that would have baffled the founders, who thought justices would either leave or die at random after they were on the bench.

So what’s the answer? Is there a way to avoid both a stultified bench and SCOTUS partisan shenanigans? There is one retirement reform proposal that could improve both issues. A constitutional amendment that limits each justice to a set amount of time—say, 18 years—on the bench would mean each would have no power beyond his or her own term, limiting the importance of each appointment. It is one of the few constitutional amendments that has found support from both liberal and conservative legal professors, and it is the only one that has been endorsed by both Senator Ted Cruz and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Such a constitutional amendment would also make irrelevant proposals to either pack or unpack the Supreme Court, which have unfortunately aggravated our political divides for generations.",The Lost History of FDR’s Court-Packing Scandal,Politico,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/24/the-lost-history-of-fdrs-court-packing-scandal-225201

Put simply, Biden is the 800-pound gorilla in the Democratic race. He's led by a comfortable margin in every national poll, as well as polls in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.

Should he run, it's possible he will crowd out other candidates and leverage his institutional advantages all the way to the convention. On the other hand, right now he's benefiting from universal name recognition and years of sympathetic news coverage. Once he announces, that will change, and he'll undergo more scrutiny. He'll face questions not only about his age, but about how he's a relic from an earlier, pre-woke, version of the Democratic Party. Who can benefit from any collapse?

At the same time as redistributing a large chunk of the Democratic electorate, should he choose to take a pass, it will free up a lot of campaign talent. Also, many lawmakers who may be reluctant to endorse somebody other than Biden without knowing his intentions, will now be up for grabs.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not the future of the Democratic Party.,"Former Independent Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman doubled down Sunday on his claims that freshman Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not the future of the Democratic Party.

WATCH:

Lieberman, during a Sunday morning “Fox & Friends” appearance, argued again that Ocasio-Cortez is not the future of the Democratic Party.

“Well, I hope not,” he said. “Look, she’s a congresswoman. She won a primary. She didn’t get an enormous number of votes but enough to win. She’s one congresswoman. Incidentally, she’s not typical of the new Democrats who have been elected to the Congress. Most of them are center or left, not far left, because they won in swing districts.” (RELATED: Joe Lieberman’s Formula For Democrats Winning In 2020 Does Not Include Ocasio-Cortez)

Host Katie Pavlich reminded Lieberman of a now infamous Twitter spat between the former senator and Ocasio-Cortez that ended with the newly-sworn-in congresswoman saying of Lieberman, “New party, who dis?”

“Dis me,” Lieberman cracked with a smile. “I’ve been here awhile. Here is the point. In the American political system, the time that the parties really say what they’re about is when they nominate a presidential candidate. This is just beginning, and I’m saying that if Ocasio-Cortez is the leader of the pack, as we go into the presidential primaries next year, a candidate is going to be nominated who simply cannot get elected because America doesn’t support the big government socialistic extreme and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement that she’s been talking about, so she’s got a voice but let’s not give it, let’s not listen to it more than it deserves.”

Lieberman concluded by saying that even if embracing the Green New Deal, open borders and other extreme positions is where the “soul of the Democratic Party” is, “Well that’s not where the soul of America is, and that’s what worries me.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is fast-tracking a Green New Deal resolution through the Senate, enabling a vote as early as next week.

The resolution was authored by rising freshman star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and longtime climate advocate Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. It is nonbinding but calls for Congress to take the lead in ridding the nation of fossil fuels in the next few decades, among other dramatic environmental and economic changes.

The plan to eradicate fossil fuels is considered so drastic, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked Markey after reading the resolution, “What in the heck is this?”

Some Democrats are distancing themselves, but others will likely back the resolution, including a bevy of Democrats running for president.

“I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal,” Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who is running for president, said on Twitter. “We must aggressively tackle climate change which poses an existential threat to our nation.”

Other presidential hopefuls backing the deal include Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., as does Julian Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

But McConnell is eager to put Senate Democrats into a potentially difficult political position by forcing them to take a side. “We’ll give everyone an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,” McConnell said earlier this month.

It's not yet clear if the vote will create the wide split McConnell is looking for. Some Democrats, like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have indicated they will vote against it, and at least some Democrats are likely to vote ""no"" when forced to decide.

But the upcoming 2020 election is also a factor. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who entered the presidential race as a party moderate, hedged when asked on Fox News whether she backs the Green New Deal.

""The Green New Deal? I see it as aspirational,” Klobuchar said on Fox News. Klobuchar said she would vote yes on the resolution but not necessarily specific legislation aimed at implementing the goals laid out in the nonbinding measure.

“If it got down to the nitty-gritty of an actual legislation, as opposed to, here's some goals we have, that would be different for me,"" she said.

Democrats stumbled as they rolled out the Green New Deal in a way that allowed Republicans to mock the plan as pie-in-the-sky. It was accompanied by a fact sheet produced by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff that called for eliminating the need for air travel, retrofitting every house and building to green energy standards, and reforming the nation’s agricultural practices to eliminate cows.

Ocasio-Cortez removed the document, but Republicans plan to keep touting its radical provisions as the Senate heads toward a vote. But Ocasio-Cortez this week didn't back down from her calls to curb methane-producing cows and the proposal to end environmental damage caused by large-scale farming.

She said on a Showtime comedy show this week, “We need to take a look at factory farming, and maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.”

Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leaders know the GOP is setting a trap and call the vote on the resolution a political stunt designed to split them.

“Since Republicans took control of this chamber in 2015, they have not brought a single Republican bill to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions to the floor of the Senate,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.. “Not one bill. Republicans have controlled this chamber for over four years.

222,Empty,2019-02-22T14:47:10Z,A one-term pledge could stave off critics who say Bernie Sanders is too old — and allow him to focus on passing bold policies without worry of re-election. The post Why Bernie Sanders Should Promise to Serve Only One Term as President appeared first on The In…,"Nevertheless, his age is still an issue. It would be mad to pretend otherwise . “Since 1828,” reported Axios on Wednesday, “only 3 Democratic presidents have been in their 60s when inaugurated — and none came close to Sanders, who would be 79 if elected in 2020.”

“We began the political revolution in the 2016 campaign, and now it’s time to move that revolution forward,” Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday morning, as he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. Within 24 hours, he had raised a whopping $6 million from more than 200,000 donors. And according to the latest polls , he is the most popular of the declared candidates.

If he were to win the next election, the independent senator from Vermont, who is five years older than Donald Trump, would be the oldest president in the history of the United States — six years older than Ronald Reagan was when he won re-election in 1984. In terms of the Democratic primaries, if 77-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden chooses not to run, Sanders will be the only candidate above the age of 70 come the first round of Democratic presidential debates this summer.

So how does he neutralize this issue?

There is a possible — if unconventional — solution: Sanders should promise to serve only one term in the White House. Four years max! 2020 and done!

A one-term pledge isn’t as crazy as it might sound. As the Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted in 2015:

Three American presidents made — and kept — pledges to serve one term at most. Rutherford B. Hayes and James K. Polk made one-term pledges; each served one term. William Henry Harrison, our second-oldest president at 68, also took a pledge to serve only one term, a pledge that was in keeping with his Whig Party. That pledge turned out not to matter; he barely served a full month before dying.

In recent years, high-profile — and older — figures in both parties have seriously entertained the idea. Seventy-year-old John McCain was “inches away” from making a one-term pledge when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2007. Then-73-year-old Biden considered it in 2015, and may do so again this time around.

Think about it: There are several clear advantages to any older candidate, but especially Sanders, renouncing any ambition to serve a second term in the Oval Office. For a start, while Sanders and his surrogates might be able to defend the idea of a president who is in his late 70s, they might struggle to convince voters that he’d be as effective in his late 80s (he’d be, ahem, 87 at the end of his second term).

There are benefits beyond just Sanders’s age. Making such a pledge would be a dramatic and bold move that could shake up the Democratic primaries. Whether we like it or not, horse race-obsessed reporters and pundits love dramatic and bold moves. The more unconventional, the better. Sanders would immediately stand out from a crowded Democratic field, many of whom have adopted his ideas on everything from health care to higher education. It would make the Vermont senator look like he is interested only in the issues — in contrast to the naked ambitions of some of his younger rivals.

In fact, one of Sanders’s biggest selling points has always been that he is an independent and an outsider. A one-term pledge would only reinforce that iconoclastic image and boost his anti-establishment appeal with the millions of Americans who loathe the Washington political class.

His rationale for such a pledge could be both simple and popular: As president, he would be free of re-election pressures and distractions, allowing him to devote a full four years to two or three major issues: Medicare For All, a Green New Deal, and, maybe, free college for all, too.

A one-term pledge would only reinforce that iconoclastic image and boost his anti-establishment appeal.

There is a danger, of course, that a one-term president would be seen as a lame-duck. Maybe. On the other hand, Sanders would come to office with a very specific and time-sensitive mandate to get things done. His pledge might make it harder for Republicans in the Senate to block his agenda, given he’ll have been elected to serve only four years and won’t face the re-election pressures that they will. And, in terms of his legacy, he would also be dodging the second-term curse that has plagued so many previous presidents.

Finally, in declaring that he would only serve four years in office, Sanders could bestow much more significance on whomever he picks as his running mate. There is an opportunity here for the senator to address the “identity politics” objection to his candidacy, or what some might call his “old white guy” problem.

This is the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in American history. Plenty of people in the party’s base, even those who are ardent fans of the Vermont senator and his politics, don’t want an all-white or all-male presidential ticket (and for good reason!).

So why not put Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for Georgia governor in 2018, on the ticket — and all but guarantee her the Democratic presidential nomination come 2024? She is black (check), a woman (check), progressive (check), and unites the various wings of the Democratic Party like no other politician in the United States.",Why Bernie Sanders Should Promise to Serve Only One Term as President,Theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2019/02/22/bernie-sanders-2020-one-term-pledge/
223,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:47Z,The two old socialists have done an impressive job at shifting progressive politics from the staid status quo. Now they should leave the matter of governing to others.,"On both sides of the Atlantic, a hectoring old white man looms over the political left.

In the US, senator Bernie Sanders has finally announced his candidacy for a Democratic primary race filled with younger, more capable, versions of himself. In the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is presiding over the left’s biggest split in decades. Neither looks likely to give up soon, and that’s a problem.

While the similarities between the two candidates have been long remarked upon, and the two old socialists themselves have even acknowledged using each others’ campaigning ideas, their policy priorities aren’t actually perfectly aligned—Sanders’ most radical policies would find a comfortable home with Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats, while his history on guns and abortion would be on the hard-right for a British politician. However, the two men are almost identical candidates in all the worst ways.

Impressive policy shifts

Firstly, it bears noting that progressives in both countries have a fair amount to thank both men for—both have shifted their previously centrist parties towards leftist platforms that are genuinely popular with voters tired of the Blair-Clinton “third way.” These include policies such as Sanders’ Medicare for all, free college tuition, and $15 minimum wage, and Corbyn’s push for a “green jobs revolution,” railway nationalization, and an end to abusive hiring practices. They have driven a considerable amount of activism and enthusiasm, with Sanders racking up extraordinary levels of small-dollar donations and Labour membership surging under Corbyn.

Their platforms have had real impacts on national politics. The Democrats won back the House last year on “Better Deal” policies partly cribbed from Sanders’ 2016 campaign. While facing Corbyn, the leadership of the Conservative party has been taken out of the hands of a cabal of upper-class free-marketeers presiding over radical austerity, and handed to a flock of middle-class incompetents who—were they not tying themselves in knots over Brexit—would love to be trying to win over blue collar voters.

Both men should look proudly at these accomplishments, but they should let others take the helm. For all the impressive shifts Sanders and Corbyn have delivered in their respective political landscapes, their personal drawbacks pose more far more harm than good to the left in their countries.

Party schisms

Let’s start with the obvious: the rifts they have caused in their countries’ leftist parties. (Note that Sanders has still never joined the Democratic party.)

The 2016 Democratic primaries were fought with such bitterness, that, as the leader of a grassroots activist group told me almost a year after the election, “We literally cannot say the names Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in any of our groups because people are still so split about it.”

For Corbyn, the divide is starker. This week saw the Labour party’s biggest rupture in living memory, with eight MPs quitting to form a new independent voting block in Parliament. The group hasn’t ruled out running against Labour MPs in marginal seats where they risk splitting the progressive vote.

Equally damaging is how the two have reacted to the rifts, showing uncannily similar levels of stubbornness. Many Clinton supporters blame Sanders in part for her loss to Donald Trump, suggesting his refusal to throw his weight behind her—and his holding out on conceding the race after it was clear she would win—led many Sanders voters to either stay home or even back Trump. Corbyn, meanwhile, simply refuses to engage with his critics. Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson has begged for him to treat the MPs’ departures seriously, but Corbyn has merely said he is “disappointed,” without acknowledging the legitimacy of their grievances.

Overlooked women and minorities

The two politicians have so far failed to win power in large part because of their unwillingness to deal with issues of race and gender.

Sanders, who surrounded himself with largely white male advisers, has systematically declined to seriously consider racism and sexism as problems in their own right, instead viewing them as outcomes of widespread economic inequality. Unsurprisingly, Clinton trounced him among minority and female voters.

Since then, female staffers on his 2016 campaign have said there was both pay inequality and “an entire wave of rotten sexual harassment that seemingly was never dealt with,” such as one top staffer allegedly forcibly kissing a subordinate and another treating women “like his personal assistants.” Black staffers have complained of micro-aggressions, lackluster outreach efforts to African American voters, and feeling as if the campaign had black staff “just to say you have black staff.”

Sanders made an equivocal apology to those alleging sexual harassment, saying, “I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.” He has since made a more full-throated apology.

He has also exacerbated matters by stumping for an anti-abortion mayoral candidate and suggesting that it wasn’t necessarily racist for white people to feel uncomfortable about voting for a black candidate.

Corbyn tarnished his self-declared feminism in his first week as Labour leader, announcing a shadow cabinet with no women in the top three posts. Instead of acknowledging that he hadn’t properly considered the matter beforehand, as seemingly revealed by an interaction between Corbyn and a lieutenant overheard by journalists, Corbyn accused critics of “living in the 18th century.” His claim: that those jobs are now no more important than less prominent shadow cabinet posts like health and business secretary. A year later, when Labour named a roster of white men as its candidates for big city mayorships, a backbench Labour MP wrote: “I suppose feminism is out of the window when your brothers in arms want the jobs.”

The Labour leader has said that MPs who harass women “must be held to account,” but shortly after a Labour activist told leadership that an MP had sent her suggestive texts and made inappropriate sexual contact, the MP was briefly promoted. When another MP was revealed to have a history of making misogynistic and homophobic comments, it took days for Corbyn to suspend him.

Despite a lifetime as an avowed anti-racist, Corbyn has presided over a Labour party in which antisemitism has brewed to such dangerous levels that, when quitting the party this week, Luciana Berger, one of the most prominent Jewish Labour MPs, called the party “sickeningly institutionally racist.” Several men have been prosecuted for sending Berger antisemitic death threats over the years, but when the party found out about an assault threat last year, it told neither her nor the police. The fact that one Labour MP responded to Berger’s and others’ defection by suggesting they were funded by Israel says everything you need to know about the state of the party under Corbyn.

With the advent of Trumpism, Brexit, and #MeToo, the Anglo-American world is at a historic juncture on misogyny and xenophobia, in which the next leader of each country could either entrench existing ills or take a road of reconciliation and progress. Sanders’ and Corbyn’s permissive records on the subjects show they are in no position to do the latter.

Vapid foreign policies

While Sanders barely had a foreign policy in 2016, both men share an anti-imperialist worldview that can lead to troubling stances. Both have questioned their countries’ membership of NATO. Corbyn once suggested the military alliance set up to defend the West during the Cold War should “close down” and Sanders paradoxically called for it to be expanded to include Russia.

In the latest example of their distaste for interventionism, both likened international recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as president to Cold War-era American imperialism, branding it “outside interference” (Corbyn) and “supporting coups” (Sanders). That’s despite Guaidó being backed by almost all of Latin America.

Often the rejection of intervention serves as a way of avoiding taking tough decisions, allowing them to continue a career-long pattern of criticizing from the outside without offering solutions. For example, both have opposed military action in Syria. That’s an understandable position, but it’s unclear how they would actually fix the problem. In one beat, Sanders called for a US military drawdown, then added, “Assad has got to go. ISIS has got to be defeated.” How exactly will that happen? Meanwhile, Corbyn insists that “diplomacy and not bombing” is the answer. However, diplomacy has failed time and again—as to what Corbyn would do differently, we are none the wiser.

Similarly, both are queasy about free market trade agreements, but they’ve failed to articulate what they want instead aside from vague protectionism. A Brexiter at heart, Corbyn’s refusal to really throw his campaigning skills behind the Remain cause is seen as one reason they lost. It ultimately took him until Feb. 2019 to detail what he actually wanted from a Brexit deal, and some of that may not even be tenable.

As Trump himself has acknowledged, he and Sanders have rather similar views on trade. Sanders told the Daily Beast last year, “[Trump] is identifying the problem correctly but I’m not sure that his particular solution at this moment is exactly the right one.” What solution did Sanders suggest? Platitudes about “a more comprehensive approach than Trump is laying out” and calling for Congress to “begin to rethink our trade policies.”

Unfit to govern

Both superb campaigners, Sanders and Corbyn have corralled such blind, messianic support that their followers are unable to acknowledge the obvious: neither man is capable of governing.

Corbyn has run the Labour Party as a shambolic autocracy. His aides once accidentally published his “enemies list” of 14 MPs, one of whom was included for the petty reason of telling a Corbyn ally to “fuck off.” He has systematically alienated swaths of his MPs. The group who left this week did so in part out of the belief that he would just be a bad prime minister.

The past six weeks should have been a time of reckoning for Corbyn. With Theresa May facing historic defeats in the commons over her Brexit deal, Corbyn had the chance to show real leadership and steer the talks in the direction that Labour’s europhile base wants. Instead, he hasn’t even forced May to rule out a ‘no deal’ Brexit, preferring to hope the Conservatives fall apart and he can take the helm of whatever mess they eventually leave behind. He put personal ambition ahead of the country’s needs at a time of national crisis.

The left is now definitively fractured in Britain. Any progressive government would likely need to work in coalition with the new Independent Group and perhaps the Liberal Democrats. The fact that Corbyn hasn’t even been able to hold the party together suggests he wouldn’t have the skills to run a coalition as prime minister. Labour membership is so supportive of his domestic policy positions that it’s hard to imagine a new leader taking the party in a radically different ideological direction—however, they could make it fit to govern.

As for Sanders, his failure to grapple with the intricacies of governing was put in excruciating view when the editorial board of New York’s leftist tabloid, the Daily News, skewered him with basic questions about how he’d implement key policy proposals such as breaking up the banks and jailing Wall Street CEOs.

If you think that was a one-off, look at his past. When Politico quizzed lawmakers on his record from decades in Congress, it found that his big picture thinking has “rarely…translated into actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.” One political scientist found Sanders was a generally below average senator in terms of impact on legislation, as measured by successful bills authored and amendments passed. His only executive experience is as mayor of tiny Burlington. He lost three attempts at running for governor of Vermont—his best result was winning 14% of the vote as an independent in 1986. If Vermonters don’t think he’s up to running one of America’s smallest states, what are his chances of success in governing the whole country?

Sanders’ opponents in the primary are running on strikingly similar policies to his. The candidates also just happen to be more competent than him, either with more governing experience (whether via cabinet posts, law enforcement roles, or big city mayorships), better legislative chops, or more policy smarts.

The two old lefties have changed national politics in ways they couldn’t have dreamed of five years ago.

If I were a young person entering politics, I'd be looking for the best résumé-enhancers, to see what sort of qualifications and accomplishments are shared by those ""getting ahead"" in today's political arena.

After serving as a Chicago community organizer and Illinois state senator, Barack Obama rose from a pedestrian three years as a U.S. senator to become the 44th president of the United States. Coming out of a corrupt city and a corrupt state with corrupt politicians (four of the last seven Illinois governors have been jailed), Obama had a few election irregularities of his own that were basically unreported by the media. Also largely ignored by the media was Obama's choice of mentor-pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who would regularly condemn America and white people from the pulpit on Sunday mornings, using coarse and inflammatory language.

Obama gave great speeches about bringing Hope and Change, which were short on specifics but emotionally appealing to many voters. The lack of any specific plans to make America better was an appalling shortcoming of Obama's campaign, but the media ignored it. Instead, the media fell in love with the idea that America had a chance to elect its first black president, so Obama's actual accomplishments, character, and intended policies were given short shrift. Tom Brokaw and Charlie Rose, two of America's most recognized journalists, admitted in an interview a few days before the 2008 election that they didn't know what books might be important to Obama and didn't know anything about his foreign policy views. The fact that these highly influential media figures purposely chose to remain clueless about Obama's beliefs and the policies he would promote as leader of the free world is a stunning admission of incompetency and journalistic malpractice. Instead of being journalists presenting facts, the media hid important facts about Obama from the voters in an obvious attempt to influence the election.

In 2016, the Democratic nominee for president was Hillary Clinton. Her résumé included conducting top-secret State Department business on her own unsecured home server, as well as raking in hundreds of millions of dollars donated by U.S. citizens and foreigners alike to the Clinton Foundation, money probably given with expectations of a future return on the ""investments"" from the likely to be elected President Clinton. To cover her misdeeds, she destroyed electronic records and devices while they were under subpoena, and those aides closest to her were granted immunity by Obama's complicit FBI, resulting in a tainted investigation that concluded without any consequences for Clinton's years of nefarious activities. Again, the media were enamored of the possibility that we might actually have our first female president and therefore chose to hide Clinton's blatant corruption from the voters..

Donald Trump, in contrast, was subjected to intense media scrutiny and won the 2016 election despite the media's allegation factory running nearly 24-7. The media breathlessly announced, sometimes with hundreds of references in a single 24-hour news cycle, that Trump was dishonest; crude; hateful; and a racist reality TV personality in danger of ruining the economy, starting WWIII, and so on. But many voters ignored the media's focus and instead looked at Trump's record of building businesses (Trump owns approximately 500 business entities employing about 22,000 people) as well as his skills in negotiating and compromising with different groups in order to achieve meaningful and long-lasting results. The Trump résumé was based on real accomplishments in the real world, and when Trump, the rookie politician, spoke of a set of specific policies aimed at Making America Great Again, many voters were convinced he was speaking from his heart and therefore just might pursue fulfilling his campaign promises with the same vigor and tenacity they perceived to be part of his character and track record. Today, thanks to Trump's policies and fulfilled campaign promises, we have a booming economy with wages rising across the board and unemployment rates the lowest ever for blacks and Hispanics.

It is clear that the right and left prefer radically different résumés for their leaders. They also prefer different styles of communication. Politicians use softly spoken magic words to appeal to voters, and it's evident that the Left and right prefer radically different prose. What's magic for the Left is words that make them feel good, words that say to a leftist that you are important because you are part of a group that is so much smarter and more righteous than the other side, that you are good and classy because the side you have chosen is against hate and racism.

The right has a different set of magic words, oriented toward implementing solutions to specific problems, so its voters tend to be favorably inclined toward leaders who have already accomplished great things. America faces great problems, and those on the right would like to empower leaders offering solutions that have already been tried and proven to work.

Simply put, the right wants to make life better for its kids and grandkids, while today's Left wants to be the boss of America, which leftists hope to achieve through making the government ever larger so it can intrude into more and more of the average person's life. The Green New Deal is the Democrat's shiny new toy, which expands government so much that it will surely bankrupt our nation. Yet over 70 Democrats in Congress are already offering their public support for the GND. Have they learned nothing from Obama's tremendous expansion of government, which led to a near doubling of our national debt in just eight years? If the expansion of government and debt is left unchecked, eventually, America will collapse due to insolvency.

No doubt, we live in perilous times with an uncertain future. Is there anything on the horizon coming our way that may prevent America from becoming a failed, bankrupt state? I think there is a chance that recent events in Virginia may well be showing us how America can come back from the brink of self-destruction.

Virginia's Democratic leadership team is now being blown up due to past behaviors and transgressions. While Republicans tend to prevent seriously flawed people from rising far by using a kind of self-policing, the Democrats, always coddled by the media that hide their character flaws and gross malfeasance, have never had to consistently apply a standard of ethics in order to weed out those inclined toward behaving badly. Rather than great character or great accomplishments, the media and the Democrats years ago started using identity politics to select their leaders.

Recently, identity politics has increasingly been used as a cudgel to force people from office and other positions of power and influence. And what's new is that now, in Virginia, identity politics as cudgel is being applied with vigor against high-ranking Democrats. Do the Democrats realize that the runaway freight train of identity politics has left the station and is now bearing down directly at them? They've created this train, and the engineers running the train are the leftists and journalism majors and politicians who so far seem powerless to stop the coming wave of self-destruction.

The Democratic Party is approaching an all-important fork in the road. Either the Democrats choose common sense, humility, and patriotism to redirect their choice of policies, tactics, and leaders or, like the Whigs and the Know-Nothings before them, the Democrats and their identity politics will eventually vanish from the American political landscape.",Democratic and Republican Résumé-Enhancers,Americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/02/democratic_and_republican_rsumenhancers.html
226,Empty,2019-02-22T03:36:23Z,Constitutional Court to meet next week as Thai Raksa Chart faces ban over Princess Ubolratana nomination.,"Bangkok, Thailand - With Thailand's long-delayed elections just over a month away, a court ruling is expected to deal a major blow to parties loyal to overthrown ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and tip the scales in favour of the country's military government - even as many voters appear weary of the generals after five years of army rule.

The Constitutional Court on Wednesday is expected to dissolve Thai Raksa Chart following the party's shock nomination of Princess Ubolratana which later failed. Ubolratana is the king's older sister and was the party's candidate for prime minister in the March 24 polls.

Pheu Thai, the main pro-Thaksin party, may also find itself guilty by association at a later date, according to political analyst Supalak Ganjanakhundee, managing editor at The Nation.

""It may not be too difficult to link the two parties together. Some members of Thai Raska Chart came from the Pheu Thai party,"" he said. ""I anticipate the military will find some measure to block Pheu Thai [before the election] because it's seen as a threat.""

The Pheu Thai party declined to comment.

Two weeks ago, Thai Raksa Chart stunned Thailand when it put forward Princess Ubolratana, who became a commoner after marrying a US citizen in 1972, as its candidate for prime minister.

190208084214293

Although Ubolratana returned to Thailand after getting a divorce and is now known as a TV star and actress, the monarchy is said to be above politics and is protected by strictly enforced laws on lese majeste.

Thailand's Election Commission swiftly disqualified her candidacy, saying the nomination was unconstitutional and hostile towards the monarchy. The move came after King Vajiralongkorn said it was ""improper and highly inappropriate"" for a royal family member to delve into fractious Thai politics.

Meanwhile this week, Thai police said they were also seeking the prosecution of Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of Future Forward - a party pitched at younger voters making its electoral debut next month - over a speech shared online in June last year criticising the military.

'Total control'

Parties connected to Thaksin, a telecoms tycoon, have dominated Thai politics for nearly two decades.

But two of the 19 coups that have taken place since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, have replaced pro-Thaksin governments.

Pheu Thai won the last elections in 2011 but was usurped by a coup three years later when the current military government - the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) - seized power from Yingluck Shinawatra, the sister of Thaksin.

Thai Rak Thai Party, Pheu Thai's predecessor, was dissolved in 2007 following the removal of Thaksin in a coup a year earlier. The party's next incarnation, Palang Prachachon, was dissolved by the court in 2008.

""We don't know whether we'll be able to make it to the polls or not,"" Umesh Pandey, a member of the Thai Raksa Chart party.

""We are fighting against a regime that seized power five years ago. They have total control of how things are run.""

After taking control of the country and tightening the military's hold over politics, General Prayuth Chan-ocha is now trying to also become an elected prime minister through the Phalang Pracharat Party.

The 2017 military-drafted constitution almost assures the generals' continued control of the National Assembly.

The 500 members of the lower house will be chosen by both direct vote - 350 seats - and party list - 150 seats - from across the country's 77 provinces.

The military will appoint a panel to select all 250 members of the upper house so only 126 elected members would need to support Prayuth as prime minister and extend the military's hold on power.

Red, yellow and orange

Overall, there are 77 political parties that have registered for the polls.

The two oldest are the Democrat and Mahachon parties, but most are newcomers - like Future Forward - hoping to appeal to voters no longer interested in the divisive colour-coded politics of the past.

Future Forward's orange triangular logo is said to be the result of mixing yellow-shirt royalists and red-shirt Thaksin supporters. Its leader, Thanathorn, a successful business tycoon, has been likened to Thaksin.

190211092412442

""Our main policy is to amend the constitution,"" said Sirikanya Tansakun, policy director at Future Forward. ""We want military reform to stop this endless cycle of military coups and disruptions in governance.""

Like Future Forward, Pheu Thai's ""Next Gen"" and the Democrats ""New Dem"" social media campaigns are targeting young Thai voters with videos and messages.

They are all vying for the backing of nearly seven million first-time voters to put an end to one of Thailand's longest periods of army rule, pledging to reverse the military government's policies.

Chulalongkorn University student Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal is one of them.

The 22-year-old made headlines in 2016 after a public spat with Prayuth over his refusal to kowtow along with other university students before a statue of King Rama V.

(China Dialogue) – The weeks after the Democratic Party won back control of the House of Representatives saw the longest government shutdown in US history, as President Trump unsuccessfully demanded money to pay for a wall on the Mexican border. Now that the shutdown is over, Democrats have started setting the agenda, and climate change is right at the top.

After delivering a storming victory in the midterm elections the new Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, was probably not expecting to be greeted with protests. But that’s what immediately faced her. Hordes of young activists sat outside her office demanding action on climate change. Newly elected members from the left-wing of the party, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, increased the pressure, demanding that the party pursue a more radical agenda in line with the scale of the climate challenge and America’s responsibility to address it.

On February 7 they got their way. Ocasio-Cortez tabled a resolution calling for a Green New Deal, which, at the time of writing, has more than 60 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and is backed by most Democrat presidential candidates, including Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.

Back on the table

Climate change has been off the table under Republican control of the House for the past eight years, so this has been a dramatic and unexpected change. Democrats are still a long way from being able to make laws – Republicans control the Senate and Donald Trump is still president – so the resolution is seen by many as symbolic, an opportunity for Democrats to make clear what they stand for. And the Green New Deal is an admirably clear articulation of a new climate agenda.

Those framing the Green New Deal take seriously the stark warnings set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the recent National Climate Assessment. The resolution calls for a 10-year national mobilisation “on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal” with the aim of getting to net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. Renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure and clean public transport are at the heart of the plan.

The Deal has brought climate change to the front of voters’ minds

The resolution avoids some of the more heated debates among activists and experts. There is no specific mention of nuclear energy, for example, only the aim to “meet 100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.”

Public awareness of the Green New Deal is low. Before its launch, only 17% of Americans had heard of it. But support for its contents, at this early stage, is surprisingly high: 81% of polled voters said they support the proposal.

Radical versus incremental

The resolution has sparked a fierce debate within the Democratic Party. Should the party be proposing such clear, radical ideas, in line with the scale of the problems the country faces? Or should it adopt a more incremental approach? And are big, simple ideas necessary to win elections? The Democrats have traditionally been cautious in their approach to climate, favouring incremental reforms, ideally with the backing of business. This approach has failed, been stymied or overturned by Republicans every time.

The Green New Deal is considerably more radical than the “Cap and Trade” bill which was passed by the House of Representatives before dying in the Senate in 2009, or President Obama’s subsequent Clean Power Plan. Both of these schemes had more modest targets, with significantly less government spending.

Ernie Moniz, energy secretary under former president Obama, who favours a more conciliatory approach, said, “It’s just impracticable… If we start putting out impracticable targets we may lose a lot of key constituencies that we need to bring along”.

The green dream?

Other critics of the plan point to different social policies it includes. Providing all members of society “with high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security” are laudable goals, but how will they be paid for? For her part, Speaker of the House Pelosi described it, somewhat dismissively, as the “green dream or whatever”.

Republicans have also sought to discredit the deal, deliberately mischaracterising its contents. President Trump sarcastically tweeted: “I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called ‘Carbon Footprint’ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!”

While in the Senate, Republicans moved to force an immediate vote on the issue, with the aim of forcing more moderate Democrats to either vote for it, or oppose parts of their own voter base, weakening their chances of winning subsequent elections. A small minority of Republicans see this as an opportunity to advance their own, moderate climate proposals, including a small carbon tax.

Wherever it leads, it’s clear that the Green New Deal has brought climate change to the front of the minds of voters and politicians. Fierce public fights within and between political parties will now continue into the presidential campaign. In less than two months in office, Ocasio-Cortez has completely upended climate politics in the United States.

229,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:00Z,Relentless discussion may harm our democracy and inflame partisan dysfunction.,"That’s one reason that, in June 2017, we resolved to write a book on the history, law, and strategy of impeachment. At the time, the nation was already debating an array of alleged “high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” We wanted to offer a realistic, evenhanded vision of the impeachment power.

Of course, the process of writing a book is itself educational. We undertook a wide-ranging historical study of calls to impeach American presidents. Not just the standard trio of Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton, but also many others who faced down impeachment efforts in the House or mainstream press.

This led us to some fascinating and unexpected stories. It also helped us recognize that modern Americans invoke impeachment faster and more aggressively than any other generation in history. Yes, Trump is a special case. But a permanent impeachment campaign produces severely disruptive effects on our political system.

In ways large and small, the Trump-presidency death watch influences news coverage and commentary. A remarkable number of stories are judged, explained, and assigned significance by reference to their role in the anticipated narrative of Trump’s removal. Rather than prioritizing questions about the legality, morality, or wisdom of Trump’s conduct, many analysts fixate on whether we’ve finally hit midnight on the Impeachment Clock. “Are we there yet?” becomes the first response to each new revelation.

The president wins—and everyone else loses—when the main framework for evaluating his conduct is whether it will trigger impeachment. By battling on that terrain, he preemptively sets aside most standards by which a democracy should judge its leader. He also invigorates his base by turning every dispute into a referendum on his presidency. That’s why he constantly tweets about threats to impeach him or invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. He wants these issues to be front and center—and mired in partisan conflicts.

For instance, during the confirmation fight over now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump warned that Democrats might try to impeach him for nominating Kavanaugh. In so doing, Trump aimed to shore up his position by framing criticism of Kavanaugh as part of an illegitimate, bad-faith effort to undermine his presidency. Similarly, during the 2018 midterms, Trump repeatedly brought up impeachment to encourage voters to support GOP candidates. “If [impeachment] does happen,” he told his audience, “it’s your fault, because you didn’t go out to vote. Okay? You didn’t go out to vote.”

Over time, a focus on impeachment can flatten and distort our politics. Many of Trump’s worst policies can’t properly be squeezed into an impeachment framework. The same might be said about many of Trump’s scariest foreign-policy judgments and public statements. The Muslim ban, family separation, erratic negotiations with North Korea, and inaction on climate change—these are abhorrent policies, but they are not impeachable offenses. When the only worthwhile end game is Trump’s removal from office, justifiable outrage over these issues too quickly recedes into the background, even as we are treated to an endless diet of speculative headlines about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s secret files.",Don’t Let Impeachment Dominate Politics,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/why-democrats-shouldnt-talk-about-impeaching-trump/583195/

A year earlier, the provocation might have stoked lasting outrage.

On Jan. 23, lawmakers from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) walked out of an official Holocaust commemoration event in Munich, in protest of a speech critical of the party from an 86-year-old survivor.

But this time, the backlash was muted.

“There was no massive outcry,” said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The stunt was hardly new for the AfD, which in recent years has sought to downplay the crimes of the Nazi era and challenge the central role of the Holocaust in German cultural memory. Senior figures in the party have demanded an end to the “guilt cult” around Nazi-era crimes, dismissed the Third Reich as “just bird shit” in the scope of German history, derided a Holocaust memorial as a “monument of shame”, and insisted that Germans have the right to feel proud of their ancestors who fought in the Second World War.

“The attempt to relativize Nazi crimes is not only abusive to any Shoah survivor but also dangerous for the whole society.”

Led by two of the party’s most powerful figures — Alexander Gauland, the 77-year-old co-leader and co-founder, and his close ally, the influential far-right agitator Bjoern Hoecke — the AfD has launched a concerted attack on Germany’s relationship with its Nazi past. They say their aim is to restore national pride and liberate Germans from the sense of collective responsibility for the crimes of their ancestors, which they claim has “crippled” the country.

Their strategy of inflammatory statements appears to be having its intended effect. And the feeble reaction to the Munich stunt was proof, experts said.

“That’s a sign to the party that they can get away with these statements, and continue to escalate on this issue,” Janning told VICE News.

The AfD is playing a dangerous game, experts and fellow politicians warned, calculated to erode the established red lines of Germany’s postwar order, in which an active reckoning with the Holocaust is fundamental to the country’s identity as a tolerant, liberal democracy.

Political scientists say the AfD’s strategy could help fuel a new wave of German nationalism, and their concerns are shared by the country’s domestic intelligence agency, which last month placed the hard-line faction behind the revisionist push under surveillance, as a threat to the liberal democratic order.

“The attempt to relativize Nazi crimes is not only abusive to any Shoah survivor but also dangerous for the whole society,” Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told VICE News. “The call for a turn in the culture of commemoration is jeopardizing Germany’s coming to terms with history, and the lessons learned from it.”

Hoecke, a hardline ideologue who is head of the ultranationalist AfD faction known as “The Wing,” was the first to publicly push revisionist views. In a January 2017 speech to the party’s youth wing, Young Alternative, the 46-year-old sensationally called for “a 180-degree turnaround” in Germany’s “stupid” politics of remembrance.

The comments led to him being accused by political opponents of being a Nazi, or at least sounding like one, and even condemned by his own party leader at the time, Frauke Petry. Her executive filed a motion for him to be expelled from the party for displaying an “affinity to National Socialism.”

But the motion eventually failed. Petry — now viewed as a moderate by the standards of the AfD — announced she was stepping down from the leadership months later. She was succeeded by Hoecke’s ally Gauland and Jörg Meuthen, a 57-year-old economist and professor, who both expressed their support for Hoecke, and the party’s internal arbitration panel ruled last May that Hoecke had done nothing wrong.

Experts say the party’s growing embrace of revisionist positions since Hoecke’s initial provocation underlines the extent to which the hard-liners from Hoecke’s faction, supported by Gauland, have prevailed in the party’s internal power struggles, shaping the AfD in their image, and pushing the group even further to the fringe.

“The power struggle is over, and Hoecke won,” German political scientist Hans-Joachim Funke told VICE News. “With every party convention, each year the party has been more and more radicalized. Without Hoecke and The Wing, there would be no party like the AfD.”

Ugly rhetoric, ugly impact

The revisionist campaign is a dangerous development in a country contending with surging far-right activity since Chancellor Angela Merkel opened its borders to 1 million refugees in 2015, manifesting in rising extremist violence and regular nationalist demonstrations. In the 2017 national elections, the AfD, which had never had a seat in the Bundestag, won nearly 13 percent of the national vote, and has polled higher since.

While the AfD’s revisionism stops short of Holocaust denial, which is a crime in Germany, its rhetoric has been blamed for fueling ugly scenes at former concentration camp sites.

On Feb. 4, a Berlin-based far-right activist, Nikolai Nerling, got into a confrontation at the Dachau concentration camp memorial site, and was ejected. From outside the grounds, he issued a rallying call on social media for others to visit concentration camp sites and declare that they didn’t feel guilty about what had happened there.

While Nerling is unaffiliated with the AfD, the Association for International Youth Exchange and Memorial Work in Dachau, whose members witnessed the episode, partly blamed the party’s rhetoric for his actions.

“This act shows how secure the extreme right-wing perpetrators feel, and how far the boundaries of what can be said and what can be done have already been shifted,” the group said in a statement. Charlotte Knobloch, the Jewish community leader whose speech provoked the AfD’s walkout in Munich, agreed that the party held some responsibility, labeling the AfD “spiritual arsonists.”

The AfD did not respond to multiple requests for comment from VICE News.

The party’s own supporters have also been linked to revisionist provocations at a former concentration camp site. In July 2018, an AfD-organized group tour to the site of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg was reportedly cut short when members made comments questioning the existence of Nazi gas chambers.

“Our constitution is a direct reaction to the horrors of the Nazi regime.”

The party’s revisionism, besides being dangerous, may also be unconstitutional, crossing the red lines of Germany’s liberal democratic order.

“Our constitution is a direct reaction to the horrors of the Nazi regime,” Konstantin von Notz, vice chairman of the Greens parliamentary group, told VICE News. An active reckoning with Germany’s responsibility for the Holocaust, he said, “must always be a factor in how we build our society.”

Last month, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, which has the power to conduct surveillance on groups it deems as extremist threats to the democratic order, announced it was stepping up its surveillance of two elements of the AfD — Hoecke’s “Wing” and the party’s youth affiliate, Young Alternative.

Agency head Thomas Haldenwang said Hoecke’s faction was “a threat to the liberal democratic principles of Germany’s constitution,” citing its repeated downplaying of Nazi crimes, along with its efforts to disparage and disenfranchise minorities.

“If you do this once, you provoke a strong reaction. But if you do it a second, third, fourth, or tenth time — that response can gradually weaken. That’s what they’re hoping for.”

His office said it was also designating the AfD as a whole as a “review case” — which means it will be investigated to determine whether it poses a threat to the liberal democratic order that should be placed under surveillance.

The decision drew a predictably dismissive response from Hoecke. “I'm already sorry for the officials who have to kill their time looking for things that do not exist,"" he said.

With his hard-line faction now dominant within the party, it remains to be seen whether it will take the intelligence agency’s interest as a sign to moderate its rhetoric, or continue toward its vision of remaking German politics.

To Janning, at the European Council on Foreign Relations, the party’s hard-liners appear determined to wear down the public’s response to its provocations, until their revisionist rhetoric can fly without any significant pushback.

“In a society like ours, the public’s attention span is short,” he said. “If you do this once, you provoke a strong reaction. But if you do it a second, third, fourth, or tenth time — that response can gradually weaken. That’s what they’re hoping for.”

With Africa’s most populous country delaying its Feb. 16 elections over logistics issues, Nigerians will now vote tomorrow (Feb. 23).

But the saga is happening at the expense of Senegal, which is set to vote for its next president on Sunday (Feb. 24) in polls which, in comparison to Nigeria’s, have been far less discussed. Unlike Nigeria, Senegal has had no logistics-related problems so far, and election observers expect the vote to go forward as planned. But like in Nigeria, Senegal’s youth—a large majority of the 6.6 million registered voters—will likely decide the outcome of the vote.

Following constitutional reforms in 2016, Senegal’s next president will serve only five years in office, down from the seven-year terms served by former presidents. The reforms also limit presidents to two terms in office and pegs ages of presidential candidates at a maximum of 75. The reforms were a key campaign promise of incumbent president Macky Sall when he won office in 2012.

Sall, now seeking re-election as the front-runner candidate, is up against a mixed opposition pool including establishment politicians like Idrissa Seck, a former prime minister, and Madické Niang, a former foreign minister, as well as anti-establishment candidates like Ousmane Sonko and Issa Sall, both with meager experience in politics. Sonko has particularly drawn comparisons (link in French) to US president Donald Trump as he’s whipped up nationalist sentiments with rhetoric like promising to, if elected, change Senegal’s CFA Franc currency, a legacy of its colonial ties to France. The 45-year old’s prominent use of social media as a campaign tool is another oft-cited similarity with Trump.

But for a new electoral measure, the field of candidates in Senegal could have been much larger. The measure requires candidates to secure signatures from at least 0.8% of the electorate, spread across seven of the country’s 14 regions. Only five of the 87 candidates who signaled an interest in running met the requirement, which is explained as a move to ensure only serious, viable candidacies.

In contrast, Nigeria’s elections will see over 70 candidates on the ballot, even though only two—president Muhammadu Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP)—have a realistic shot at winning. In fact, Nigerian presidential candidates are dropping out just ahead of the election and pledging support to one of the front-runners.

Senegal’s president-elect will be required to win over 50% of votes to secure victory in the first round of the polls. In the event that none of the contenders garner enough votes, the top two will contest a run-off.",There’s another African election this weekend few people are talking about,Qz.com,https://qz.com/africa/1557181/senegal-presidential-election-overshadowed-by-nigeria-polls/

Bernie Sanders is still the subject of grousing by former members of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign staff, and not only for his use of private planes. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Elections Ex-Clinton staffers slam Sanders over private jet flights The Vermont senator’s 2016 travel as a Clinton surrogate became ‘a running joke in the office.’

In his campaign launch video last week, Bernie Sanders singled out the fossil fuel industry for criticism, listing it among the special interests he planned to take on. But in the final months of the 2016 campaign, Sanders repeatedly requested and received the use of a carbon-spewing private jet for himself and his traveling staff when he served as a surrogate campaigner for Hillary Clinton.

In the two years following the presidential election, Sanders continued his frequent private jet travel, spending at least $342,000 on the flights.

Story Continued Below

Increased scrutiny of his travel practices, which are at odds with his positions on wealth inequality and climate change, are among the challenges Sanders will face as he makes his second White House run.

But he also faces another hurdle: hard feelings that remain to this day after the contentious 2016 Democratic primary. Many in the party continue to believe the Vermont senator played a role in contributing to Clinton’s defeat in November because of his criticisms of her prior to the general election, and his refusal to concede earlier when it appeared he had little mathematical chance of securing the party nomination.

And they are eager to point out Sanders’ flaws and examples of what they perceive to be examples of hypocrisy now that the one-time underdog rates as one of the front-runners in the crowded Democratic field.

“I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” said Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign.

In 2016, after Sanders endorsed Clinton and agreed to campaign on her behalf, the Sanders campaign’s preferred mode of travel quickly emerged as a point of tension, according to six former Clinton campaign staffers and another source familiar with the travel.

Those who had worked on his primary campaign made it known that the only logistical way Sanders could adhere to the event schedules requested by the Clinton campaign was by flying private. The Clinton campaign, however, viewed the private jet flights as a needless extravagance and wanted the senator to mostly fly commercial.

The senator ended up flying private on three separate multi-day trips in the last two months of the campaign.

Sanders’ flights — usually on a Gulfstream plane — cost the Clinton-Kaine campaign at least $100,000 in total, according to three people familiar with the cost of the air travel.

“We would try to fight it as much as possible because of cost and availability of planes, but they would request [a jet] every time,” one of those sources said. “We would always try to push for commercial. ... At the campaign, you’re constantly trying to save like 25 cents.”

Prior to working out the logistics of Sanders’ travel, “our working assumption was that 90 percent of the time it would be commercial,” said another person familiar with the matter. “If he was trying to hop from city to city in a particular state and [commercial] didn’t work, we were open to” chartering a plane.

But that idea did not go over well with the Sanders camp, according to this person.

“At that time, getting him on board — no pun intended —and his followers engaged for her, was a big priority,” said one former Clinton staffer, who explained that campaign leadership, including campaign manager Robby Mook, decided it was something Sanders wouldn’t budge on, so the campaign approved the requests to keep peace with the senator.

“We needed all hands on deck, including Bernie, and we were grateful for his support and the generous amount of time he gave the campaign,” Mook told POLITICO when asked for comment.

Sanders spokesperson Arianna Jones said it was physically impossible to get to all of the event locations in such a short period of time without chartered flights, especially since the senator was traveling to many smaller markets with limited commercial air travel options.

“That’s why chartered flights were used: to make sure Sen. Sanders could get to as many locations as quickly as possible in the effort to help the Democratic ticket defeat Donald Trump,” she said. “Sen. Sanders campaigned so aggressively for Secretary Clinton, at such a grueling pace, it became a story unto itself, setting the model for how a former opponent can support a nominee in a general election.”

In the final three months before Election Day 2016, Sanders held 39 rallies in 13 states on behalf of Clinton’s campaign, according to Jones, including 17 events in 11 states in the last week alone. When he went to New Hampshire, which borders Sanders’ home state of Vermont, he did not use a private jet to get there.

Rania Batrice, who served as Sanders’ deputy campaign manager at the end of his 2016 campaign, said that Clinton’s campaign would send over a proposed campaigning schedule for Sanders before the two sides talked through logistics and “at no point did I ever say ‘he has to have a private plane for the sake of having a private plane.’”

“The requests for a charter only came after the schedules were put in front of us. If a less rigorous schedule were put in front of us, we wouldn’t have needed a charter and that would have been fine for everyone involved, including Bernie,” she said, later adding: “Bernie worked his ass off on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the campaign.”

Josh Orton, a Sanders aide, said, “The senator was proud to work tirelessly on behalf of Sec. Clinton, and we believe that we must put our past differences aside and unite to defeat Donald Trump.”

To the Clinton staff, however, the issue of the senator and the private jets became so cumbersome that it turned into “a running joke in the office,” said one former Clinton staffer.

The travel details weren’t the only point of tension with Sanders. At his rallies for Clinton, Sanders sometimes only wanted people who had endorsed him in the primaries to speak when he would appear, a request which frustrated the Clinton campaign, according to a former Clinton staffer and another person familiar with the matter.

“Sure you can have your supporters there, but you can’t exclude the congressman who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the city you are going to,” said the former staffer. “You’re campaigning for us. That was always a battle every single time.”

Batrice, who became a full-time DNC consultant for the general election, called that allegation “ridiculous” and said that the Clinton campaign actually blocked several people Sanders wanted from speaking at rallies that he was headlining, but she declined to name them.

Just as many former Clinton supporters and staffers continue to hold a grudge against the Vermont senator, many Sanders supporters still nurse grievances about the way the senator and his campaign were treated by the Clinton campaign and the party establishment, including the Democratic National Committee.

Michael Briggs, Sanders’ 2016 campaign spokesman who often traveled with Sanders on the private flights, said Clinton and her staff were “total ingrates” in light of the efforts the Vermont senator put in to try to help elect her in the general election.

“You can see why she’s one of the most disliked politicians in America. She’s not nice. Her people are not nice,” he said. “[Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.”

“It doesn’t make me feel good to feel this way but they’re some of the biggest assholes in American politics,” he added.

Private jet travel on the campaign trail is not uncommon — either for candidates like Clinton or a top surrogate tasked with stumping for them. Often it is the most efficient mode of transportation, particularly when events are in locations where commercial air travel options are limited.

One veteran Democratic operative who oversaw surrogates for past presidential campaigns said providing private planes is standard practice for the most important surrogate of a presidential campaign in the general election.

In addition to Sanders, the Clinton campaign footed the private plane bill on occasion for several top celebrities, among them Beyonce, Jay Z and Katy Perry. But as a rule, when political surrogates made requests for private jets, the campaign’s answer was no — except when it came to Sanders, said one former Clinton staffer.

The Clinton campaign itself spent a total of $15.9 million on jet charter company Executive Flightways in the 2016 campaign, according to a review of FEC records. That money was used to ferry Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, Sanders, major celebrities, and Clinton’s traveling press corps.

The revelation of Sanders’ penchant for private jet travel, both in 2016 and in the subsequent years, could surface as an issue for him since he often demands the U.S. do its part to fight global climate change — to which CO2 emissions from aviation is a contributor.

“Climate change is not only real, it is already doing irreparable harm all over this planet, including the United States of America,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation” last November. “What Congress has got to do is take Trump on, take the fossil fuel industry on, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, to energy efficiency and sustainable energies like solar and wind.”

But last year, when Sanders faced reelection but faced only token opposition, his Senate campaign committee spent $342,000 on Apollo Jets, a private jet service. That money was used primarily to pay for a nine-day, nine-state tour to support Democratic candidates across the country.

Sanders held 18 “large public events in those days,” said Jones. “A review of airline flight schedules shows that this tour itinerary simply could not have been completed with commercial flights — it required a charter.”

She noted that the tour was the only time last year when Sanders flew on a private jet and also said the campaign purchased carbon offsets to zero out the emissions produced on the trip. Cars were also used on the ground whenever possible to get him to his events. She said that Sanders also flew commercial last year to hold more than 45 major rallies and events in 18 different states.

But the previous year, in April 2017, Sanders went on another far-reaching trip where private air travel was a significant component. According to a former DNC official and another person familiar with the details, Sanders’ camp requested a private jet for the “Come Together and Fight Back” unity tour with DNC chairman Tom Perez and other DNC officers — which included stops in Maine, Kentucky, Florida, Texas, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. The DNC paid Apollo Jets $157,000 that month, according to FEC records.

The next month, Sanders’ political committee transferred $100,000 to the DNC to share some, but not all, of the costs of the entire tour, which encompassed both the plane rides and other costs associated with the trips.

Asked whether Sanders will fly private for his 2020 campaign, Sanders spokesperson Jones said he “will be flying commercial whenever possible. The campaign will consider the use of charter flights based on a variety of factors, including security requirements, logistics, and media interest in traveling with the senator.”

Gov. Fairfax compares sexual assault allegations to lynching CNN Embattled Virg…,"Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who has been accused of rape and faces a House inquiry, described himself Sunday as a victim of a “political lynching.”

Mr. Fairfax, who is black, defended his reputation and cautioned against snap judgments for political expediency in a surprise speech shortly before the state Senate adjourned for the year.

“If we go backwards in a rush to judgment, and we allow for political lynchings without any due process, any facts, any evidence being heard, then I think we do a disservice to this very body in which we all serve,” the Democrat said, according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Mr. Fairfax, who claims the sex with both of his accusers was consensual, also said, “the truth is on my side.”

Republican House Majority Leader C. Todd Gilbert said Fairfax’s comments about lynchings were highly inappropriate.

“That is the worst, most disgusting type of rhetoric he could have invoked,” Mr. Gilbert told The Associated Press. “It’s entirely appropriate for him to talk about due process and we would intend to offer him every ounce of it, and he’s welcome to take advantage of that anytime he would like.”

Mr. Fairfax’s unexpected speech came two days after House Republicans announced plans for a public hearing to address the allegations.

Two separate allegations of rape, both from more than a decade ago, hit Mr. Fairfax as he became the heir apparent to Gov. Ralph Northam, who was being urged to resign because he wore blackface in the 1980s.

But until Friday, despite widespread calls for Mr. Fairfax also to resign, lawmakers from both parties had hesitated to start impeachment hearings or launch a committee probe.

Vanessa Tyson, a college professor, first came forward with an allegation that Mr. Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him when they met as campaign aides at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.

Meredith Watson then told her story of a similar attack by Mr. Fairfax in 2000 when they were students at Duke University.

The rape allegations added to a whirlwind of controversy for Virginia’s top elected Democrats.

Mr. Northam and Attorney General Mark Harris are both accused of racism after both admitted wearing blackface in the 1980s.

The governor and lieutenant governor bucked widespread calls to resign, including from members of their own party and most Democratic presidential candidates.

The rape accusations against Mr. Fairfax, however, have ramifications beyond his political career. He potentially faces criminal charges and, if convicted, up to 20 or 25 years in prison in Massachusetts and North Carolina, respectively.

Washington Examiner Former senior national security officials to rebuke Trump's national emergency declaration CNN Sen. Graham makes predictions on what will happen with the resolution to block Trump's emer…,"It's become a common talking point for ""Never Trump"" Republicans seeking to defeat President Trump in the 2020 GOP primaries: Polls have found that a substantial number, maybe 40 percent, of Republican voters say they would be open to a primary challenge to the president. Those surveys, the ""Never Trumpers"" argue, show that Trump is particularly weak and vulnerable to a serious primary challenge.

The problem is that it is common for voters to say they are open to a primary challenge to the president of their own party. It happened to former President Barack Obama in 2010-2011, before Obama went on to win re-election. It also happened to Bill Clinton in 1994-1995, before Clinton went on to win re-election. It did not happen to George W. Bush in 2002-2003, but that was because of strong Republican support for a wartime president.

In other words, today's poll results about President Trump are not at all unusual.

Talk about a primary challenge to Obama intensified around the 2010 midterms, when Democrats lost 63 seats in the House in an election Obama conceded was a ""shellacking."" The idea that Obama might face a challenge had been around since his divisive 2008 primary battle with Hillary Clinton. Democratic strategist Ed Kilgore wrote in the New Republic that by 2010 those tensions had ""gotten worse with the rise of the 'angry left,' which thinks Obama has been too eager to compromise with Wall Street and Republicans, and considers itself the representative of the Democratic base.""

With midterm campaigning looking bad for Democrats, polls indicated voter openness to an Obama challenge. In a September 2010 Gallup survey, 37 percent of Democrats said they would support a Hillary Clinton primary challenge to Obama, while 52 percent said they would support Obama, and 10 percent were undecided.

In late October 2010, an Associated Press poll found that 47 percent of Democrats said Obama ""should be challenged"" in a party primary. That included 29 percent of Democrats who said they originally supported Obama in the 2008 primary battle.

In late November 2010, after the midterm loss, a Marist poll asked, ""Do you want another Democrat to challenge Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2012 primaries?"" Forty-one percent of Democrats said yes, 45 percent when Democratic-leaning independents were included.

That same month, November, a Pew poll found that 38 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners would like to see an Obama challenge.

In January 2011, an AP-GfK poll found that 44 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would ""like to see Barack Obama face a serious challenge in the 2012 presidential primaries from another Democratic candidate.""

The specter of a primary challenge was much discussed among Democrats in those months, with prominent commentators anxious to knock it down and defend the president. ""One thing we know is, if you have a primary challenge, it is almost lethal to the incumbent,"" MSNBC's Chris Matthews said in December 2010.

By August 2011, Pew reported that the percentage of Democrats who wanted to see Obama challenged had fallen a bit, from 38 percent to 32 percent. But that lower number was still one-third of the Democratic electorate. Despite that, Obama avoided a primary challenge and went on to win re-election.

Things looked even worse for President Bill Clinton. After losing 54 House and eight Senate seats in the 1994 midterm elections, many Democrats were open to a primary challenge. In a December 1994 Times-Mirror poll, 66 percent of Democrats said they ""would like to see"" a primary challenge. By anybody's reckoning, 66 percent is a big number.

Potential opponents smelled opportunity. ""I think that people are going to look at the president in the next six to eight months, and they are going to make an assessment as to whether they believe that he can do the job,"" New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, a possible Clinton challenger, said in January 1995.

Clinton recognized the threat. ""From the time [Clinton aide Harold Ickes] arrived at the White House at the beginning of [1994, he] was primarily concerned with avoiding a primary challenge,"" the Washington Post reported in December 1995. ""Mr. Clinton, through prodigious fund raising and behind-the-scenes courting of the party base, had escaped a primary challenge,"" the paper reported in November 1996, after Clinton won re-election.

The president between Clinton and Obama, George W. Bush, did not face a primary challenge because of the special circumstances of his first term — the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq. Although many Democrats came to oppose the war by the 2004 election, Republicans were solidly with the president after the Iraq invasion in March 2003. Asked in a 2013 oral history project whether the Bush team worried about a primary challenge, campaign manager Ken Mehlman said, ""We didn't think, if you looked at where the country was, and particularly where the right side of the electorate was in 2002 — I did not think that was a real risk.""

Fast forward to today, after Republicans lost 41 House seats in the midterm elections. It is simply not surprising that some Republican voters would express an openness to see the president of their party, in this case Donald Trump, face a primary challenge. That's what voters do. On one hand, that reflects a measure of dissatisfaction with the president. On the other, it could be a peculiarity of polling; many people do not want to tell pollsters that their minds are closed so long before an election.

""At this early point in any campaign, people are not going to shut their minds,"" Republican pollster David Winston to me recently. ""They just don't do that. There's a huge difference between people saying they're thinking through things and how they behave. My guess is those polls are probably true, but that's because the electorate is trying to be thoughtful.""

It could be that, unlike Clinton, Bush, and Obama, Trump does end up facing a primary challenge. Such a challenge could be quite damaging, given that Presidents Ford, Carter, and Bush I all faced challenges and went on to lose the general election. Trump's 2016 margin of victory in some key states -- Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania -- was quite narrow, so a challenge need not be all that powerful to do significant harm.

But most of all, the primary talk serves to emphasize that polls often don't mean much. Back in 2010, in reporting the number of Democrats who were open to an Obama challenge, the Associated Press added this caution: ""Recent history shows presidents' early polling numbers mean little about their re-election prospects. At this stage two years before their re-elections, Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan had approval ratings that were lower than Obama's now, according to the Gallup Poll; both men won a second term. The ratings for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter were better than Obama's; both lost.""",Is Trump especially vulnerable to primary challenge? - Washington Examiner,Washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/is-trump-especially-vulnerable-to-primary-challenge

DRIVING THE DAY

THE ELECTION BOARD in North Carolina has ordered a new election in the 9th District, where Republican Mark Harris ran against Democrat Dan McCready in November. Raleigh News and Observer’s Brian Murphy, Jim Morrill and Ely Portillo

-- LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ: “It remains unclear if Harris will run again. On top of health concerns, local GOP strategists said the fraud allegations surrounding his campaign may make it harder for Harris for raise money.

“A number of other Republicans are eyeing the seat, including Matthew Ridenhour, an ex-Marine who recently served as a Mecklenburg County commissioner, and Kenny Smith, a former Charlotte city council member who ran and lost for the mayor of Charlotte.” POLITICO

OUR QUESTION: THIS IS AN R+8 seat. How much money will the two parties spend to win a seat that has absolutely no bearing on the control of power in Washington? Will outside groups get involved? Once one gets in, they all do, and this could become a multimillion-dollar endeavor.

PAGING THE NRCC … DES MOINES REGISTER: “Steve King: ‘I have nothing to apologize for,’ plans to run for re-election,” by Tony Leys: “A defiant Rep. Steve King confirmed Thursday that he will run for a 10th term as an Iowa congressman, despite controversies over his history of caustic remarks, including about race and immigration.

“The Kiron Republican has been criticized by national and state leaders of his own party, has been stripped of committee assignments in Congress and has drawn three primary challengers for the 2020 race.

“In a Thursday taping of Iowa Public Television’s ‘Iowa Press’ program, host David Yepsen asked him: ‘Are you sorry for anything that you’ve said?’ The congressman replied: ‘I have nothing to apologize for, Dave.’

“King confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination. He offered a message to voters in his northwest Iowa district: ‘Don’t let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who’s going to represent you in the United States Congress.’” Des Moines Register … 1:51 video

WITH THE GOVERNORS COMING TO TOWN … ALEX ISENSTADT: “Hogan rips RNC for shielding Trump from primary challenge”: “Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said Thursday he expects to make a springtime trip to New Hampshire as he weighs a 2020 challenge to Donald Trump — and accused the [RNC] of going to extraordinary lengths to shield the president from a potentially draining primary.

“‘Typically they try to be fair arbiters of a process and I’ve never seen anything like it and I’ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life. It’s unprecedented. And in my opinion it’s not the way we should be going about our politics,’ Hogan, a popular two-term Maryland governor, said in an interview with POLITICO. ‘It’s very undemocratic and to say, “We’re in some cases not going to allow a debate, we may not have a primary…”

“‘And the question is, what are they afraid of?’ he added. ‘Because on the one hand you look at polls, 70 percent of Republicans support the president in a primary. Why are they so concerned? Why the puffing out the chest — ‘We’ve put together the greatest team ever assembled, we’re going to raise all this money early, we’re going to hire all these people early, we’re going to take over the RNC…’” POLITICO

TALKER … ELIANA JOHNSON: “The North Korea summit nobody wanted: President Trump is excited to meet Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. Others fear he’ll give too much away”: “Many, including several of the president’s top advisers, are less excited. Some have expressed trepidation not only that the summit, scheduled to take place next week in Hanoi, may not yield big results. They worry, too, that Trump, eager to declare victory on the world stage, could make big concessions in exchange for empty promises of denuclearization. …

“Inside the administration, concern about the upcoming summit has come from predictable skeptics, including national security adviser John Bolton, a longtime opponent of diplomacy with North Korea, but also from unexpected corners. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the man charged with leading the negotiations, has expressed frustration to allies about the lack of diplomatic progress and voiced concern that his boss will get outmaneuvered, according to a source with direct knowledge of the conversations.” POLITICO

“But when delegates vote to elect the party’s next chair this weekend, they’ll weigh pitches from two front-running candidates with very different views about just how to put Republicans on the offensive again in a blue state that’s a reliable cash machine for Democrats.

“Jessica Patterson, chief executive of California Trailblazers, a group that trains Republican legislative candidates, has said her long-standing rapport with top-dollar donors will help move the party forward.

“But Travis Allen, the hard-charging former gubernatorial candidate running against her, has decried ‘special-interest billionaires’ who fund the party and says he wants to instead fill its coffers with an unprecedented grass-roots fundraising effort that would ask thousands of ‘ordinary California Republicans’ to make small monthly contributions.” LAT

GABBY ORR: “Pence takes Trumpism abroad”: “Vice President Mike Pence has slowly become of the president’s most visible overseas surrogates — sent to deliver Trump’s ‘America First’ demands.

“On Monday, Pence will make his third speech on foreign soil in the last two weeks when he travels to Bogota, Colombia, to call on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to step aside, a high-profile address that will come as the world watches to see whether Maduro relents on a blockade that has kept humanitarian aid packages from Venezuelans facing food and medicine shortages.

“The request will come just days after Pence took a swing through Europe, where he broadsided allies with an unexpected demand that they pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal, while chiding them for continuing to do business with the country. Pence pointedly reiterated the dictates in a second speech, even after being issued a flat denial the first time around.

“On the foreign stage, White House officials say Pence has sometimes settled into a role as the administration’s bad cop, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is the diplomat who sticks around to hash out particulars and the president is the showman who swoops in from time to time. And it’s a role Pence will likely continue to play in the next few months, as Trump’s schedule becomes increasingly campaign-focused.” POLITICO

TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION POLICY -- “Trump administration begins effort to strip work permits for immigrant spouses,” by San Francisco Chronicle’s Tal Kopan: “After nearly two years of delays, the Trump administration is moving ahead with its plan to stop granting work permits to the spouses of many high-skilled visa holders, an effort that could jeopardize tens of thousands of immigrant families in California alone.

“Rolling back the permits could have sweeping consequences for the Bay Area, where tech companies heavily rely on high-skilled immigrants. Many of those workers come to the U.S. with spouses and children, and the loss of the spousal work permits could imperil families’ ability to stay in the country or deter workers from accepting jobs here to begin with.” San Francisco Chronicle

“Under Jackson’s new order, Stone can’t make any public comments of any kind about the charges he’s facing from the special counsel, which include lying to Congress and witness tampering. He’s also banned from social media posts or speaking through surrogates about his case.” POLITICO

While the decision marks a victory for crime victims, the federal judge, Kenneth A. Marra, stopped short of overturning Epstein’s plea deal, or issuing an order resolving the case.

Size apparently does matter, at least when it comes to tax refunds, and that’s put Republicans on the defensive as Americans start filing their returns.

With headlines blaring about smaller refunds in the first weeks of the three-month filing season, GOP lawmakers and their supporters are working in tandem to remind people that the GOP tax overhaul cut almost everyone’s taxes last year, regardless of what their tax refunds look like this year.

Story Continued Below

But Americans are accustomed to refunds, often big ones, and IRS statistics showing they are down by an average of 17 percent so far this year have forced a reckoning that conservatives didn’t expect. Democrats are doing their best to take advantage of it and ramping up their criticism of the tax overhaul, which passed without a single Democratic vote.

The Treasury Department has taken pains to note the numbers are early, coming just a few weeks after filing officially started Jan. 28.

“As we have noted, data this early in the filing season has many aberrations and isn’t useful in drawing broad conclusions on refunds overall,"" a Treasury Department spokesperson said when the latest batch was released Friday night. ""There are many factors that impact refunds on a weekly basis that will normalize over time and lead to useful conclusions.""

But Democrats think they have the upper hand for now. “In politics, if you’re explaining you’re losing,” said one Democratic aide, who asked to remain anonymous to freely discuss internal party strategy.

Republicans are acutely aware that there's a public relations problem.

A Feb. 11 tweet from 2020 presidential aspirant Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), charging that the refund decline resulted from a middle-class tax hike under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, drew more attention to the issue, prompting strong Republican pushback.

GOP tax consultant Ryan Ellis, in a Washington Examiner opinion piece, called Harris’s tweet “an absurd, bad faith statement” and said “a tax refund’s size has nothing to [do] with whether or not one’s tax liability went up or down.” The middle class “were the big winners from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” he wrote.

The piece quickly made the rounds among Capitol Hill Republicans and their policy advocates, Ellis said. That sparked an effort to launch similar responses as Ellis and others, including media fact-checkers, debunked Harris’s claim.

A crowd-sourcing effort got under way rather than a series of formal meetings for conservatives to coordinate, though Ellis recently did a presentation on the issue at Americans for Tax Reform, led by high-profile tax critic Grover Norquist, where Ellis worked for years.

Republicans are being forced to grapple with Democrats’ general narrative that the Trump administration willfully lowered 2018 paycheck withholding to boost take-home pay — and Republican election prospects last November — resulting in smaller refunds this year.

“Republicans deliberately made a decision to goose the tax bill so they could get credit in the fall of 2018 and in effect saying it’s a long time until the spring of 2019 and maybe everybody would forget,” said Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). “I’m not forgetting.”

Sage Eastman of Mehlman Castagnetti, a former longtime Republican aide on the Ways and Means Committee, said, “People were voting in 2018, so you party with bigger paychecks in 2018 and risk the hangover in 2019 and hope it wears off before 2020.”

If that was actually the case, Republicans were playing with political fire. Some 70 percent of taxpayers typically get refunds, averaging about $3,000. Plenty of them plan around that, to pay bills or buy that flat-screen TV they’ve been wanting. Others view it as sort of a savings account.

As the smaller-refund narrative took hold in the media, Republicans started giving lessons in accounting.

Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and House Ways and Means ranking member Kevin Brady (R-Texas), both of whom played prominent roles in drafting the 2017 tax law, penned a joint op-ed to explain that smaller tax refunds don’t represent tax liabilities. Refunds result from overpayments.

“The size of your tax refund has nothing to do with your overall tax bill,” they wrote in USA Today on Wednesday. “It merely reflects what you overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year.”

A clearly frustrated Grassley was more blunt to a group of reporters earlier.

“Isn’t it kind of stupid to look at a refund, what your refund is?” he said.

Many tax professionals see paying more taxes than you need to in hopes of a big refund as akin to giving an interest-free loan to the government.

A senior Treasury official dispensed financial planning advice to reporters on a conference call after the second straight week of lower-than-average refunds. No tax preparer would advise clients to offer free loans, he said.

Supporters of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act stress that the IRS data are early. They say the agency’s statistics to date don’t fully reflect variables that could increase refunds as filing season wears on, such as payments connected to the earned income and child tax credits, the near-elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the impact of the partial federal government shutdown that ended just days before taxpayers could begin filing their tax returns.

Still, Andrew Moylan, executive vice president of the conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation, admitted the right could have better telegraphed changes in refunds likely to come from the new law.

“Anybody could Monday morning quarterback the TCJA and messaging around it after the fact and probably figure out some ways that could have been done better,” Moylan said. “But I do think that there are some market fundamentals, so to speak, that were going to be difficult regardless.”

It’s a dynamic true of any policy reform or overhaul, he said.

But Ellis expects it to be much ado about nothing by the time tax filing season ends in April. He and Moylan both predicted a new deduction for non-corporate business income would increase the size of tax refunds, as well as legislation to retroactively fix glitches in the tax law and extend a bloc of expired tax breaks, though it will take a good deal of time for those variables to show up in the data.

This week, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives expects to pass a bipartisan bill that would require federal background checks on all firearms sales, including gun-show and other private-party transactions; it will also vote on a proposal to increase the number of allotted days for FBI background checks of prospective purchasers (something that might have prevented Dylann Roof from buying the gun he used to kill nine people at Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015).

Most Republicans in Congress still oppose both bills, because to them, any perceived incursion on a centuries-old constitutional provision designed to protect colonial-era militias against state-sanctioned dissolution amounts to modern-day apostasy. North Carolina congressman and perennial NRA water-carrier Richard Hudson has introduced his nationwide concealed-carry reciprocity bill as an amendment to the background-checks bill; if it were to pass, this would be roughly the equivalent of proposing to extinguish a fire by alternating between water and kerosene.

For the first time since 2011, however, it doesn't really matter what party leadership wants, thanks to a strong Democratic majority and a handful of Republicans who are willing to defect from conservative orthodoxy. The gun lobby's vise grip on the GOP agenda no longer prevents serious consideration of a common-sense policy for which more than 90 percent of Americans have expressed their support.

Neither measure will make it through the Republican-held Senate, where Mitch McConnell has completed his post-midterm-elections shift from ""straining to pass wildly unpopular legislation and confirm right-wing ideologues to the bench while turning a blind eye to the president's corruption and criminality"" back to ""cynical Obama-era obstructionism, but as willfully ignorant as ever."" Even so, House speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to champion this cause is an encouraging sign that this Congress does not intend to be as circumspect about addressing gun violence as its predecessors. Every bill McConnell blocks becomes another element of the Democratic pitch in 2020, because the party can point to it as evidence of exactly what it intends to do if voters entrust it with the Senate and the White House. It is difficult to pass anything of substance in a divided government; it is, however, a fine opportunity to make the case for why the next government shouldn't be a divided one.

In theory, this dynamic is as true for Republicans as it is for Democrats. In practice, it could be disastrous for the NRA and its cheerleaders in Washington, because the types of policies they oppose become more popular by the day: Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, progressive taxation schemes, and so on. As the unchecked gun-violence epidemic continues to claim American lives, the issue has become a top priority for fed-up voters who see it, as former congresswoman Gabby Giffords put it, as a ""devastating moral failure."" Even firearms-enthusiast types, with increasing frequency, are recognizing the folly of treating the Second Amendment as a suicide pact; a poll conducted after Parkland, for example, found that 97 percent of respondents in gun-owning households now favor universal background checks, too.

The NRA has spent millions of dollars on its efforts to entangle disinformation with fear-mongering, and its rhetoric will likely become even more extreme as it senses public opinion continue to shift in the other direction. What Nancy Pelosi and company know, though, is that all the scary Dana Loesch videos in the world won't matter if no one who will implement the gun lobby's agenda is in a position of power anymore.",House Democrats Are Finally Standing Up to the NRA.

As the Brexit crisis goes down to the wire, May said a so-called “meaningful vote” would not take place this week as expected. Parliament will still hold a series of Brexit votes on Wednesday, but May’s deal itself will not be on the table.

On her way to an EU-Middle East summit, May said she is close to bringing home changes to her agreement that would satisfy objections to it, but needed time for meetings with European leaders which meant it would not be ready this week.

“We won’t bring a meaningful vote to parliament this week but we will ensure that that happens by the 12th of March,” May told reporters on board her plane. “It is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on the 29th of March and that is what we are working to do.”

Opponents accuse her of deliberately running out the clock, so as to force parliament to choose between a deal it has already rejected or leaving the EU with no deal at all, which businesses say would destroy their supply chains.

Both May’s Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party are formally committed to exiting the EU in line with a 2016 referendum vote, but both parties are internally divided over how or even whether to do so.

CABINET SPLIT

Before May set off for Egypt, three members of her cabinet publicly split with government policy and said they would side with rebels and opposition parties to stop a no-deal Brexit.

Yvette Cooper, an opposition Labour lawmaker who has proposed a bill that would block a no-deal Brexit, said May’s “last minute announcement that she won’t put a deal to parliament this week, and is leaving it until just two weeks before Brexit day, is utterly shambolic and irresponsible.”

“She cannot just keep drifting and dithering like this or there is a real risk our whole country tumbles off a cliff edge into a chaotic no deal that no one is ready for and that would hit food prices, medicine supplies, manufacturing and security.”

Some lawmakers will seek to grab control of Brexit in Wednesday’s series of votes, though such attempts have previously been defeated as May sought more time to get a deal.

Senior Labour figures said that the main opposition party was moving closer to supporting another Brexit referendum and could do so as soon as early as this week.

Nine Labour lawmakers and three Conservatives quit their parties last week in the biggest shakeup of its kind in British politics for decades, raising the prospect of further defections from both parties.

The British parliament voted 432-202 against May’s deal in January, a defeat by the biggest margin in modern British history. May says she can still win support for it if EU leaders ease rules intended to ensure no hard land border ever appears between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland.

European Council President Donald Tusk told May that the EU needs clarity that whatever the bloc might offer would command a majority in the British parliament, before a summit of EU leaders scheduled for March 21-22, an EU official said.

EU officials have considered many theoretical scenarios, including an extension of Brexit for up to two years, though it is unclear if such a delay would resolve the current impasse.

The EU has ruled out reopening the withdrawal agreement. Both sides are looking at a possible legal addendum to reassure lawmakers who worry that the Irish border plans could keep Britain trapped in the EU’s orbit for years to come.

But Europeans sound increasingly frustrated at Britain’s political chaos: “You need two to dance tango, and I know how to dance,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said when asked if he was running out of things to give on Brexit. “I have a certain Brexit fatigue.”","Brexit must not be frustrated, UK PM Theresa May says",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-idUSKCN1QD08V

The Brexit vote must not be frustrated and the government needs to maintain an ""absolute"" focus on delivering it, Theresa May has said.

In a speech to Tory activists the PM said, as her negotiations with the EU reach their final stages, the ""worst thing we could do is lose our focus"".

It came as three pro-EU cabinet members warned they could vote to delay Brexit to prevent a ""disastrous"" no-deal.

But Mrs May said there must be no party ""purges"" over MPs with differing views.

Ahead of crucial votes in the Commons next week, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke told the Daily Mail they would be prepared to defy the prime minister and vote for a delay.

The intervention led to calls for their resignations by Tory Brexiteers.

The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March.

However, the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time.

Largest democratic exercise

Mrs May's speech to the National Conservative Convention in Oxford on Saturday evening came as MPs prepare for a series of votes on Wednesday which could see Parliament take control of the Brexit process.

Delegates at the convention overwhelmingly backed a symbolic motion saying Brexit should not be delayed, and leaving without an agreement should remain an option.

Mr Clark, the business secretary, along with Ms Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and the justice secretary, Mr Gauke, had earlier said they would be prepared to defy Mrs May and vote for a delay to Brexit.

They argued there ""simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation"" unless a deal is approved in the coming days.

An amendment tabled by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour's Yvette Cooper would give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal situation if there is no agreement with the EU by the middle of March.

But Mrs May told activists: ""Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute.

""We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country's history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus.""

Mrs May also said there should be no moves to deselect MPs because of their views on Brexit.

Broad church

The resignations of three pro-Remain Tory MPs - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - to join a group of Labour defectors in the new Independent Group reduced the Tories working majority in Parliament to eight.

Mrs May said: ""No-one gets more frustrated than I do when people vote against the whip, particularly given the tight Parliamentary arithmetic that we face.

""But we are not a party of purges and retribution. We called a referendum and let people express their views - so we should not be seeking to deselect any of our MPs because of their views on Brexit.

""Our party is rightly a broad church - on that and other issues.""

It could all get worse with a huge field and even higher stakes. Photo: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images

We’re now well under a year away from the Iowa caucuses, and an unusually — perhaps uniquely — large Democratic field is forming to compete for the opportunity to face Donald J. Trump in 2020. It is highly appropriate that before the festivities intensify, multiple voice are being raised to remember the wolf at the door before engaging in any intramural fisticuffs.

At the American Prospect, veteran labor political operative Steve Rosenthal offers four “rules” for 2020 Democrats in order to avoid a “circular firing squad” that helps Trump win the general election.

* Don’t try to stifle new ideas, new opinions, or new plans.

* Democrats need a robust debate on the issues instead of misleading or attack ads aimed at tearing each other down.

* Every Democratic candidate should sign a pledge that they will give their wholehearted support to whoever eventually wins the party’s.

Rosenthal’s fourth guideline he calls the “Two-For-One Rule:”

Last month, a friend of mine suggested that all the Democratic presidential candidates (and their supporters — that includes super PACs) refrain from being overly negative about the other Democratic candidates in the field. He said any time he feels tempted to say or write something bad about one of the candidates, he would precede it with two positive things.

In the same vein, progressive economist Jared Bernstein in a Washington Post op-ed suggested that 2020 Democrats (and presumably the media) constantly keep in mind that on policy issues “you would need a high-powered electron microscope to see the difference among the Democrats, compared with the difference between them and the Republicans.” And his big “rule,” borrowed from another Democratic veteran, Ron Klain, is even simpler than Rosenthal’s:

A debate about ideas is healthy, a debate about motives is not. The Democrats should hash out their differences in 2020 without slashing up one another — not casting aspersions on each other’s integrity, motivation or intentions. It is that latter path that creates an opening for Trump’s reelection in 2020.

Both these pleas (and others like it) are based on a common understanding of several unique things about the 2020 race:

1. The stakes of a general election win could not be much higher. Horrible as having Trump as the 45th president has been, a second term would be potentially catastrophic for progressives. The impact on the Supreme Court alone could be seismic. The battle against climate change could be lost for good. The odds of a stupid war or a global economic meltdown would go way up. And a second loss to Trump would be so discouraging to progressive voters that the Democratic Party’s very future might be endangered. Some activists and operatives think it’s critical the ideological direction of the Democratic Party be decisively turned in one direction or another in 2020. Important as a “struggle for the soul of the party” may be, it cannot possibly be as important as denying Trump’s reelection.

2. Trump and his media allies will ruthlessly take advantage of any Democratic divisions or exposed candidate weaknesses. There has never been a president or presidential nominee swifter than Trump in weaponizing conflicts in the opposing party, and he fully understands it’s the only way he can win, as Michael Tomasky points out in a rueful reflection on how the 2016 Democratic primaries played a big role in Trump’s win:

The only way Trump can win is by convincing millions of people that the Democrat is just unacceptable under any circumstances. This will involve a campaign of horrendous lies and smears against whoever is the nominee. He will catch the scent of that nominee’s weakness, and he will hammer at it and hammer at it, hoping to scare tremulous and confused voters into voting for him.

Given that reality, there is really only one terrible and unforgivable thing the Democratic contenders can do to one another, and that is to use the primary season to expose that Achilles Heel and worsen it. This is what Sanders did with respect to Clinton in 2016. By calling her corrupt and in hock to Wall Street, he set up Trump’s “Crooked Hillary” line of attack.

This isn’t just about Sanders, to be clear. There’s no question that had Bernie won the nomination, Clinton’s criticisms of him as an extremist would have instantly made their way into Trump’s campaign rhetoric.

3. The sheer size of the 2020 Democratic field will make personal attacks and exaggeration of issue differences unusually tempting. A candidate staring at a five-point deficit and an empty campaign treasury before a key, must-win primary would likely considering selling off their children for a well-timed day of media dominance, and unfortunately nothing works quite like a negative attack, whether it’s personal or ideological. But 2020 may be exactly the wrong year to assume Democrats can laugh off conflicts and kiss and make up after the primaries are over (if, indeed, the primaries even produce a clear winner). The only way to head off this dynamic is if other candidates along with party leaders and activists come down like the wrath of God on any candidate that succumbs to the temptation of straying over the line into attacks on a rival’s character or motives, or forgets to remind listeners that any differences on issues are laughably small when compared to the terrifying agenda of the GOP.

4. It’s not enough for candidates to play nice with each other: They need to rebuke supporters who don’t and won’t. Anyone with the least understanding of social media knows that it won’t cut any ice if presidential candidates stay above-board while their most passionate supporters go after opponents with a tire iron — a tool that will be happily picked up by Team Trump the minute it’s discarded. Of course politicians can’t control everything their fans say and do. But public criticism may usefully shame the worst offenders into some self-control. Tomasky addresses a personal plea to Bernie Sanders:

[I]ntensity leads many of his backers to the Bernie or Bust view of things. And it’s incumbent upon him to say to them, “No, let’s not have that again; of course I want the nomination, but if the voters decide otherwise, they decide otherwise, and the important thing is to stay together and not hand Trump ammunition.”

Again, Sanders is not the only candidate whose supporters may go over the line. They should all preemptively demand a certain degree of civility, and agree in advance to accept defeat quickly if and when it happens. The Clinton-Sanders mutual grievances are still infecting intra-Democratic discourse to this day; another round of similar recriminations in 2020 could be even more harmful.

Soon we will be into the heat of the nomination race, and making up rules for civility on the fly won’t be practicable. It would be smart for Democrats right now to make sure that on November 4, 2020, they aren’t looking down the barrel of an eight-year Trump presidency and wondering how their party blew it again.",Will 2020 Democrats Help Trump By Destroying Each Other?,New York Magazine,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/will-2020-democrats-help-trump-by-destroying-each-other.html

Read Full Article at RT.com","Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has refused to recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s ‘interim president,’ calling instead for new elections. His comments have enraged Democratic lawmakers who are pushing for regime change.

Sanders is widely seen as a top contender to take on Donald Trump in 2020, but his views on the current political crisis in Venezuela have put him at odds with the Democratic Party.

In an interview with Univision, the senator – an independent who identifies as a democratic socialist – was asked if he considers self-declared interim president Juan Guaido to be the legitimate leader of Venezuela.

“No. I think what has to happen right now – I think there are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election, and I think the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela,” Sanders responded.

While he stressed the need for international cooperation in resolving the standoff between Guaido and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Sanders said that the United States “must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America… whether it was Chile or Brazil or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.”

The interview ruffled the feathers of Democratic lawmakers in Florida, who have adopted a hardline stance on Venezuela in order to appeal to the state’s politically active community of anti-Maduro Venezuelan-Americans.

“He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,” Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles, told Politico.

The outlet also cited a statement released by the Florida Democratic Party, which said unequivocally that the group recognizes Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader.

Guaido declared himself “interim president” in January, a move that was quickly backed by Washington and a number of its Western allies.

In recent weeks, thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in Caracas – both for and against Maduro. However, the Venezuelan military has stood by the current government, leaving many to speculate that the US-backed usurpation attempt has already fizzled out.

It’s 2019, and the Democratic Party is finally starting to energize voters. Gone are calls for cutting Social Security or one-upping Republicans in games of tax-cutting or warmongering. In their place are transformational ideas like Medicare for All, universal childcare, and a Green New Deal. Democratic candidates and elected officials are finally hearing the needs and wishes of their supporters, and acting accordingly. Ad Policy

Now it’s time for those of us in the consulting field, who work to help elect these leaders, to follow suit.

While it’s not well-known outside the political class, many consultants who advise campaigns are often working for corporate clients at the same time—and all too frequently, these clients interests’ directly oppose the goals of any progressive coalition. Those working both sides of the street include some of the most senior aides from the Obama administration, and as well as advisers to both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. From opposing progressive taxation to fighting for deregulation, working for corporate clients means pushing an agenda most progressives would consider a non-starter were it espoused by a political candidate.

Many progressives recently criticized Bill Burton, a top Democratic consultant and former Obama aide, for working on former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s independent presidential bid. Critics rightly worried that by helping Schultz direct massive resources against the Democratic nominee, Burton could swing the election over to Donald Trump. Besides, Schultz’s agenda of opposing higher taxes on multimillionaires or Medicare for All is a direct attack on the progressive movement.

However, to criticize Burton for working for Schultz while giving him and his previous firm, SKDK, a pass for advising and advancing corporate clients misses the larger picture. Why was it OK to push a conservative agenda for a corporation, but suddenly verboten to do so for a candidate? In both instances, the Democratic Party’s top talent is working to undermine the party’s progressive agenda. We can all do better.

Obviously, consultants have a right to make a living—and like the rest of America, there are consultants struggling with debt, housing costs, and medical expenses. I am also aware that some of us are more fortunate than others, and better positioned to make the difficult choices of choosing which clients to accept. I certainly don’t take for granted my own privilege, or consider myself perfect or blameless.

I’m not writing this to condemn my colleagues or point the finger. What I am doing is stating a goal for myself that I hope others will consider. Let’s change the way we do business, and agree from now on that working for corporations should no longer be business as usual for Democratic consultants. Current Issue View our current issue

Now, this may sound like a page out of Jerry Maguire’s mission statement: “The things we think but do not say.” But the fact is, these aren’t normal times. Solutions daring enough to solve the problems we face, like a Green New Deal, aren’t necessarily going to be “business-friendly,” and may not be endorsed by corporate America. Some consultants may—consciously or unconsciously—advise their candidates to take a softer stance on an issue because they can “see it from the business side of things.” How can we do that and even pretend to fight for the party’s bedrock principles of economic fairness, racial justice, environmental protection, and affordable health care for all?

“Consultant” is a vague label, but the truth is that many of us on the Democratic side are veteran campaign and government staffers who wanted to settle down and raise our families. We are some of the most experienced operatives in the Democratic Party, which is all the more reason that we need to change the way we do business.

If we really are the ones with the most experience in helping Democrats win, let’s use that experience to ensure that progressive Democrats win. Because for the next two years, there is nothing more important than promoting a progressive agenda, electing Democrats, and stopping Donald Trump.

I’ve been working in politics for over 20 years, on campaigns as well as in government. I’m proud of this work. But along every stop of my career, both in government and as a political adviser, the problems with the Democratic Party establishment have come into clearer focus: The establishment wants candidates who will support policies that preserve the status quo. For those of us who want progressive policies that are in fact overwhelmingly popular but stand in opposition to the status quo, it’s vital that we work for causes and candidates who are untethered to that establishment. There are progressive candidates at every level of government—from school board to president. We haven’t been invested in finding and electing them, but have found ourselves working for the established interests of corporations and the party.

For decades now, Democrats have been apologizing for our beliefs. We’ve bent over backward to and accommodate a Republican Party that has no interest in compromise, and we have settled for incremental gains instead of real victories. It’s time for progressives to be smarter, fight harder, and win on our own terms.

After all, if we want Democratic candidates to answer directly to the people they serve, we need to make sure that those advising them do the same. Let’s all get on the same program, and fight to reclaim the promise of this country for those who need it most.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have both publicly supported reparations for black people, a stance that previous Democratic presidential candidates have not taken, according to The New York Times.

Harris expressed her support for reparations during an interview on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show, a nationally-syndicated program with a large black audience.

She later told the Times that America has to ""be honest that people in this country to not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities.""

""I'm serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities,"" Harris said.

Warren called for the U.S. to ""confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations.""

Neither Warren nor Harris have gotten into the details of how such a program would work. Like other Democratic initiatives such as Medicare for All, reparations would likely cost trillions of dollars.

The support for reparations is another example of the leftward shift of the party even in the past few years. Former President Barack Obama did not support reparations, nor did Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016.

Hot Air's Allahpundit noted that Warren's support of reparations for black Americans might raise questions about whether she supports a similar measure for Native Americans:

""I assume she also supports reparations for Native Americans. If you think her Cherokee DNA test was a backfire, imagine her having to explain to various tribes why the persecution and ethnic cleansing they experienced doesn't quite cut it for compensatory purposes.""



With two prominent Democratic candidates coming out in favor of reparations, it's likely that the other Democratic presidential hopefuls will be asked to take a stance on the issue in coming weeks as well, as they seek to gain an edge with black voters.","Warren, Harris publicly support reparations for blacks impacted by slavery and discrimination",Theblaze.com,https://www.theblaze.com/harris-warren-publicly-support-reparations-for-blacks-impacted-by-slavery-and-discrimination

STANFORD – With the first debate between Democratic candidates just four months away, the 2020 US presidential campaign is off to an early start. This election will be hugely consequential for the United States, its allies and adversaries, its trading partners, and the global economy. US policy on trade, energy, corporate taxation, debt, defense, climate change, and more is on the line.

It is far too early to predict the eventual Democratic nominee, let alone whether he or she will win the presidency in 2020. But with 12 candidates already in the race, Democrats clearly believe that President Donald Trump is extremely vulnerable (his job-approval rating currently hovers around 44%). An early take on the Democratic field is therefore in order.

Attention so far has focused on the senators: Kamala Harris (California), Cory Booker (New Jersey), Kirsten Gillibrand (New York), Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), and Bernie Sanders (Vermont). Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to join the race; in early polling, he runs first, and Sanders second. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, Senator Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and media sensation Beto O’Rourke may also run.

The current Democratic candidates fall into two camps. Those on the far left (Sanders, Warren, Harris, Booker, and Gillibrand) favor a huge expansion of government along Scandinavian democratic socialist lines. This entails higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and a government-run health-care system. They also support a radical restructuring of American energy under the so-called Green New Deal, which is being backed by new Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others. The initiative calls for retrofitting every building in the US for green efficiency, rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, and replacing much air travel with a national high-speed rail system. Also included is the left’s “social justice” wish list of guaranteed jobs and vacations, and a basic income for those “unable or unwilling to work.”

By contrast, the likely center-left candidates – Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg, and Brown (if they run) – favor more incremental policy proposals, claiming that the country is willing to go only so far and can afford only so much. All will claim they can win the presidency with the support of undecided independents and moderate Republicans.

If history is any guide, candidates who are not incumbent presidents rarely waltz to their party’s nomination. Bill Clinton eventually won the 1992 Democratic nomination after recovering from potentially fatal setbacks early in his campaign. And on the Republican side, John McCain was down and almost out before roaring back to capture the 2008 nomination.

Some of the Democratic candidates for 2020 may also overcome inevitable early stumbles. These include Warren’s controversial DNA test that disproved her Native-American heritage, Booker saying that the world can’t continue eating meat because cow flatulence emits methane, and Harris planning to eliminate employer-provided health insurance, upon which most Americans now rely. One of these three may even record an upset and become president. Or they may secure the nomination, fizzle on the big stage, and fade to an historical footnote, like George McGovern, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis.

There is far less uncertainty among Republicans: barring a lightning strike, Trump will easily be renominated. Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld is a minor distraction, while former Ohio Governor John Kasich also is considering a challenge. Ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz may run as an independent, enraging Democrats who fear he would siphon off votes from their candidate.

The most important factor in the 2020 election will be the state of the economy, which is currently very strong, thanks in part to Trump’s tax reforms and his rollback of stifling Obama-era regulation, although only a fraction of voters give him credit for this. In addition, Trump can appeal to likely Republican voters by pointing to some of his other major first-term accomplishments. These include the start of military rebuilding, the appointment of two conservative Supreme Court justices, and new (albeit risky) approaches to North Korea and China.

The challenge for Trump in 2020 will be to persuade enough voters in the middle to give him another four years, despite their discomfort with some of his behavior. It remains to be seen whether Trump can tone down his tweeting to offend fewer potential voters and, as in his recent State of the Union address, reach for bipartisan compromise on important issues, as he recently did on major legislation to reform the criminal justice system.

Polls show that Democrats most value a candidate who can defeat Trump. Should Trump’s reelection prospects weaken, this could increase the likelihood of a far-left Democratic nominee with a radical agenda. But if Trump’s approval ratings improve, such a nominee could spell electoral disaster for the Democrats.

If the 2020 election is close, the result will hinge on a modest number of contested states, some of which are in the Midwest and are home to working-class voters who feel under assault from national Democrats. The Green New Deal will not go down well with Pennsylvania’s frackers, Ohio’s coal miners, and the region’s electricity consumers. Nor will the left’s cultural agenda.

As of now, the best thing going for the Democratic contenders, absent an economic downturn, is Trump’s behavior, whereas Trump’s best hope is the radical policy agenda of many Democratic candidates. If these trends continue, the 2020 presidential election could be as dramatic and unpredictable as the last one.",The Race to Challenge Trump,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-policies-by-michael-boskin-2019-02

Read Full Article at RT.com","Freshman congresswoman and political lightning rod Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is set to add another, more surprising title to her resume: comic book star.

Ocasio-Cortez will feature as a “butt-kicking” political superhero in a new comic book called ‘Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez And The Freshman Force,’ which is billed as “satire that takes aim at Washington” and that will “spare no one.”

The cover of the first issue “New Party, Who Dis?” – a reference to the jab Ocasio-Cortez made at her congressional colleague Joe Lieberman on Twitter – features the politician wielding a sword and wearing a Superwoman-style outfit in front of Capitol Hill.

Other artwork for the project, published by Devil’s Due, depicts the self-described Democratic Socialist with her smartphone in hand, wearing her signature white suit, hoop earrings and red lipstick.

Ocasio-Cortez – who has not actually endorsed the new venture featuring her likeness – amazed the comic book community recently, quoting Alan Moore’s graphic novel Watchmen in a tweet to her critics: “None of you understand. I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with ME.”

While Ocasio-Cortez is seen as somewhat of an outsider even by her own party, it looks like the comic book version of her life will mainly take aim at Republicans – and see the Democratic establishment get off the hook. Describing the comic in more detail, the publisher said it “satirically skewers everyone from President Trump to his near-endless team of morally-compromised Republican cronies.”

It’s not the first time political figures have become comic book heroes. Devil’s Due also turned former president Barack Obama into a comic book star in ‘Barack the Barbarian.’

The first issue of the Ocasio-Cortez-themed comic is set for release on May 15, in case you wanted to mark your calendars.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters in St. John’s, N.L., when asked about his conversations with then Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau’s remarks were among the most detailed yet to explain an affair that is harming his Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Trudeau denies a Feb. 7 report in the Globe and Mail that officials exerted undue pressure last year on Wilson-Raybould to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

SNC-Lavalin is a big employer in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats to have any chance of winning a majority in the election.

After Canada’s director of public prosecutions ruled on Sept. 4 that the trial should proceed, Trudeau and senior officials raised the matter three times with Wilson-Raybould, who had the power to overturn the decision.

Wilson-Raybould, who quit last month after being demoted to veterans affairs minister in January, has said nothing. She is due to address the House of Commons justice committee next week.

The Trans Mountain project took a step back into reality Friday with the National Energy Board approval that everyone expected.

But it’s still a cancelled pipeline after the disastrous Federal Court of Appeal decision of last Aug 30.

Trans Mountain will be legally extinct until the Trudeau cabinet re-approves it, ostensibly within the 90-day guideline for these decisions.

It’s absurd to imagine the cabinet failing to grant a new certificate, after spending $4.5 billion to buy the whole works from Kinder Morgan.

Cabinet rejection would combine with the SNC-Lavalin fiasco and likely drive the Liberals from office in the federal election this fall. No government can survive two spectacular regional fiascos in the same year.

Approval has to come at some point, obviously.

But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wounded cabinet have a very tricky choice here, and it’s all about election timing.

Under the worst scenario, the cabinet may just let the decision ride until after the election. That would push the construction reboot well into 2020.

The simplest and best solution would be to approve the pipeline by the end of May and get construction moving as quickly as possible.

There would be controversy on the coast, and more legal challenges, but at least the thing would be a fait accompli by federal voting day, likely in October.

The pipeline could well be a fading national issue by then. And the Liberals would win back approval among many westerners.

Premier Rachel Notley doesn’t expect approval within 90 days, but she sure wouldn’t object. Federal approval before her own election would be an NDP bonanza.

A quick approval would take courage and decisive leadership, though. The Liberals don’t show much of either these days.

For one thing, cabinet isn’t bound by this 90-day guideline for approving or rejecting an NEB approval. In fact, it’s usually ignored.

Notley points out that with both Northern Gateway and the first Trans Mountain approval, the gap between NEB approval and cabinet certificates was about six months.

Federal sources suggest there’s hope of getting this one done within the guideline. It’s less complicated because this is the second round and many details are already decided.

But the feds also won’t specifically promise to decide within 90 days because that would suggest there’s a cutoff date for Indigenous consultation.

That impression helped bring down the first approval. So they’re avoiding any hint of a deadline.

Notley is probably right, then — federal response to the NEB, and work on the First Nations engagement, could extend well beyond the 90-day period that began Friday.

She doesn’t see that as a threat to cabinet approval that would allow construction to start again by fall.

But then, she’s a self-professed optimist. You must be, to see the Liberals making a highly contentious decision that benefits Alberta with an election very close.

Trudeau’s federal caucus and cabinet are not entirely united on the pipeline. The more ardent climate-change activists don’t like it at all. From the moment the Liberals were elected in 2015, it was obvious that some key players don’t even like to talk about the project.

Related

That same crew (including Finance Minister Bill Morneau) were then forced to buy the project when Kinder Morgan threatened to pull out.

Having done that, and then swallowing the federal court rejection, can we really imagine the Liberals staking their electoral survival on the pipeline?

But they must. This is hugely important to a country that has already lost $100 billion in resource investment, according to the C.D. Howe Institute.

As another PM once said, roll the dice. Approval no later than June, construction starting in late summer.

Go ahead, Liberals. Amaze Alberta.

Two capital cities, two raging scandals.

In Ottawa, the SNC-Lavalin affair is producing steady eruptions of bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

And in Victoria, Speaker Darry Plecas keeps swinging his political wrecking ball in the shocking legislature spending scandal.

Both could get even wilder and crazier in the days ahead, with immediate impacts set to be felt in the crucial Burnaby South byelection.

Monday’s byelection battle pits federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh against Liberal candidate Richard Lee.

This one looked like a walk in the proverbial park for Singh after the Liberals’ original candidate, Karen Wang, was replaced for singling out Singh’s South Asian ethnicity in a social-media post.

The Liberals brought in an emergency pinch-hitter in Lee, a former provincial MLA who won four straight elections for the B.C. Liberals.

Ironically, the Wang affair may have actually helped the Liberals because Lee is arguably a better candidate.

But then things went berserk back in Ottawa, where Trudeau’s office was accused of pressuring former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a cushy plea-bargain deal to Montreal-based corporation SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal corruption charges.

The timing was perfect for Singh, who demanded a public inquiry.

“Canadians deserve to know if their government is working for them or for a massive corporation with deep ties to the Liberal party,” Singh said.

Will the SNC-Lavalin scandal help Singh beat his Liberal opponent on Monday? He’d better hope so.

If Singh loses — and the Liberals came awfully close to winning the riding less than four years ago — he will likely be forced out as NDP leader with a federal election looming in the fall.

Lee has tiptoed carefully around the SNC-Lavalin affair, avoiding direct comments while insisting he stands for clean, honest government.

“I believe in transparent, better politics,” Lee said.

On paper, Singh should finally win a seat in the House of Commons Monday. In reality, he is in tough, in a riding where he’s seen as an outsider from Ontario.

Ironically, many Liberals might be secretly hoping Singh wins the byelection and continues his uninspiring leadership of the NDP, which is trailing badly in national polls.

But, even if they still have Singh to kick around, the SNC-Lavalin affair is still damaging Trudeau.

The drama has unfolded in the worst possible way for the prime minister and his Liberal government: A daily drip-by-drip series of damaging revelations. And the worst could be yet to come.

Wilson-Raybould is now set to testify in front of the federal justice committee. Her appearance could come as early as Monday, at the same time Burnaby South voters are heading to the polls.

What will the former AG have to say? She has so far refused to comment, insisting her former role as the country’s top lawyer prevents her from speaking because of solicitor-client confidentiality.

She clearly wants to tell her story. Ottawa is awash in whispers that she already told cabinet colleagues that she was pushed to give SNC-Lavalin a get-out-of-jail-free card.

If Wilson-Raybould tells the committee this week that she was inappropriately pressured to let a Liberal-linked company off the hook on criminal charges, Trudeau’s troubles are going to deepen.

In Victoria, meanwhile, the Darryl Plecas Show continues to shake the people’s house to its foundations.

Last week, the Speaker released yet another report on the legislature spending scandal, insisting suspended officials Craig James and Gary Lenz took lavish “business” trips that were more like vacations.

A trip to study earthquake preparedness was really a whale-watching adventure, Plecas wrote, while a getaway to Seattle to review “emergency evacuation procedures” at Safeco Field turned into a group outing to a Seattle Mariners baseball game.

“What in fact appears to be the case is that their extensive ‘work’ travels served as their de facto holidays,” Plecas wrote.

The sour cherry on top of this rotten sundae for taxpayers? Plecas said James and Lenz routinely demanded cash payouts for their vacation time, insisting they didn’t take holidays.

Where does it all go from here? The all-party committee that “manages” your money at the legislature voted last week to bring in a retired judge to review the whole stinking mess.

Alan Mullen, the Speaker’s chief of staff, said he expects the former judge to review the findings in a matter of weeks rather than months.

Could that lead to James and Lenz being fired? The two men, who insist they have done nothing wrong and want their jobs back, are currently on paid leave.

“I don’t think the information contained in these reports is leadership,” Mullen said.

“I’m not a member of the house, so it would be inappropriate for me to say whether they should or should not be fired. But as a British Columbian, that’s not leadership.”

Plecas, meanwhile, has no plans to stop swinging his wrecking ball and will issue more reports on wrongdoing at the legislature.

Said Mullen: “We’ve got a job to do and British Columbians are screaming loud and clear, ‘Please don’t stop. Please keep going.’ Oh my goodness, are we going to keep going? That’s a big Yes.”

In this tale of two political cities, don’t expect the drama to end.

Ken Price, father of one of the injured victims, told the media on Friday that a group of families have sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The letter requests that the government addresses what they say is a lack of action to curb gun violence.

“Are we going to learn from our experience or are we going to express grief in the moment and move on? We are better than this as a nation,"" the open letter reads. ""We are urging that Canada follow the lead of other like-minded countries such as the UK, Japan and Australia and impose a ban on the private ownership of handguns and military style assault rifles.""

The gathering on Friday marked not only the seven month anniversary of the shooting but also the first time victims and their families rallied together publicly.

On July 22, gunman Faisal Hussain opened fire into crowded restaurants and patios killing 18-year-old Reese Fallon, and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis. Thirteen other people were injured. Investigators say the gunman later killed himself.

Price’s daughter Samantha was on Danforth Avenue eating ice cream with Fallon and a group of friends on the night of the shooting. A bullet pierced Price’s thigh.

Fallon's younger sister, Quinn Fallon, also spoke during the press conference at Danforth Music Hall and said her family now feels ""incomplete.""

""Reese always talked about her future — her future at McMaster [University], becoming a nurse and how many kids she wanted and where she wanted to raise a family,"" she said, adding the pain her family feels is “indescribable.”

""Because of this tragedy, Reese and Julianna will never get to experience a day past that July 22. They both wanted love and peace, not hate or violence,"" she said. Noor Samiei, a friend of Fallon, told CTV Toronto she could never accept Fallon’s death. “It’ll always affect me.”

""We miss Reese and we miss Julianna. We have to live with that,"" Samiei said at the press conference. ""But we don't have to live with the laws that could be changed to help prevent this from happening again.""

Price said “the shootings took the lives of two girls we miss very much,” Price said. “We’re grieving still, every family here still feels affected … however there are some of us who do want to stand up today and say we do need to change.”

He said Canadians have gone through an “unprecedented year” in gun violence, particularly in Toronto. He stressed this wasn’t a “referendum on firearms in general, but on specifically handguns and assault rifles.”

Price said the group was “unanimous” in asking elected officials at all levels of government to advocate for these changes. Several of the family members wore shirts which read “protect kids, not guns.”

'We don’t want this to be you'

“We want to see this country move in this direction. We think it will benefit the country and we think it will prioritize public safety,” Price said. “We don’t want this to be you in the future and we can improve our odds of that not being the case if you’re supportive now.”

On Friday, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said their investigation into the shooting had finished but he didn’t say when more information would be released.

Toronto’s city council has already called for a ban on handguns and assault rifles. Mayor John Tory previously sent a letter to the families of the Danforth shooting victims, and that he has also reached out to Trudeau.

The Liberal government is already exploring a potential handgun ban but affected families worry it won’t be enough.

""The families fear that the initiative will fall short of recommending a handgun and assault rifle ban, and they want to ensure they see action,"" the letter states.

Canada’s current firearms legislation doesn’t contain a definition of what constitutes as an assault rifle. But a recent federal government paper on new gun legislation took the definition from the United States Department of Justice, which states: “assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire.”

Although Canada has long prohibited possession of automatic guns, some semi-automatic firearms are not restricted and can be bought if purchasers obtain a basic possession and acquisition licence.

The Canadian Press





WASHINGTON -- Parliament will struggle to ratify the new North American trade deal if U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum exports aren't lifted soon, Canada's transport minister warned Sunday during a high-profile gathering of American state lawmakers.

Marc Garneau said time is running out for the federal government to get the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ratified before the House of Commons rises for the summer break, and it remains an open question whether it will happen without the tariffs being lifted.

""This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada, and I don't know if we're going to get there,"" Garneau told a free-trade panel during the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington.

""I'm making a plea here to the governors. I'm making a plea here that you bring up with the president of the United States the fact that these tariffs are a serious impediment to us moving forward on what is the best trade deal in the world.""

Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's economic adviser and one of Garneau's fellow panellists, acknowledged the tariff issue, which the minister raised multiple times.

""We are hard at work on that to solve that issue,"" Kudlow told Garneau. ""I got the message loud and clear.""

Following the panel, Kudlow struck a positive tone on hopes for finalizing USMCA, but more commonly in Canada as the ""new NAFTA."" He even told a story about how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embraced him in a hug when the three countries gathered in Argentina last year to sign the deal.

""We've had a great coming together in Argentina,"" he said, recalling the animosity that erupted last spring after the G7 meetings in Quebec, when Trump lashed out at the prime minister on Twitter over comments he made about the ongoing trade talks.

""In Argentina, he came up to me -- this is a true story -- after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that happened last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.""

Kudlow had his own request of the governors gathered Sunday: to lobby members of Congress to support the agreement, which has received decidedly mixed reviews on Capitol Hill, particularly among Democrats who want to see sharper enforcement teeth for the deal's labour and environmental provisions. A number also oppose extending protection for drug patents by two years.

And afterward, Kudlow urged Canadians to be patient, acknowledging the anxiety the tariffs have caused. Garneau ""mentioned it 13 times in our meeting,"" he joked.

""I acknowledged that he's correct, and that we're working on that, and I believe he knows that,"" Kudlow said. ""We're negotiating for a vote in Congress, and we're negotiating with our friends in Canada and Mexico on that subject.""

Garneau called it ""illogical"" that the White House is using national security to justify the tariffs, which were imposed last May and remain in place despite the signing last year of USMCA.

But he also said Canada would move quickly to approve the agreement once the tariffs are lifted.

""We want to see USMCA ratified in Canada,"" Garneau said. ""If the tariffs on steel and aluminum are removed, Canada will move expeditiously towards ratification of the USMCA; we believe very strongly in it.""

Garneau also said Canada would lift its own tariff countermeasures on $16.6 billion worth of U.S. imports, ""which we know are affecting many American companies.""

Canada's ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton said last week he believes the tariffs could be lifted in a matter of weeks, but refused to provide additional details.

Trump ended a Canadian exemption from the tariffs last spring in a move he later acknowledged was a negotiating tactic, and the president has also said the tariffs would be lifted once the deal was signed.

Kudlow was asked why, since the deal was signed late last year in Buenos Aires, the tariffs remain in place and what role they serve.

After a pause, he said: ""It's part of the rules of the game, that's what I'll say.

""There's no animosity, it's just that if you flip switches on and off, you really can't do that ... the steel and aluminum tariff discussion is an integral part of the larger legislative picture discussion, and don't take that negatively. It's actually a positive. We're going to figure it out.""","Tariffs could jeopardize new NAFTA deal in Parliament, Garneau warns - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/tariffs-could-jeopardize-new-nafta-deal-in-parliament-garneau-warns-1.4310267

Taking questions from reporters after an event in St. John's today, where he visited the Core Science Facility under construction at Memorial University, Trudeau called Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

Wernick told the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair that he warned Wilson-Raybould — who was justice minister at the time — that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Asked why Wernick and PMO officials pressed Wilson-Raybould to consider what was at stake in an SNC-Lavalin prosecution — given that the decision had been made already to proceed with that prosecution — Trudeau said the government has a fundamental responsibility to preserve jobs and promote economic growth while respecting the rule of law and an independent judiciary.

""That is something this government has always done,"" he said. ""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council. His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

The Public Prosecution Service told SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 4, 2018, that it would not negotiate with the company on a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, which would have applied alternative penalties to avoid criminal proceedings against the Quebec-based global engineering firm on bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

Wernick said he called Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19, 2018, to discuss various issues — including the option of a remediation agreement.

During that call, Wernick said he spoke of the implications of prosecuting the company for employees, suppliers and communities. He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in business media — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

Pressured to 'get it right'

""I am quite sure the minister felt pressured to get it right, and part of my conversation with her on Dec. 19 was conveying context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen ... the consequences not for her, the consequences for the workers, and the communities and the suppliers,"" he told MPs on Thursday.

Wernick said he did not cross any line in his exchanges with Wilson-Raybould, insisting the conversations were ""lawful and appropriate.""

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio.

Wilson-Raybould has remained silent on the issue, citing solicitor-client privilege. This week, she told the House of Commons that privilege is not hers to waive, and she hopes she is able to speak her ""truth.""

Opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have been demanding the prime minister waive privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak freely when she appears before the committee, which she is expected to do next week.

Wernick said Thursday he doesn't believe Wilson-Raybould is bound by solicitor-client privilege, but Trudeau said again on Friday that there are serious implications at play.

""This is something we do have to take very seriously because it's a fundamental part of our justice system and, indeed, in this case there are two ongoing court cases,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould's successor, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, is reviewing the matter, but has offered no indication of when he could provide advice to the prime minister on privilege.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says waiving solicitor-client privilege is a complicated matter and doesn't want to impact the two ongoing court cases involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair while taking questions from reporters during an appearance in St John's Friday. 1:15

As the controversy around SNC-Lavalin heats up, the company itself is facing headwinds. It reported Friday that it had slashed its dividend by 65 per cent and recorded a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion.

The company said it will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, compared to its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share.

'A political hockey game'

SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce told a news conference today that the company and its current employees have done nothing wrong.

""Our employees are being used as puck in political hockey game,"" he said. ""They don't deserve it and, frankly, we've had enough.""

Bruce said the company requested that the charges against it be ""circumvented"" through a remediation agreement — that it didn't ask for them to be dropped entirely. He argues that a remediation arrangement would be in the public's interest.

The company will ""vigorously defend"" itself in court, Bruce said.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau was asked Friday whether he thinks SNC-Lavalin can survive if the criminal prosecution proceeds.

""I really can't speak about the potential success of any individual business,"" he said in Toronto after meeting with private sector economists. ""I think in the case of SNC-Lavalin, it's an organization that's been very successful over a long period of time and we obviously want to see a business like that, that employs that many Canadians, continue to be successful.""","'Pay heed' to words of top bureacrat on SNC-Lavalin affair, Trudeau says",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-snc-lavalin-privy-council-st-john-s-1.5029516
260,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlines the motion he will introduce calling on the Prime Minister to appear before the Justice Committee . 1:25

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

261,Empty,2019-02-25T23:29:00Z,"Jody Wilson-Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react as the politically damaging affair grinds on, and that’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, Susan Delacourt writes.","Or is it? While Jody Wilson-Raybould’s split with the Prime Minister’s Office is not apparently linked to any leadership ambitions, it is abundantly clear now that the former justice minister is driving the bus in this whole saga over SNC-Lavalin .

Once again, without uttering a word about the specific grievances, Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react. Last week, she managed to get a hearing from cabinet and caucus — and this of course came after the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

On Monday, on the eve of her much-anticipated appearance at the Commons justice committee, Raybould demurred, issuing instead a long letter setting out the conditions under which she intended to speak.

So while Wilson-Raybould is not the leader or even a would-be leader of her party, she definitely has forced Liberals to follow her — if only to try to anticipate her next move.

That’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, new to cabinet and government a little over three years ago and a relative newcomer to the Liberal party.

When Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney’s cabinet in 1990, that Conservative government carried on without him. Ditto for Paul Martin’s exit from Jean Chretien’s cabinet in 2003. Damage was done in both cases, certainly in the long term, but neither prime minister seemed overly concerned with keeping the departed minister in the fold.

In fact, it’s difficult to remember any other politician who retained the power to keep dictating rules of engagement to a Prime Minister’s Office after leaving cabinet.

Trudeau’s reaction to this whole saga has been curious. For several days after the story of Wilson-Raybould’s grievances about SNC-Lavalin first broke in The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the prime minister did not speak to her.

Then he spoke to her a couple of times in Vancouver and seemed to be confident she would stay in cabinet — until she quit, hours later. He apologized to her behind the closed door of the cabinet room last Wednesday, only to have her stand up in the Commons and warn that she was waiting a chance to “speak my truth.”

Late last year, Trudeau was asked in one of his year-end interviews to sum up U.S. President Donald Trump in a word. “Unpredictable,” Trudeau replied, which summed up a lot of things, especially his disciplined silence in the face of Trump’s trade-related tantrum after the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix last June.

In the end, Canada and the U.S. did end up signing a new trade deal a few months later and Trump stopped calling Trudeau and Canada names on his angry Twitter feeds.

Trump’s unpredictability isn’t Trudeau’s biggest problem now — Wilson-Raybould’s is. But when you think about it, the prime minister is handling them the same way, which is probably a mistake.

Trudeau’s strategy on Trump, distilled to its essence, was basically this: say nothing, don’t rise to the bait and fan out to seek allies and experts while the situation cools down. A similar strategy seems to be under way now, inasmuch as the Trudeau government’s response can be called a strategy.

But Wilson-Raybould’s disaffection with Trudeau and how she’s been treated is looking far more methodical than Trump’s episodic outrage of last year.

What’s more, in Trump’s case, Trudeau could count on most of Canada to be on his side. With some exceptions, Canadians were more likely to stick up for their prime minister in any battle with the unpredictable Trump.

This confident streak — maybe overconfident streak — is at the nub of the Wilson-Raybould saga now. It is striking to see the ways in which Trudeau and his team have just left the slate blank in this whole tale, banking on the conviction that Canadians will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Each day in the Commons, this is basically what Trudeau says — that Canadians know his government is balancing concern for jobs and the law. “Trust us,” he says, while the government fans out, looking for experts and allies to attest to Trudeau’s integrity and hoping that the mess will go away.

Sometimes scandals do blow themselves out; sometimes ministers — or angry presidents — just go away, and governments carry on in their absence.

Nothing in this nearly three-week-old saga over Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin gives any indication of following that pattern. Trudeau and his government aren’t leading themselves out of the controversy — they’re following and reacting — and Wilson-Raybould is doing the leading.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government ordered a review of the Trans Mountain Project taking into account its impact on killer whales after the Federal Court of Appeal blocked it over concerns for the marine mammals.

The National Energy Board (NEB) said the project would have ""significant adverse environmental effects"" on the whales and an oil spill could have equally horrendous impacts on the marine environment.

But it concluded ""that they can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits of the project and measures to mitigate the effects.""

The federal government has 90 days to decide whether to give final approval for the project, but has signaled it may delay until after a general election in October.

The expansion of the 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) pipeline was to move 890,000 barrels of oil a day from landlocked Alberta province to the Pacific coast, replacing a smaller crumbling conduit built in 1953.

The Trudeau administration approved the project in 2016 after an initial environmental review, saying it was in the ""national interest"" to ease Canada's reliance on the US market and get a better price for its crude oil.

The pipeline has faced opposition from environmentalists and indigenous tribes (protest pictured March 2018) worried that increased shipping from a mraine terminal in Vancouver would impede the recovery of the local killer whale population

But it has faced opposition from environmentalists and indigenous tribes worried that increased shipping from a marine terminal in Vancouver would impede the recovery of local killer whale populations.

Ottawa bought the project for Can$4.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) in August, effectively nationalizing it in a bid to bring a swift end to legal challenges and protests at construction sites.

But on the same day, the Federal Court of Appeal ordered ministers to take a second look at the project, taking greater care to consult with indigenous tribes and consider marine traffic impacts.

Opponents of the pipeline said Friday the NEB recommendations do not satisfy their concerns, and vowed to continue their fight against it.

Former UFC welterweight champion and middleweight title holder Georges St-Pierre officially retired from mixed martial arts on Thursday.

He is one of only six UFC fighters to have held titles in multiple weight classes having also been welterweight champion for 2,204 days and won 26 of his 28 fights from 2002-17.

But what kind of legacy does the 37-year-old Canadian leave?

Here are five reasons he should be considered MMA's greatest of all time.

Champion's mentality

Throughout the 28 fights of his MMA career, St-Pierre displayed the heart of a true champion with his ability to not only go to the proverbial well to get the victory, but also by beating rivals at their own game.

He out-grappled Matt Hughes, Matt Serra and Jon Fitch, just like he out-struck Josh Koscheck, BJ Penn and Nick Diaz.

He went to war with Carlos Condit and Johnny Hendricks, and conclusively avenged the two losses he suffered inside the octagon.

Between 2007 and 2013 he dominated his weight class, defeating every leading welterweight contender the world could offer.

Even four years away from competition couldn't stop him from weathering a storm to choke out Michael Bisping in November 2017 and add a second weight-class world title to his incredible legacy.

A true martial artist

St-Pierre dedicated his life to martial arts and reaped the rewards.

In a sport, prior to GSP, littered with tough-talking street-fighting men, and more recently, with athletes as focused on the celebrity and entertainment aspect of prize-fighting as they are on training, St-Pierre bucked the trend.

He was always a true professional. Respectful, strategic and athletic, his behaviour was more reminiscent of the characters in the Bruce Lee or Jean-Claude Van Damme movies he adored than that of an overly aggressive, cauliflower-eared, toothless warrior.

Throughout his career, St-Pierre also searched out the best possible coaching to further his lifetime of marital arts education.

His journey took him to Renzo Gracie's in New York, Greg Jackson's in New Mexico, onto the mats with Muay Thai master Phil Nurse, the boxing ring with iconic coach Freddie Roach and, of course, he forged a long-time partnership with head coach Firas Zahabi.

He was always ahead of the curve, too, employing a sports psychologist early on in his title reign to stay on top.

A national hero

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on Twitter following St-Pierre's retirement

When Bisping retired last year, where was the reaction and tribute from British prime minister Theresa May? Likely she has never heard of MMA, the UFC or 'The Count'.

In Canada, however, GSP's career achievements enthralled the nation.

He was voted Canadian Athlete of the Year three times in a row between 2008-2010, and when he announced to the world he was walking away from the sport, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of the first dignitaries to take to social media to offer his admiration.

When he fought Jake Shields in April 2011, GSP proved he also didn't necessarily need the right dance partner to sell tickets, when 55,724 fans (the second biggest gate in UFC history) packed into the Rogers Centre in Toronto in to watch their hero retain his belt.

He makes his own rules

Long before Conor McGregor became the breakout superstar he is, there was another pay-per-view champion in the UFC who wasn't afraid to push back at the top brass.

When you get to the big show, most fighters are all about the three letters - UFC. But St-Pierre had three of his own that were always given priority - GSP. Once he was established as champion, he only took fights when he was ready.

He knew his worth, would push back on contract deals and danced by his own tune. He never swerved anybody, but he never took fights that weren't for the benefit of his own brand either.

He returned last year, beat Bisping and walked away from the 185lb belt. His terms. And that is part of the reason he quit for good this week.

He would have liked to face lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the unbeaten Russian who rag-dolled McGregor back in October. But having St-Pierre end the unbeaten reign of a fighter starting out on his PPV journey didn't appeal to the UFC.

After all, St-Pierre would only of likely stuck around for a Conor superfight in victory. Again, always on St-Pierre's terms.

He kept it clean

Long before the UFC partnered up with the US Anti-Doping Agency and employed Jeff Novitzky in a defiant move to clean up MMA, St-Pierre campaigned long and hard for a cleaner sport.

He even walked away from the octagon at one stage in protest at the lack of testing. And while that may not, on the face of it, seem relative to his GOAT potential, his legacy is untarnished. The same cannot be said of his two most decorated rivals.

Anderson Silva, a long-time potential crossover opponent for GSP, and the incredibly gifted Jon 'Bones' Jones both have comparable skill-sets, dominant title reigns and a similar long list of acclaimed opponents inside the octagon.

Yet both of their careers are now stained with multiple drug test failures. St-Pierre has never failed a test. He has never cheated, cut corners or broken the martial arts code of conduct.

OTTAWA—Discussions the Prime Minister’s Office had with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin are “troubling,” lack a strong legal justification and may have led to her being “fired,” a respected jurist said Monday.

The director of public prosecutions decided last fall to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, rejecting the company’s request for a remediation agreement that would have spared it a conviction and, with it, a 10-year ban on government contracts.

“Perhaps this is an instance where a prosecutor was actually fired for establishing a boundary that was not popular or accepted. I’m not sure of that. I think there is some suspicion and concern here about that.”

“In fact, prosecutors should not resign. Lead prosecutors, when they’ve taken a decision, should hold firm to their position and that is consistent with the rule of law,” Turpel-Lafond said.

Now those interventions are in the spotlight amid questions whether lines were crossed.

Wilson-Raybould appears to have stuck by that decision in the face of meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s senior aides and the top civil servant, despite concerns about the future of the Quebec company if the charges went ahead.

Turpel-Lafond, who currently practises law and teaches in Victoria, expressed serious doubts about the government’s claim — articulated by Wilson-Raybould’s successor, David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Liberal MPs — that officials are permitted to hold robust discussions with an attorney general under the so-called Shawcross Doctrine.

Once a decision is made to pursue a prosecution, there is “limited authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point and going forward,” Turpel-Lafond said.

She said if the talks went beyond a “more passive and respectful approach,” and the purpose “was to persuade the attorney general as prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern.”

And she cast doubt on Lametti’s and Wernick’s assertions that the decision to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin is one that still remains open to the attorney general, even with the preliminary inquiry underway.

She said there should be a “full” airing of what was said to Wilson-Raybould, adding it would be something she’d expect the RCMP’s sensitive investigations or “integrity” section would already be looking into.

Two other legal experts agreed that the Shawcross Doctrine — a concept imported from the United Kingdom — does not justify any pressure put on an attorney general to make or change a prosecutorial decision.

That decision, they said, is the attorney general’s alone to make.

“The attorney general should not be put under pressure by colleagues and in particular should not be put under partisan political pressure,” said Mary Condon, interim dean of Osgoode Hall Law School.

Maxime St-Hilaire, an associate law professor at the University of Sherbrooke, said the clear line would be better drawn if Canada’s attorney general did not also serve as justice minister inside a federal cabinet.

Trudeau told the House of Commons he would partially lift confidentiality obligations on his former attorney general so she can testify about allegations that his office was at the centre of what the Opposition says was a “sustained effort” to influence the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Under fire in the House for weeks, Trudeau told question period Monday that Wilson-Raybould would be able to appear at the justice committee and “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

Monday night, the Trudeau cabinet issued an order-in-council waiving cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould for discussions she had on SNC-Lavalin, clearing the way for her testimony to the committee.

However, “in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,” the waiver did not extend to communications Wilson-Raybould had with Kathleen Roussel, director of public prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin.

It was not entirely clear when her long-awaited appearance will be scheduled, as her expected appearance Tuesday was postponed.

In a letter sent earlier Monday to the committee, Wilson-Raybould stated that she is “anxious to appear at the first available time.”

But she said that she remained constrained by what she can say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and the ongoing cases involving SNC-Lavalin still before the courts.

“The government can waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. I cannot, Wilson-Raybould said in her letter to Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, chair of the committee.

She said she wants to delay her testimony until “we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.”

When she does appear, Wilson-Raybould said she wants to make an extended opening statement of about 30 minutes to provide “my best recollection of all relevant communications.”

Trudeau has denied he or anyone in his office applied any inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She has not yet spoken publicly to confirm or deny the allegation, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Late Monday, the Commons voted 155-106 against compelling Trudeau to testify before the committee, as the Conservative and NDP opposition wanted.

The prime minister again defended his actions, telling the Commons that “at every stage,” his government did what it promised Canadians, to stand up for jobs and growth while protecting the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.

“We’ve consistently and continually stood up for the 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin and good jobs right across the country,” Trudeau said.

“That’s exactly what we’ll continue to do and we will continue to do it in a way that ... always respects the rules and norms that govern our institutions.”

SNC-Lavalin and two former employees were charged in 2015 under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act with one count of bribing former members of the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and one count of fraud under the Criminal Code.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers’ integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de l’immigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers’ applications as the bill is being debated.

“This situation is a catastrophe for us,” said Seeun Park, a nurse and plaintiff in the case who came to Quebec with her two children from South Korea in 2017.

“We already invested a lot of money and efforts end energy to work in Quebec,” she told reporters on Friday outside the courtroom in Montreal.

A spokesman for the province’s immigration minister declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was before the court.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

The group of almost a dozen people were at a morning news conference to make their first public remarks since the deadly rampage last July that left two people dead and 13 wounded.

""What happened to us was a tragedy, and we think we could have had better odds had attitudes toward handgun ownership been different before that night,"" said shooting victim Noor Samiei, who was out with friends celebrating her 18th birthday on the night of the attack.

The group also revealed an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a petition calling for the ban.

Watch: Victims and families of Danforth shooting call for ban on handguns and assault rifles

The group says they would like to see handguns used for sport shooting owned by licensed shooting facilities, and not the people who take part in the activity. 2:02

""We acknowledge that this action is not the only step that needs to be taken to stem gun violence; however, we believe it will be impactful and effective,"" the letter reads.

The news conference coincides with the seven-month anniversary of the attack on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening on July 22 along Danforth Avenue in Toronto's Greektown neighbourhood, in an area also known as the Danforth.

Reese Fallon, 18, of Toronto, and Julianna Kozis, 10, of Markham, Ont., died.

'Are we going to learn?'

The group is calling out a perceived ""lack of action"" by governments to combat gun violence in the aftermath of the shooting.

""We miss Reese and we miss Julianna. We have to live with that, but we don't have to live with the laws that could be changed to help prevent this from happening again,"" Samiei told reporters.

""The pain and loss we feel without Reese and Julianna is indescribable,"" added 15-year-old Quinn Fallon, Reese Fallon's younger sister.

""Because Reese and Julianna don't have a voice anymore, we are doing this in their honour.""

The group says that despite the best intentions of responsible gun owners, too many firearms end up stolen and on streets across the country. They would like to see handguns used for sport shooting owned by licensed shooting facilities, and not the people who take part in the activity.

""Are we going to learn from our experience or are we going to express grief in the moment an move on? We are better than this as a nation,"" the open letter reads.

Ken Price, the father of a surviving victim, called on Canadians to sign a petition supporting the ban. 'We can improve our odds if you are supportive now,' he said. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

The Liberal government is in the process of exploring the possibility of a national handgun ban.

Bill Blair, minister of border security and organized crime reduction, is touring the country gathering information about the proposed ban, but the Danforth victims and family members worry the government will back off the plan.

""The families fear that the initiative will fall short of recommending a handgun and assault rifle ban, and they want to ensure they see action,"" according to the letter.

Blair is expected to make a recommendation to cabinet this month.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said Friday the investigation into the shooting is now complete. He said the force will release more information about the attack, though he didn't say when.

Crisis breaks out for Canadian PM Express.co.uk CANADA'S Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing the biggest political crisis of his career after allegations of serious wrongdoing by government officials...,"Opposition leader Andrew Scheer, of the Conservative Party, is launching a bid to get Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to reveal what he knows about the SNC-Lavalin affair. Mr Trudeau’s government has been tainted by allegations first made on February 7 in the Globe and Mail that his officials possibly prevented a criminal prosecution being launched against the Canadian construction company. The allegations concern former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould who was reportedly pressurised to drop trial charges against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and corruption in Libya and to levy a fine instead. Mr Trudeau has denied any involvement or knowledge of the claims.

Mr Scheer is proposing an opposition motion asking MPs to “order the Prime Minister to appear, testify and answer questions at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, under oath, for a televised two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019”, as reported by Global News. The publication stated Mr Scheer told reporters on Monday morning: “We are a country of the rule of law and nobody, no matter their status, their wealth or their connections, should be entitled to special treatment under it. “What we’ve seen unfold over the last few weeks is a textbook case of government corruption.” Ms Jody Wilson-Raybould, who has remained silent until now, will appear in front of a House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday.

Is Justin Trudeau set to be TOPPLED? Mr Trudeau is coming under increasing pressure and this morning's statement by Mr Scheer will have only further damaged his reputation. Meanwhile, another politician has also piled on the pressure for the Canadian Prime Minister after calling for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair. Pagemeet Singh, the leader of the left-wing NDP who is standing for a by-election in Burnaby South in the Vancouver, said he was not afraid to criticise the Liberal party. He said: ""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government.”

Canada news: Justin Trudeau with Jody Wilson-Raybould in January

Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned last week following her demotion from her ministerial role in January. What is revealed from her meeting on Tuesday could have serious implications for Mr Trudeau’s future as Canada’s Prime Minister. The public image of the handsome, feminist, tolerant leader appears to have already taken a battering, polling suggests. An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News taken after Mrs Wilson-Raybould's resignation showed the Liberals had dropped four percentage points since December to 34 percent. Their rivals, the Conservatives, were up two points at 36 percent, eight months ahead of the Canadian federal elections. Mr Trudeau has dodged more recent questioning about his officials’ interference, saying only there was no “directive”.

The problem is the Liberal government is standing in the way. What's a government to do?

The question at the centre of this saga is whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured by anyone in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to seek a deferred prosecution agreement in the criminal case involving Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been unequivocal in his answer. It's just that he's been answering a different question: No one directedher to secure a particular resolution.

But did anyone pressure her?

No one ""directed"" her.

Don't be confused. Ever since that unambiguous denial of a question that wasn't asked, the government's line on the matter has been consistent and clear: We would like to tell you more, but we simply can't, because we are choosing not to.

Solicitor-client privilege​

Last week, the Liberal majority on the Commons justice committee blocked efforts to call relevant witnesses — including Wilson-Raybould and PMO senior advisers Gerald Butts (who resigned Monday) and Mathieu Bouchard — before the committee. Expanding the witness list to those who were actually involved in the pertinent conversations would be akin to a ""witch hunt"" and a ""fishing expedition,"" explained Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault.

Instead, the committee would be calling legal experts, civil servants and the current attorney general, David Lametti, who had already said he has no direct knowledge of conversations between Wilson-Raybould and the PMO. The committee has not called anyone who can speak to the colour of the paint on the wall where these conversations took place, but alas, there is still time to add more witnesses. (Indeed, the committee eventually relented to calling Wilson-Raybould to testify after all.)

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

Proceedings began on Thursday, when Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick testified that the conversations with Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin were lawful and appropriate. He repeated the prime minister's line that if she felt pressure — due to the multiple conversations in which it was emphasized that the wrong decision on the matter could have dire economic consequences in Quebec — she should have reported it to the ethics commissioner.

Wilson-Raybould has not been able to publicly give her side of the story because, as she has noted previously, she is bound by solicitor-client privilege. The prime minister can waive that privilege should he choose, but he has not for a reason he has not coherently articulated other than to say he is discussing the matter with the current attorney general. During his testimony Thursday, Lametti was tight-lipped about his efforts on the matter, saying he himself is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Attorney General David Lametti, who took over the job from Jody Wilson-Raybould, provided little new information Thursday, saying he is bound by solicitor-client privilege. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

Now, the Liberals have been clear that they want to get to the bottom of this. It's just that all of the ways that have been proposed are not the correct ways to do so. They include a motion tabled by NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus calling for a public inquiry on the matter and for the prime minister to waive privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak. All but two Liberals voted against the motion Wednesday.

Earlier that day, Wilson-Raybould reportedly told cabinet, according to a Globe and Mail source, that she experienced inappropriate pressure from the PMO on SNC-Lavalin. Meaning that, within the span of a few hours, cabinet reportedly heard from Wilson-Raybould that she was improperly pressured, then voted against a motion to allow her to say that publicly.

Move to Veterans Affairs

There are questions the prime minister may answer on the matter that don't involve privilege or require him to speak directly on SNC-Lavalin's criminal case. They include why Wilson-Raybould was moved from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs even though other ministers maintained their posts during the last cabinet shuffle.

The prime minister has noted there are a ""range of factors"" that go into any decision to move a minister, but did not elaborate on the particular factors in Wilson-Raybould's case. There is no directive that requires Trudeau to keep this information confidential, but it nevertheless appears he is constrained by the parliamentary convention colloquially known as ""I'm Not Telling You Anything Else Because I Don't Want To.""

Indeed, if you trust the Liberals' words instead of their actions, it is clear they want to fulfil their promise of transparency; to free up Wilson-Raybould to ""speak my truth,"" as she requested in the House this week; to call upon all the relevant witnesses to testify; to allow a full and thorough public investigation. The problem is, the Liberals keep getting in the way. Alas, what is a Liberal government to do?

270,Empty,2019-02-24T09:00:00Z,Monday's federal byelections should shine a spotlight on some of the big themes of this election year.,"There's always something to learn from byelections. For starters, Jagmeet Singh will find out whether he has a future as the leader of the NDP.

But the results of all three of today's byelection contests also will shine a spotlight on some of the key dynamics that could decide the 2019 federal election.

Local factors always play a significant role in byelections, making it hazardous to draw overly broad conclusions from the results. But they're still instructive.

We know, for example, that how a party performs in byelections offers clues to how they might fare in subsequent general elections, that prime ministers with better byelection records have a higher chance of staying in office and that these seemingly minor affairs can have enormous historical significance.

There's certainly the potential for some drama tonight.

Singh is staking his leadership on the voters of Burnaby South, a riding in British Columbia's Lower Mainland. The area has voted for the NDP in every election since 2004 and even has a history of electing NDP leaders in need of a seat: Tommy Douglas won here in a 1962 byelection after he failed to secure a seat in his native Saskatchewan. Singh, a former Ontario MPP, is hoping to be offered the same hospitality.

If he doesn't get it, his days as leader of the NDP are likely to be numbered.

Can Singh put a halt to the NDP's struggles?

It speaks to a larger problem for the New Democrats. The party has made little headway since Singh became leader in October 2017. It's been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh's approval rating is in the red and he stacks up poorly against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on the question of who Canadians would prefer in the top job.

This has a wider impact on the electoral landscape. The Conservatives have a tough time winning elections when the NDP is weak.

Expectations are that Singh will win in Burnaby South. His party has poured its meagre resources into the riding and Singh — who has taken up residence in Burnaby — has been campaigning there for months.

There's no telling what impact a defeat there would have on the NDP. It could send the party into a tailspin from which it couldn't recover in time for the fall election. Or the party could install an interim leader with better prospects.

How to follow tonight's byelection results

Join us for results and analysis on a live Power & Politics byelections special, hosted by VassyKapelos and Éric Grenier, starting at 10 p.m. ET on cbc.ca, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. You can also follow results on a special edition of The National with Ian Hanomansing on CBC Television and CBC News Network - and check for updated results stories throughout the evening at cbc.ca/politics

With that kind of uncertainty looming over the party, the New Democrats might be satisfied with a win of any kind. The party needs some good news. If Singh can secure the seat by a comfortable margin, it could be the signal needed to give the NDP hope that the rest of the year will be better.

A squeaker of a win, however, would only mean that a lot of work remains to be done before the NDP starts seeing some light at the end of the tunnel — and the Conservatives start breathing easier.

Battleground GTA - if Bernier doesn't get in the way

The Conservatives are unlikely to lose any sleep over York–Simcoe, a riding located north of Toronto. It has been a safe seat for the party ever since the right was united in 2003. The Conservatives won it by 45 points in 2011 when Stephen Harper secured a Conservative majority government. They still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Harper went down to defeat.

While it's a more sprawling riding than many of those located throughout the Greater Toronto Area, it's still only a stone's throw away from some of the seats that decide every federal election. So while the results might not be emblematic of the battles that will be fought between the Liberals and the Conservatives in the GTA in the fall, they might still give us a clue to just how hamstrung the Conservatives could be in the region by Maxime Bernier.

Andrew Scheer's Conservatives are expected to hold the Ontario riding of York–Simcoe, but it's the results for Maxime Bernier's People's Party that will offer clues to how likely the Conservatives are to make gains in the rest of the Greater Toronto Area. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

The runner-up in 2017's Conservative leadership race still has a long way to go before his People's Party is in a position to challenge for anything but Bernier's own seat in the Beauce region of Quebec. The Poll Tracker pegs support for the PPC at just 2.5 per cent nationally.

But Bernier could still have a significant impact on the Conservatives' chances of winning seats in key regions of the country — such as the GTA.

A recent Innovative Research Group poll gave the PPC five per cent support in the suburban GTA. With Liberal support slipping in Ontario in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, a lot of their seats in the GTA are up for grabs. But fewer of them will flip over to Scheer's party if Bernier scoops up five per cent of the vote that otherwise would have gone to Conservative candidates.

The results in York–Simcoe will be a good gauge of just how much of a complication the People's Party will prove to be for Scheer in October.

Quebec and the Liberal path to re-election

If the Conservatives are banking on the GTA to propel them back to power (and are hoping Bernier stays out of the way), the Liberals are looking to Quebec to keep themselves in office.

The New Democrats won 16 seats in Quebec in the 2015 federal election. With their support in the province plummeting to just 8.9 per cent, according to the CBC Poll Tracker, the party is on track to lose every single one of them.

The Liberals are counting on that; they need gains in Quebec to offset expected losses in places like New Brunswick and Ontario. With 38.3 per cent support and a 17-percentage point lead over the Conservatives in the province, the Liberals are well-positioned to win most of those 16 seats.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is counting on Quebec to help him secure re-election in the fall. That plan starts with Outremont on Monday. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

Outremont would be high on that list of potential pick-ups. Prior to Tom Mulcair's breakthrough there in 2007, the riding was a Liberal stronghold. It's also the type of urban, diverse riding the Liberals tend to hold throughout the country.

An NDP win would be a tremendous upset and a signal that the Liberal plan for re-election is in big trouble. So Trudeau doesn't simply need to win Outremont — he needs his party to win it with a crushing margin. The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily. They'll want to see a big number there, and a small one for Singh's NDP.

They'd also like to see middling numbers for the Bloc Québécois, which is enjoying an uptick of its own under new leader Yves-François Blanchet. The Bloc was the perennial rival of the Liberals in Outremont before its collapse in 2011.

So when the results of Monday's three federal byelections start to come in, don't just look at who won and who lost. The implications might go far beyond that. In an election year, every tea leaf tells a story.

Yet the massive potential market for driverless cars, combined with rapid recent advancements in hardware, have helped convince hundreds of companies to target this nascent industry niche.

Below, we'll highlight just a few of those entities that deserve investor attention right now. Read on to see why Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are worth following over the coming weeks.

A computer-vision specialist

Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Ambarella): Investor sentiment turned negative against many small tech companies at the end of 2018 and helped push Ambarella shares sharply lower for the year. It didn't help that the semiconductor specialist, which produces low-power video compression hardware for miniature cameras, has seen sales growth grind to a halt while profitability declined in the last three quarters. Management's outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter isn't optimistic, either, with revenue set to slump by 29%.

Those low expectations could set shareholders up for gains when the company reports earnings results on March 1. CEO Fermi Wang and his team may highlight some good news, such as progress at securing a bigger client base for Ambarella's second generation of computer vision chips.

Early market share wins in this potentially booming industry would mark an important first step. However, Ambarella isn't likely to reverse its recent stock price slide until the company secures bigger avenues for growth and can raise prices to reflect its design innovation leadership. Investors will have a better idea about those trends when they see the 2019 sales and profitability outlook management will issue in the March report.

A bet on branded car tech

Jamal Carnette, CFA (BlackBerry): While it's simple to think of driverless cars as an all-or-nothing proposition, the reality is that vehicles are on a continuum from fully human operated to truly unmanned. In between these extremes are various features as mundane as cruise control and handsfree systems and as complicated as unassisted maneuvering and path tracking. BlackBerry's QNX technology has a strong foothold in this market, as its software/operating system (OS) is in more than 120 million cars across more than a dozen car brands performing many or all of these functions.

CEO John Chen has doubled down on cybersecurity and automotive applications as the company's focal points, specifically autonomous vehicles for the latter. Last quarter the company reported QNX had four design wins (a fancy way to say the automaker initially chose QNX) in advanced driver-assistance systems. Recently the company partnered with a Canadian start-up -- LeddarTech -- to provide the OS for LeddarTech's LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) platform.

The company is also seeing financial results from its QNX car-tech focus. Last quarter, BlackBerry's technology solutions division reported 23% year-over-year growth owing to its automotive vertical. Despite the green shoots of success, the company is not resting on its laurels in autonomous vehicles as it did with smartphones and has a huge backer in the form of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; BlackBerry is getting a CA$40 million grant from the Canadian government to develop next-gen technologies that will power autonomous cars.

BlackBerry's QNX is already a mainstay in automobiles, and the company is looking to leverage those relationships to become the de facto plug-and-play OS in autonomous vehicles, akin to Alphabet's Android in smartphones. Investors who believe driverless cars are the next big thing would be wise to put the company on their watch lists and follow this industry closely.

A beaten-down chipmaker

Leo Sun (NVIDIA): NVIDIA lost about 40% of its value over the past six months over concerns about slowing sales of its data center and gaming GPUs. NVIDIA attributed those declines to three causes: the end of the cryptocurrency boom, which flooded the market with cheap GPUs; softer demand in China; and weak sales of its new Turing-based GPUs.



NVIDIA's revenue plunged 24% annually last quarter, but it allayed some of those fears with a forecast for flat to slightly negative sales growth in fiscal 2020 -- which was slightly better than the consensus forecast for a 5% decline.

NVIDIA is best known for its gaming GPUs, but its Tegra CPUs also power cars. NVIDIA currently supplies over 370 Drive partners -- including automakers, suppliers, and service providers -- with its driverless technologies. Its Drive PX, PX 2, PX Xavier, and PX Pegasus platforms all let automakers add driverless capabilities to their cars by plugging in an onboard computer.

NVIDIA's Automotive revenues rose 23% annually to $163 million last quarter. That accounted for only 7% of the chipmaker's top line, but it helped its data center and professional visualization businesses partly offset a 45% plunge in gaming revenues.

During the quarter, NVIDIA launched Drive AutoPilot, the world's ""first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system."" It also announced a new partnership with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz to create a ""centralized computing architecture"" for next-gen AI-controlled vehicles.

These moves could widen NVIDIA's moat against Intel, which became a major player in the automotive market after its takeover of Mobileye, which provides ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) solutions to about 90% of the world's automakers. Looking ahead, investors should see if NVIDIA's auto business can keep expanding as the chipmaker tries to turn around its core gaming business.",3 Top Driverless Car Stocks to Watch in February,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/22/3-top-driverless-car-stocks-to-watch-in.aspx

James McCarten, The Canadian Press





WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump's senior economic adviser gave Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a symbolic pat on the back Sunday for how the federal government has been ""hanging tough"" on the diplomatically delicate extradition case of senior Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou.

Larry Kudlow said he's ""proud"" of how Canada has handled the Meng matter -- a tacit acknowledgment of the diplomatic bind the U.S. Justice Department created for the federal Liberals in December when they asked that the chief financial officer and telecom scion be arrested and held in Vancouver, pending extradition.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is at the centre of a sprawling U.S. indictment unsealed last month that accuses the growing tech juggernaut of misrepresenting its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary between 2007 and 2017 to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran. She and the company are facing 13 counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice.

""I'll just say how proud I am of Prime Minister Trudeau, and Canada, for hanging tough on Huawei,"" said Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council.

He acknowledged the grief the case has caused Canada since Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver pending an extradition hearing, was detained at the city's airport in early December: two Canadians have since been detained in China, ostensibly for national security reasons, while a third -- convicted by a Chinese court of drug trafficking -- is facing the death penalty.

""That's why I'm so I'm so proud of Prime Minister Trudeau for staying with the rule of law and assisting the United States. I'm very proud of him.""

Kudlow made the comments following an appearance on a free-trade panel at the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington alongside federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau. And it wasn't the only instance that he dropped the prime minister's name.

As world leaders were gathering last year in Argentina, where Trump, Trudeau and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the prime minister approached Kudlow in an effort to move past the animosity that had erupted six months earlier at the G7 meetings in June in Quebec.

Trump, apparently piqued by Trudeau's hard-line rhetoric on tariffs and trade, unleashed a Twitter tirade that denounced the prime minister as ""dishonest"" and ""weak,"" refusing in the end to sign on to the agreed-upon end-of-summit communique. Kudlow called Trudeau's comments a ""betrayal,"" while U.S. trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested he deserved a ""special place in hell.""

The dust-up left Canada-U.S. relations, already strained over the ongoing NAFTA talks and a burgeoning cross-border tariff war, at their lowest point in recent memory -- until Trudeau crossed the corridor to reach out to Kudlow.

""He came up to me -- this is a true story -- after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that occurred last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.

""Justin just grabbed my hand and gave me a bear hug, and I was thrilled.""

Asked whether the animosity has similarly diminished between the two leaders, Kudlow said: ""I think it's partly happened.""

On Friday, Trump himself floated the possibility -- again -- that the U.S. could drop criminal charges against Huawei, as the president wrapped up two days of negotiations at the White House aimed at resolving America's own ongoing trade dispute with China.

""We're going to be discussing all of that during the course of the next couple of weeks,"" Trump said at the White House during an Oval Office meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy, Vice Premier Liu He.

""We'll be talking to the U.S. attorneys. We'll be talking to the attorney general. We'll be making that decision. Right now, it's not something we've discussed.""

Late Sunday, Trump announced he would hold off on a dramatic spike in tariffs on Chinese exports, originally scheduled for Friday, pending the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks that he said on Twitter have ""made substantial progress.""

""Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself at Mar-a-Lago to conclude an agreement.""","Trump adviser Kudlow 'proud' of Canada, Trudeau, for approach to Huawei case - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trump-adviser-kudlow-proud-of-canada-trudeau-for-approach-to-huawei-case-1.4310520

The scandal, over whether the prime minister’s office pressured its justice ministry to help a Quebec firm facing fraud charges, has consumed the nation for the past two weeks. Each detail that has dripped into the public domain has generated multiple opinion columns and dominated airwaves.

Part of that scrutiny owes to the federal electoral season – with the opposition seizing on any whiff of Mr. Trudeau tainting the rule of law as the nation heads to the polls this fall. But it’s also captured public attention because it seems to stand in opposition to everything that Trudeau, and the Canada he represents, stands for: a respite to the pressures squeezing the rule of law, human rights, and liberal values in the rest of the world.

When Trudeau was propelled into power, it was his brand as a fresh and youthful face, positive politics, and a new and more transparent way of governance that drew the electorate to him. While more than three years of decisionmaking at the top has necessarily damaged his “real change” brand, he remains a beacon for many middle-power countries in the world, especially as the United States under President Trump has put into question the American commitment to a rules-based, international order.

Now Trudeau faces charges that his government is, essentially, just like everybody else’s.

A WOMAN BORN TO NOBLE PEOPLE

The scandal began after The Globe and Mail published a report earlier this month that alleged that the prime minister’s office put pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution for its dealings in Libya. According to the newspaper, she resisted. She was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and has since resigned – without revealing anything about why, citing solicitor-client privilege.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould is a powerful symbol of Trudeau’s branding. She both personified his pledge to build a new relationship with indigenous people in Canada as a historic reconciliation and his commitment to gender equality.

And while the main issue that could damage Trudeau concerns the rule of law, Alex Marland, author of “Brand Command: Canadian Politics and Democracy in the Age of Message Control,” says that gender and race add to the scandal at a sensitive moment.

“If the attorney general happened to be a white guy, to what extent would the story be an issue? It would still be an issue,” he says. “It’s just that because it happens to be an indigenous woman and this particular prime minister – and not even just the prime minister, it’s just the nature of society at the moment. It’s really a sensitive thing to have a white man and a prime minister demote an indigenous woman, especially in Canada where we’re going through this period of reconciliation.”

When the scandal broke, Trudeau immediately said he did not “direct” Wilson-Raybould to reach an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, which faces charges of fraud and corruption. The firm employs 9,000 people in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Liberals in the election. But Trudeau’s carefully constructed statement only led to speculation that he was engaging in a semantics game because the government had something to hide. He tried to stifle it by saying her continued presence in his cabinet spoke for itself. The next day she stepped down, signing her resignation “Puglaas,” her name in her native Kwak’wala language, which means “a woman born to noble people.”

Days later Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s longtime friend and influential principal secretary, resigned. In his letter he said there was no untoward pressure placed on Wilson-Raybould, but his resignation only turned up the speculation.

It was only in testimony in the House of Commons justice committee last week that Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council of Canada, shed some light on a basic timeline of meetings that have taken place. He essentially admitted a degree of pressure placed on the justice minister but said that it wasn’t inappropriate.",A murky scandal threatens to mar Trudeau's – and Canada's – good names,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/murky-scandal-threatens-mar-trudeaus-canadas-good-names-220949695.html

RCMP arrested Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport in December at request of the U.S., which is seeking her extradition on fraud charges, and Trudeau has repeatedly said that the government will not interfere in the process.

Nine days after Meng’s arrest, China detained two Canadians on allegations that they were endangering the country’s national security. It also increased another Canadian’s sentence on drug trafficking charges from 15 years to the death penalty.

China has not linked the moves to Meng’s detention, but the fallout has nonetheless been a diplomatic chill between Canada and China in recent months.

Kudlow acknowledged as much on Sunday, saying he appreciates the Canadian government sticking to its guns by not allowing Meng — or the detained Canadians — to become bargaining chips in wider trade discussions.

“Is it part of the overall trade landscape, if you will? Yes. But it’s principally a legal matter and not a trade matter,” Kudlow said.

The notes are being sought by the legal team defending the former vice chief of the defence staff against a single charge of breach of trust. Norman is accused of leaking cabinet secrets in relation to a shipbuilding deal.

The subpoenas were issued by the court at the request of Toronto lawyer Marie Henein, who is preparing a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of alleged political interference.

The court order for notes includes both the prime minister and Butts, and also Trudeau's Chief of Staff Katie Telford, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Zita Astravas, chief of staff to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.

Henein told the court Friday she views obtaining those notes as a ""high priority"" for the defence.

""These requests have been outstanding for some time,"" she said. ""I just want to make sure we're moving to the top of list the material that may be relevant to the abuse of process motion.""

Justice Heather Perkins-McVey noted that Wernick ""has been quite busy this week"" — a reference to the clerk's testimony Thursday before the House of Commons justice committee, which is investigating allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC Lavalin.

At a pretrial hearing on Friday, the Department of Justice indicated officials are still in the process of collecting the notes and could not say when they will be turned over.

""We've made it a priority, along with some other priority tasks,"" said Robert MacKinnon, the Department of Justice lawyer who is shepherding the disclosure of federal government documents. ""I think you can appreciate everyone is working at full speed.""

Focused request

Henein asked the court last October to force the government to deliver up communications between the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council, which supports and advises Trudeau.

The demand for documents was narrowed on Feb. 1 after Astravas testified at the pretrial hearing last month that she could not recall the substance of any conversations within the PMO about the Norman case while she was a senior official there.

The former commander of the navy is accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million shipbuilding deal in 2015. He is one of two people charged in the case; federal procurement official Matthew Matchett also faces a single count of breach of trust.

Henein will present a motion to dismiss the case — citing abuse of process — at the end of March.

Many of the documents being sought by the defence — including items of witness evidence — have not been fully disclosed.

The RCMP conducted many of its interviews in the winter and spring of 2016, two years before Norman was charged. The Crown is obliged to disclose documents and notes the witnesses relied on in giving their statements to police.

The process, however, has been hung up because the government is worried the notes may reveal cabinet secrets. Justice Perkins-McVey has said it's ""baffling"" that the Crown still has not produced the records.

Cases Intersect

Norman's lawyers alleged political interference in the case earlier this month, claiming the Crown had inappropriate conversations with the top lawyer in the Privy Council Office, which supports and advises the prime minister.

The director of public prosecutions vehemently denied the claim in an extraordinary public statement on Feb. 12.

The issue of prosecutorial independence strikes at the heart of the justice system and has been the key factor in the controversy involving SNC Lavalin and former justice minister Jody-Wilson-Raybould.

Wernick, testifying before the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, tacitly acknowledged both the Norman and SNC cases intersect over the claims of Crown separation.

He twice cited the prosecution of the former vice chief of the defence staff and attempted to assure MPs that the justice system remains solid.

""There is a statutory legal force field around the prosecution function in Canada,"" Wernick said ""We have the strongest protection of independent prosecution that I can think of.

Worldwide, Canada is held in high regard, due in large part to generations of goodwill, upholding the ideals of human dignity, our unique British and French legal heritage, and enforcement of the rule of law. The rule of law means that there is one law for all and that no one is favoured — especially the powerful and influential at the expense of everyone else.

Canada’s well-deserved reputation is now in jeopardy, as Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, accused of criminal wrongdoing, appears to be receiving special treatment from the Trudeau government.

Now, the news is swirling about the resignation from cabinet of former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said recently: “The government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it.”

But Canadians have questions. What are those standards? What are the criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin? What is a remediation agreement? Why do the Conservative and NDP members on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice want to hear testimony from all involved under oath? Why is Opposition leader Andrew Scheer demanding disclosure of information and preservation of documents?

As an experienced lawyer and former cabinet minister, I can provide answers to some of these questions. The larger questions, however, must be answered by Trudeau, his cabinet colleagues and his staff.

The standards have been set by the Supreme Court of Canada. Attorneys general must act independently of political pressures when exercising their delegated sovereign authority to initiate, continue or terminate prosecutions.

Justice Marc Rosenberg further summarized them in the “Shawcross” doctrine. Prosecution decisions taken by an attorney general require her to take into account the public interest, allow for her consultation with cabinet colleagues (covered by cabinet confidentiality in any event), but draws the line at taking cabinet or prime minister direction, and specifically does not allow government to put any pressure on an attorney general for political reasons.

The criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin and many of its executives go back several years and have included paying up to $160 million in bribes to government officials to obtain contracts in Libya. Similar previous charges were brought regarding a project in Bangladesh. Several company executives and implicated Canadian public servants have already been convicted or pled guilty to corruption offences.

In 2015, charges were laid against the company itself, and it has publicly claimed the resulting loss of billions of dollars in contracts and share value. If convicted, the company could face a 10-year ban on winning any federal government contracts and a similar ban on any projects financed through the World Bank.

What is a remediation agreement? First, although it is now law, I have seen little comment on how this legislation was passed a mere five months ago. When this legislation came into force as part of an omnibus bill, many in Ottawa referred to it as the “SNC-Lavalin bill.”

For the first time, prosecutors may enter into formal agreements with organizations that self-report wrongdoing or stand accused of having committed crimes, as an alternative to prosecution.

These crimes can be serious, such as bribery, money laundering, theft, forgery or fraud. Criminal prosecution is suspended pending agreed-upon terms and can result in all charges being stayed.

Published reports assert that SNC-Lavalin had been forcefully lobbying for this change in Canada’s criminal law, which by September 2018 was achieved. In October 2018, however, federal prosecutors told SNC-Lavalin that Canada would not negotiate a remediation agreement with it. The company has sought a judicial review of that decision, keeping all issues alive.

In this context, reports recently surfaced of the Trudeau government “heavily pressuring” Wilson-Raybould to drop the criminal prosecution in favour of a remediation agreement that could see all charges dropped.

Only those involved know what actually took place. Was “heavy pressure” applied? What was the nature of that heavy pressure? Who applied the heavy pressure? In what context?

Heavy pressure brought on the attorney general by the prime minister, or anyone on his behalf, to reverse the prosecution’s earlier decision for political gain would certainly breach the Shawcross doctrine.

Why is this a political issue? SNC-Lavalin employs approximately 9,000 Canadians and is seen by some as one of those companies that is too big to fail. But no company is too big to fail.

If a company fails due to its own corrupt dealings as proven, or pled guilty to, in a fair court process, other employers will come forward to do the work at hand. Indeed, SNC-Lavalin operates in a very competitive industry.

There is no doubt that the changes to Canada’s criminal law by the federal Liberal government could benefit the company, but once federal prosecutors refused to offer a remediation agreement, other than judicial review, its only option is for the prosecution to change its mind.

The only person with the authority to direct the prosecution to change its mind is the attorney general.

Canadians deserve answers to this government chaos.

Western Canadians deserve answers as to why the Trudeau government stood by as vibrant, job-creating, ethical companies in the West were allowed to implode, losing tens of thousands of jobs, while special attention was reserved for a company under criminal suspicion with a long history of questionable business practices, but with close ties to the Liberal government.

While Canada has been a country for a much shorter period, in the U.K. the privy council has served to advise monarchs on legislation, justice and the functioning of government for centuries.

Wernick's appearance before the justice committee served to open the door of Canada's ""private council"" and shed some light on the role of the privy council clerk in a democratically elected government.

In Canada, the clerk holds three positions. The first is to act as the deputy minister for the prime minister, fulfilling a bureaucratic role. The second is to be secretary of the federal cabinet and the third is to act as the head of the federal public service.

Wernick laid out that part of the job but more importantly he detailed how he fulfilled those roles with respect to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office in the ongoing court case involving SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The committee asked Wernick to appear because it is examining whether Trudeau or someone in his office tried to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould — when she held the dual role of attorney general and justice minister — to allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid charges on corruption and fraud by offering it the option of a remediation agreement as an alternative to prosecution.

Wernick said that he did, in fact, speak with Wilson-Raybould about the decision to prosecute the firm, making the case that there would be economic consequences for the Montréal-based company and its 9,000 plus Canadian employees if she chose to disregard the remediation option.

While no former clerks of the privy council would speak to CBC News on the record, a source with intimate knowledge of the position explained that making a strong case to Wilson-Raybould to seek remediation was an entirely justified position for the clerk to take.

Clerks 'want good decision making'

The source said that the clerk's role, in a sense, makes them responsible for cabinet decision making by ensuring the appropriate steps are taken to execute cabinet decisions.

The clerk also has the responsibility to ensure that the public interest is considered in cabinet decisions.

""It is perfectly legitimate for the clerk to call the attorney general and and say: 'have you considered employment in Montreal' in the decision they are going to make,"" the source said.

Watch Michael Wernick address MPs:

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

The attorney general, however, can disregard the public interest under the law, the source said, if it is determined that a person at the centre of a case has been found guilty of corrupting foreign officials. But the clerk still provides the advice.

""An effective clerk will make sure that ministers have these facts because they also want good decision making. They want everything on the table for them to take into account,"" David McLaughlin, a former chief of staff to Brian Mulroney and deputy minister to New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord, told CBC News Network's Power & Politics.

Appropriate vs. inappropriate pressure

The source also said that the line between appropriate pressure and pressure that crosses the line is not complicated.

If, in the case of Wilson-Raybould, the prime minister told her that she had to make a specific decision or she would be kicked out of cabinet, that would be crossing the line, the source said.

Watch David McLaughlin discuss the job of privy council clerk:

Brian Mulroney's former chief of staff David McLaughlin weighs in on the first day of the justice committee's probe. 8:23

But the level of pressure would be appropriate, and just, if the prime minister told Wilson-Raybould that she should take the weekend to really think over her decision because prosecuting SNC-Lavalin could put thousands of people out of work and potentially sink an important Canadian company.

""There is nothing wrong with that whatsoever, and it doesn't matter who the prime minister uses as his messenger, whether it's the clerk, a member of the PMO's staff or [he] tells the minister himself,"" the source said.

Cabinet confidence

The clerk is also responsible for determining what documents or discussions are covered by cabinet confidence and ensuring that cabinet confidences persist. All of his rulings are final and cannot be appealed to a court.

So if the clerk decides that a conversation or written correspondence between two ministers or a minister and the prime minister are a cabinet confidence, then the content of that discussion remains confidential.

""His job is not political at all,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. ""I'll define the clerk this way: it's operationally oriented but politically sensitive. In contrast, the Prime Minister's Office is politically oriented but has to be operationally sensitive.""

Wiseman said the role is ""absolutely non-partisan.""

That's something McLaughlin said Wernick demonstrated well during his appearance at committee. While the position is non-partisan, the prime minister can appoint whomever he wants to the role.

Wernick, it should be noted, was appointed to the position of deputy clerk of the privy council and associate secretary to cabinet by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and promoted to clerk by Trudeau.

""His job is not to give political advice,"" said Wiseman.

The clerk is there to anticipate issues or concerns that will arise as a direct result of policy decisions and to inform the prime minister of what those are.

""That's part of the background analysis, basically trying to assess what will be the consequences of a particular decision, what are the pros, what are the cons,"" said Yan Campagnolo, assistant law professor at the University of Ottawa. ""Certainly that's something that public servants do in general, and the clerk is at the top of the pyramid.""

Kudlow made the comments on a panel at the National Governors Association’s winter meeting in Washington on Sunday. He spoke after Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said “I don’t know if we are going to get there” in approving the deal if the tariffs aren’t removed.

The duties are no longer needed now that the two countries and Mexico have agreed on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, Garneau said. Kudlow also suggested that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working toward having the tariffs removed.

“Ambassador Lighthizer and his group, we are working on that, we are hard at work on that, to solve that issue,” Kudlow said of the metals tariffs after Garneau spoke. Earlier in the panel discussion, Kudlow said the new three-nation agreement was “very strong” and that Trump taught him tariffs can be a good negotiating tactic to break down trade barriers.

Canada retaliated dollar-for-dollar against U.S. tariffs last year, and Garneau’s comments on Sunday were some of the sharpest about the dispute since then as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau leads his government toward an October election. Garneau said that while political energy may shift to other issues in coming months, the tariffs alone are a major stumbling block to ratification.

‘Unnecessary Tax’

“Those tariffs are an unnecessary tax which is weighing down on both countries,” said Garneau, a former astronaut who served on U.S.-led space missions. He also said the original U.S. justification for tariffs on national security grounds was never justified.

“This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada -- I don’t know if we are going to get there,” Garneau said.

Canada would quickly drop its metals tariffs and ratify the agreement in response to a U.S. move, Garneau said. “We want to go ahead and do it because this is very good for both of our countries,” Garneau said of ratifying the trade agreement.

Garneau appealed to the governors in the audience to push the Trump administration to drop the tariffs, noting that Canada is the top export market for many U.S. states. The U.S. also has a $2 billion surplus in steel trade with Canada, and the bilateral deficit on aluminum is because America needs more of that metal than it can produce, Garneau said.

Letter to Ross

Mexican officials have also called for the metal tariffs to be removed, and a coalition of business, agricultural and trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter in January asking the same of Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Kudlow touted the new trade agreement on Sunday before Garneau spoke, saying it was a “template” for other pacts and would bring $62 billion of auto investment to the U.S. Such agreements are better than broad, multilateral trade pacts that sink to the “lowest common denominator,” Kudlow said.

Passing the USMCA would also be helpful as a “show of unity” by North America against other trade competitors like China, he said.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters in St John’s, Newfoundland when asked about his conversations with then Justice Minister July Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau’s remarks were among the most detailed yet to explain an affair that is harming his Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Trudeau denies a Feb. 7 report in the Globe and Mail that officials exerted undue pressure last year on Wilson-Raybould to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

SNC-Lavalin is a big employer in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats to have any chance of winning a majority in the election.

After Canada’s director of public prosecutions ruled on Sept. 4 that the trial should proceed, Trudeau and senior officials raised the matter three times with Wilson-Raybould, who had the power to overturn the decision.

The company, which says the executives accused of wrongdoing have left and that it has overhauled ethics and compliance systems, says a trial could be devastating and has gone to court to try to overturn the ruling.

Wilson-Raybould, who quit last month after being demoted to veterans affairs minister in January, has said nothing. She is due to address the House of Commons justice committee next week.

Opposition politicians accuse the government of mounting a cover-up and are demanding a public inquiry.

Michael Wernick, the head of Canada’s non-partisan civil service, on Thursday said he had contacted Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19 to discuss fears over what might happen in a trial but denied he had exerted any inappropriate pressure.

“(I) was conveying the context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, but the consequences for the workers and the communities and the suppliers,” he told the justice committee.",Canada PM says concern over job losses at heart of SNC-Lavalin affair,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QB20G

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

He's up against Richard Lee (Liberal), Jay Shin (Conservative) and Laura Lynn Thompson (People's Party).

Singh has been without a seat since he was chosen as leader of the NDP in October 2017. The B.C. riding has been the focus of the party's heaviest campaigning efforts since Singh announced he would run for that seat in August. Expectations are Singh will take the win in this byelection.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

Outremont

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

The Montreal riding of Outremont (CBC)

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

The evolving scandal is the subject of a study in the House Justice Committee that is set to reach a new level of attention this week when the former minister at the centre of the story, Jody Wilson-Raybould, testifies. Her appearance at committee is expected Tuesday at the earliest.

Prior to that, the opposition day motion that MPs are set to debate on Monday will make a new attempt at getting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to speak about the case. According to the House of Commons website, the motion deals with the “Appearance of the Prime Minister before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.” Two previous attempts to have senior PMO staff testify at the committee were unsuccessful, as was a motion to compel Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege and have a public inquiry launched.

Citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that Trudeau’s office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. This is something she had the ability to do in that role, but she did not, despite several meetings and conversations on the matter after federal prosecutors decided to carry on with the criminal case.

Months later she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, and was replaced as attorney general and justice minister by Quebec MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould accepted her new position, but then resigned from cabinet days after the story broke.

To date, the government maintains that nothing improper occurred, though Trudeau’s principal secretary resigned over the matter on Feb. 18, denying any wrongdoing.

Deputy Conservative Leader and justice critic Lisa Raitt said the testimony of the clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick at the House Justice Commitee on Thursday laid out the level of effort to have Wilson-Raybould reconsider her decision.

Wernick, Canada's most senior bureaucrat, disputed the allegations. He said that while it's likely Wilson-Raybould could have felt pressured, those probing the matter will have to determine whether that or other conversations constitute as ""inappropriate pressure.""

Raitt said she thinks it’s clear that it was improper.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end,” Raitt said on CTV’s Question Period. “And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.”

As Wernick argued, there is pressure on every decision made by a cabinet minister.

Citing a conversation he had with Wilson-Raybould about the case, months after the prospect of a remediation agreement was rejected by federal prosecutors, Wernick—who has been a public servant under both Liberal and Conservative governments over the last three decades— said he did convey to her the ""context"" that: ""There were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences. Not for her, the consequences for the workers and the communities, and the suppliers.""

This, Wernick argued, signals that the system is working and that he is confident that the conversations he had with Wilson-Raybould on the matter were ""lawful and appropriate.”

NDP MP and justice critic Murray Rankin disagreed.

“No means no... Why are they continuing to brow-beat her?” Rankin said on CTV’s Question Period. “There’s clearly a line that was crossed it seems.”

Liberal MP Marco Mendicino said that it is part of Wernick’s responsibility to bring to the AG’s attention any new information that comes to light around a legal case that may impact innocent third parties, like the workers for large corporations.

Wernick predicted that Wilson-Raybould will, when she testifies, express concern with three events: A meeting she had with Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin, at which Wernick was present; a second meeting between PMO staff and Wilson-Raybould's chief of staff on Dec. 18; and a third phone conversation Wernick had with her on Dec. 19, which he classified as a check-in heading into the winter sitting of Parliament.

Citing the multiple discussions with Wilson-Raybould from senior level PMO and PCO officials, CTV political commentator Tom Mulcair said that ""Wernick admitted that he put pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould full stop. That’s the starting point on this.""

""Whatever modifier Mr. Wernick or anybody else wants to put on it is not there. He’s not denying they put pressure on her, and he says ‘well I was just giving her context.’ Yeah sure,” Mulcair said.

‘Multiple conversations’ on tough files

On CTV’s Question Period, Labour Minister Patty Hajdu was asked about the evidence and testimony that has come to light so far. She said that while she could not speak on whether or not Wilson-Raybould felt pressure, it has not been her personal experience when it comes to interactions with Trudeau or his office.

Hajdu said she has had a number of frank and ""vigorous"" conversations on tough files and she has never felt ""undue pressure.""

""Whenever I’ve had challenging files, whenever we’ve had difficult situations often times there are multiple conversations about decisions that will impact Canadians…. Because these decisions have such an impact,"" Hajdu said.

She said she is looking forward to the outcome of the justice committee’s work, and the findings of the federal ethics commissioner probe before making any judgement on the situation.","SNC-Lavalin testimony indicates a line was crossed, opposition parties say - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/snc-lavalin-testimony-indicates-a-line-was-crossed-opposition-parties-say-1.4309481

Before shutting out the media, Justin Trudeau and Dwight Ball had a brief photo op, where they revealed some of what would be discussed.

""Today we'll have some discussion on things like Innu children in care,"" said Ball. ""I want to have a discussion on pharmacare of course, Bill C69, but of course the number one priority right now is continuing the discussion on the Atlantic Accord.""

Trudeau agreed, saying it was a priority to ""move forward positively"" on the Atlantic Accord discussions.

In a press release issued after the meeting, Ball said the conversations ""focused on Newfoundland and Labrador being the primary beneficiary of its offshore resources and the joint management of those resources.""

They hope to finalize the Atlantic Accord review by the end of March.

No mention of SNC-Lavalin during speech

Earlier in the day, Trudeau took a tour of Memorial University's core science building, which is still under construction, and gave a speech to Liberal donors at the Alt Hotel in downtown St. John's.

His speech focused on how faith in public institutions is dissipating around the world — he mentioned the United States, France and the United Kingdom, but neglected to mention the burning issue of the SNC-Lavalin affair at home.

""There's a time right now where people around the world are mistrustful of their institutions, worried that they are not being supported in the transformations of the world around them. And that's causing people and the democracies around the world to lash out in various ways,"" he said.

Not only did he leave out any mention of tensions in Canada, Trudeau said his government is doing just the opposite.

""What we are doing here in Canada is reinforcing faith in those institutions … governments can't do everything, but what it does do, it should do well.""

During the tour at Memorial University, Trudeau was asked about the SNC-Lavalin scandal. He said people should pay close attention to comments made this week by Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

""Canadians expect us always to be standing up for jobs, to be making sure that we're protecting economic growth across the country, and indeed promoting it. That is one of the fundamental jobs that anyone expects of their government,"" Trudeau said.

""But they of course expect their government to do that in ways that respects the rule of law, upholds the independence of our judiciary, and defends our institutions, and that is something that this government has always done.""

Playing to a local audience, Trudeau recounted his bachelor party in Newfoundland — when he and MP Seamus O'Regan went seakayaking in a snowstorm, and Trudeau says he got thrown out of the Sundance on George Street.

Muskrat Falls on the agenda

During the tour at Memorial University, Trudeau was asked by reporters about the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, which is over budget, behind schedule and the subject of an ongoing public inquiry. He was asked whether or not there would be another federal loan guarantee.

""We will continue to work with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador on ways to ensure that the cost of living is affordable, like we do right across the country,"" Trudeau said.

""We have given significant loan guarantees to the Muskrat Falls project, which has reduced the cost, but we're always looking to hear directly from the premier on ways we can make sure we're working together to benefit the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.""

Trudeau was also asked about the Atlantic Accord, as well as a replacement for the aging Her Majesty's Penitentiary. Again, Trudeau deferred to discussions with Premier Ball.

Their meeting convened at 1:45 p.m., with Trudeau scheduled to head to Toronto on Friday evening.

He flew in from Nova Scotia Thursday evening, and the trip to St. John's is, in part, a fundraising stop, as Canadians and politicians get ready to vote in an October federal election.

Though he will be talking with some provincial politicians, Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady has said she had ""no plans at this point"" to discuss the ongoing saga of Muskrat Falls — and any potential financial help from Ottawa — with the prime minister during his brief visit.

The decision paved the way for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's administration to increase fossil fuel emissions, endanger wildlife, and threaten the lives and livelihoods of the eight million people who live in the pipeline's path.

The NEB argued that the pipeline is in the public interest and provided the government with a list of 16 conditions that it must meet as it prepares to expand the 1,150 kilometer (714 mile) pipeline, tripling the amount of oil the tar sands pipeline will carry from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia—but critics including Burnaby mayor Mike Hurley argued that the NEB has no intention of protecting the environment or wildlife by enforcing strict regulations on the construction.

""This is the problem with drinking the Kool-Aid served by politicians who are masters of progressive symbolism but evade substance. Once in power, they can be counted on to do substantive harm."" —Naomi Klein

The conditions will not ""prevent significant public safety risks and harms to marine life and other environmental impacts,"" Hurley told the Vancouver Sun.

The board noted that the Trans Mountain pipeline is likely to have a significant negative impact on the Southern resident orca, whose population in the Salish Sea off the coast of British Columbia is rapidly dwindling; on the Indigenous population in the area, especially in the event of an oil spill; and on the environment, with fossil fuel emissions rising as cargo ships carry the oil after it travels from Edmonton.

Outcry from First Nations and campaigners ensued when the NEB initially approved the project in 2016, and opponents rejoiced last summer when the Federal Court of Appeals temporarily blocked construction. The court argued that Trudeau's administration and Kinder Morgan, which sold the pipeline to the government for $4.5 billion last year, had not sufficiently considered its effects on Southern orcas and indigenous tribes.

But Friday's approval—which came after what one campaigner called a rushed process with a ""compressed hearing schedule"" that allowed for little input from the public—was not unexpected among critics.

""This entire process is a joke,"" Peter McCartney of the Wilderness Committee told the Sun. ""I don't think anybody's surprised to see the NEB green lighting this pipeline—it's what they were designed to do.""

Kwikwasut'inuxw Haxwa'mis Chief Bob Chamberlin, vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said Trudeau has indicated his government will stop at nothing to complete the project.

""The troubling part for me and First Nations concerned about their water and their territories is the fact that Trudeau has stated this pipeline will be built, full stop. It makes an absolute mockery of the consultation process that was court ordered and has been accomplished today,"" Chamberlin told the Sun.

In a press conference, Grand Chief Stewart Philip also said indigenous tribes will not relent in their ""deeply entrenched opposition"" to the pipeline, which will threaten food sources of the 29 tribes that live in the path of the proposed route.

""We are proud British Columbians and we have a duty to protect what we've all been blessed with in British Columbia in regard to the pristine beauty of the environment,"" Philip said. ""We will rise to the challenge.""

""I understand in British Columbia, this pipeline will provide a way of having an income,"" said Noel Purser of the Suquamish Tribe, which joined four other Northwest U.S. tribes in challenging the project in 2013. ""But is it worth the potential of a spill, that risk? Is it really worth that? Because that will impact everybody, not just here in British Columbia. It will impact us in Suquamish; it will impact our relatives in Alaska.""

""Once again, Canada's NEB has sided with short-term Big Oil profits instead of the long-term health of the Pacific Northwest's people, climate and orcas,"" said Marcie Keever of Friends of the Earth. ""Shame on Prime Minister Trudeau, his government, and the National Energy Board of Canada for ignoring widespread opposition and serious concerns in favor of this destructive pipeline. Canada's decision will likely bring about the extinction of the Northwest's iconic killer whales and drive us further towards the brink of climate chaos.""

289,Empty,2019-02-22T12:05:27Z,WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft is emerging as the front-runner to be the next U.S. ambassador...,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft is emerging as the front-runner to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is backing Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They say President Donald Trump has been advised that Craft’s confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he is considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley.

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly under President George W. Bush’s administration. She is also friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her “longtime friendship and support” at her swearing-in as ambassador.

As U.S. ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump’s first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

Trump is also considering U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former U.S. Senate candidate John James of Michigan for the post.

Nauert’s weekend withdrawal from consideration came amid a push within the administration to fill the position given a pressing array of foreign policy concerns in which the United Nations, particularly the U.N. Security Council, is likely to play a significant role. From Afghanistan to Venezuela, the administration has pressing concerns that involve the world body, and officials said there had been impatience with the delays on Nauert’s formal nomination.

Trump said Dec. 7 that he would pick the former Fox News anchor and State Department spokeswoman for the U.N. job, but her nomination was never formalized.

Notwithstanding other concerns that may have arisen during her confirmation, Nauert’s nomination had languished in part due to the 35-day government shutdown that began Dec. 22 and interrupted key parts of the vetting process.

With Nauert out of the running, officials said Pompeo was keen on Craft to fill the position. Although Pompeo would like to see the job filled, the vacancy has created an opportunity for him and others to take on a more active role in U.N. diplomacy. On Thursday, for example, Pompeo was in New York to meet with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

Three other officials said both Pompeo and Bolton favor demoting the U.N. position to a sub-Cabinet level position, and Grenell has suggested he isn’t interested in a non-Cabinet role. The officials were not authorized to discuss internal personnel deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haley had been a member of the Cabinet and had clashed repeatedly with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others during the administration’s first 14 months.

Bolton was not a Cabinet member when he served as U.N. ambassador in President George W. Bush’s administration, and neither he nor Pompeo is eager to see a potential challenge to their foreign policy leadership in White House situation room meetings, according to the officials.

Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, describes Craft as warm and gracious and said she is often underestimated.

“She’s always, ‘Oh, you know, I’m not the policy expert.’ But she has a disarming quality. She’s not a policy intellectual, but she’s more emotionally astute and so I think she is more effective than she comes off,” Sands said.

""I totally respect his apology and also we shared some thoughts on ways to involve the youth, the upcoming generation,"" Trayvone Clayton told reporters at the Black Cultural Centre in Cherry Brook, N.S.

""This is not just for myself. I didn't do this for myself — I did it for all of us.""

Clayton, a Halifax university student, was part of a coalition of black, human rights, labour and youth groups that visited Parliament Hill on Feb. 4 for a series of meetings with eight federal cabinet ministers.

The visitors later reported that a government employee complained to the Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS) about them, taking their picture and referring to them as ""dark-skinned people.""

A member of the PPS who responded to the complaint also used the term ""dark-skinned"" and told them to leave the parliamentary cafeteria even though they had valid passes allowing them to be there, the group said.

Clayton said he was very hurt by the incident given they were invited to Ottawa to discuss ways of stopping hatred and racism toward black people.

""Look at this history. This has been here for hundreds of years and so racism still shouldn't be a problem towards us, we should be accepted for who we are and what we do,"" he said.

Kate MacDonald, a Halifax education and outreach co-ordinator, also welcomed the apology from Trudeau — the first sitting Canadian prime minister to visit the Black Cultural Centre.

""He said that he was sorry and he was deeply affected by what had happened and he recognizes that there is anti-black racism in Canada, that it is an issue that we're still trying to work through,"" said MacDonald, who described the mood inside the room during the private meeting as good.

MacDonald and Clayton said they look forward to discussions with the prime minister to talk about possible youth initiatives for black youth.

After the private apology and a tour of the cultural centre, Trudeau spoke to a large crowd of black community members and leaders, dignitaries and other invited guests.

The prime minister did not issue a public apology but acknowledged the wrong done.

As an MP and now prime minister, Trudeau said he gets to meet people from every corner of the country who come to the Parliament Buildings, which he described as impressive and intimidating stone buildings with ""paintings of white guys on the walls.""

""One of the first things I say to people is, 'This is your House. This is your House of Parliament. This is your building. This is where we serve you. This is your place,'"" Trudeau said.

""And to have these young [people] walk into their place for the first time, wanting to be part of ... conversations about their identity and what matters, and to have them smacked in the face with a stark reminder that anti-black racism exists, that unconscious bias exists, that systemic discrimination exists in this country today still, is not something we would want to be talking about this Black History Month.""

Trudeau acknowledged there is still much work to be done to combat racism in Canada.

""If it hadn't happened in Parliament, doesn't mean it wouldn't have happened anywhere else in this country on any given day, because it does,"" he said.

Big day today on Parliament Hill.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould is set to speak her truth about the SNC-Lavalin controversy this week—specifically, tomorrow,* when she appears before a justice committee that’s looking into whether the PMO tried to pressure her into going easy on SNC-Lavalin.

Will she light it up? If the former AG adds credible colour to the story being told by anonymous sources this past week, it will be a devastating day for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writes Andrew MacDougall: “If you’re Trudeau, it’s hard to envision an appearance in which Wilson-Raybould doesn’t burn everything—Trudeau included—to the ground. There has been some serious red-on-red action on the nation’s front pages in the past few days, and only one side can survive.” (Maclean’s)

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it. Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard? (Maclean’s)

Singh needs this win: Monday is also byelection day. Votes will be counted in three ridings, including Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Outremont in Montreal. But the one everyone will be watching is Burnaby South, where NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to finally secure a seat in the House. With his leadership in question, and the NDP low on polling and fundraising support, Singh needs victory—and the SNC-Lavalin mess embroiling Liberals can only help “(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” saysRichard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.” (Canadian Press, CBC News)

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.” (CBC News)

The NEB’s recommendation comes after the Canadian federal government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau purchased the pipeline from Kinder Morgan in May 2018 in an attempt to guarantee its construction. In August 2018 a Canadian federal appeals court ruled that the project would need a far more extensive environmental review and First Nations consultation before it could move forward. Despite a second “process” the NEB has made the same decision – to recommend approval of the pipeline expansion.

Marcie Keever, Friends of the Earth US’s oceans and vessels program director, issued the following statement in response:

Once again, Canada’s NEB has sided with short-term Big Oil profits instead of the long-term health of the Pacific Northwest’s people, climate and orcas. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion threatens the Salish Sea and its marine species, as well as the lives and livelihoods of the area’s 8 million people, including 29 Tribes and First Nations.

Shame on Prime Minister Trudeau, his government, and the National Energy Board of Canada for ignoring widespread opposition and serious concerns in favor of this destructive pipeline. Canada’s decision will likely bring about the extinction of the Northwest’s iconic killer whales and drive us further towards the brink of climate chaos.

Sign here to remind Justin Trudeau we won't let him build this pipeline, and to get updates as this struggle for climate justice continues.

The NEB’s new report focused on the impacts of marine shipping including on the highly endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, which was excluded from the original review. It was one of the 2 factors that caused the Federal Court of Appeal to quash the pipeline’s approvals and permits in their August 2018 ruling. The other was the inadequate consultation with affected First Nations, which the government says it is addressing through a new round of consultations that began in October.

The new report adds 16 conditions aiming to better protect marine life on the BC coast. It's delivery also starts the clock on a 90-day deadline for the cabinet to decide whether the controversial project will proceed. However, this is a deadline officials are already signalling could be pushed back.

The Federal Court of Appeal’s ruling happened a few months after the Trudeau Liberals made a deal for the federal government to buy the project from Texas-based Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion (though Kinder Morgan itself and independent estimates estimate the final costs to complete the project will total 7-15 billion or more).

Earlier this week, the National Energy Board (NEB) also rejected a motion supported by environmental groups, First Nations, municipal governments, and community groups to include climate impacts in its new review of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project (TMX). The motion was asking the NEB to adopt the same climate impact standards it had already adopted for Energy East, that were a key factor in TransCanada finally abandoning the project.

So where does this leave us?

As I said, this decision was widely expected. The NEB has a long history of siding with industry over communities, and the rushed process for this tacked-on review was not expected to come to any other conclusion.

The reconsideration process was widely criticized as inadequate due to its short 22 week timeline, the inaccessible and frankly bizarre decision to accept feedback only by fax, “surprise” public comment periods of only 2-7 days, and a very narrow scope of review and evidence.

The good news is that there is a giant wall of opposition of communities from coast to coast to coast that know it’s time for a just transition. This is why the TMX pipeline, like Energy East, Keystone XL, and Northern Gateway before it, and Line 3 currently, have faced years of delays or outright cancellations. We know we can’t afford the tripling in tar sands production they would help facilitate – for our climate, for Indigenous rights, for reliable jobs, or for our water.

Further court challenges will now be launched, as the federal government will need to show that their new consultations and recommendations adequately address the Federal Court of Appeal's concerns.

There is also a beautiful, diverse, widespread movement ready to use lots of different tactics to stop this pipeline from being built. Some of the most exciting strategis on the horizon are those that are marrying the strong ‘no’ to new fossil fuels with the future with a liveable climate, Indigenous rights, and good work that we want to see. The Tiny House Warriors are building ten houses on the pipeline's path in Secwepemc territory to assert jurisdiciton, block access to the pipeline, and model the kinds of solutions to their nation's housing crisis that they want to see scaled up. And Climate Justice Edmonton's ""People on the Path"" project is shifting the narrative that all Albertans are pro-pipeline by showcasing different communities' visions for a just transition in 8 foot portraits to be installed along the route.

The National Energy Board of Canada has renewed its backing for an 895,00 barrels-a-day oil pipeline, even while acknowledging it will have ""significantly adverse environmental effects"" on endangered southern resident killer whales.

A major pipeline or oil tanker spill is unlikely, but the ""effects would be significant,"" Robert Steedman, the Board's chief environmental officer, told a briefing in Calgary.

The orcas are, in essence, being told to take one for the team. The Board found the $9.3 billion (Canadian) pipeline would bring ""considerable benefits"" across the country.

""While these effects weighed heavily on the NEB's consideration of project-related marine shipping, the NEB recommends that the government of Canada find that they can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits of the project and measures to minimize the effects,"" the recommendation said.

RELATED: Orca protection must be part of Canadian pipeline -- energy board

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee shot back: ""Now is the time to protect our orcas and combat climate change, not invest in long-term fossil fuel infrastructure.""

The 650-mile, Alberta-to-British Columbia project would bring the TransMountain Pipeline to a terminus at Burnaby, just east of Vancouver. The oil would not be for B.C., but export to global, especially Pacific, markets.

Thirty-four tankers a month, laden with bitumen crude from the Alberta tar sands, would traverse sensitive marine waters of the Salish Sea.

The tankers would pass through Burrard Inlet and English Bay in Vancouver, then move to Haro Strait which separates the San Juan and Gulf islands -- and is a major feeding area for the orcas. They would exit through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The tanker route passes popular, beloved places -- San Juan, Stuart, Speiden, Sucia and Patos islands in the San Juans, as well as Dungeness Spit on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and, Cape Flattery, Shi Shi Beach and Point of Arches off the mouth of the Strait.

The tanker route is bounded by national parks in both the United States and Canada. Both Inslee and B.C. Premier John Horgan have opposed the project, fearful of tanker spills and harm to the southern resident killer whales.

""We need to stop the bleeding right now: We can't be adding a pipeline and increasing tanker traffic at a time when we need to be assessing and repairing that we already have been doing,"" said Raynell Thomas of the Lummi Nation, which intervened in the National Energy Board deliberation.

A Canadian appeals court ordered the Board to review an earlier decision, approving the pipeline, because it had failed to give attention to impacts on marine mammals, and had not heard out Canada's Aboriginal First Nations.

The Board found that waters of the Salish Sea are ""already highly disturbed,"" with conditions ""already detrimental"" to the orcas.

It delivered 16 new marine safety recommendations, such as calling on B.C. ferry boats to make less noise as they cross the Strait of Georgia.

""The (Board) panel feels strongly that if these recommendations are implemented, they will offset the relatively minor effects of project-related marine traffic and in fact will benefit the entire Salish Sea ecosystem,"" Steedman said.

ALSO FROM CONNELLY: $655 million in the form of a polar icebreaker for a changing Arctic

The benefits, cited by the Board, include giving Alberta oil access to new markets, additional government revenue, jobs and economic activity.

In a very different view, Christianne Wilhelmson of the Georgia Strait Alliance said:

""The NEB's recommendation relies on oil spill planning that's based on unscientific hope that diluted bitumen (oil) won't sink into our coastal waters. Weather and sea conditions on the proposed tanker route often make it impossible to respond to an oil spill.""

A 1988 barge spill of Grays Harbor dumped 230,000 gallons of oil into the ocean. The oil eventually fouled beaches of both Olympic National Park in the United States, and Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island.

""How can you argue these impacts are justified at all, let alone based on a dying industry doomed to fail?,"" asked Peter McCartney of the Wilderness Committee, a leading Canadian environmental group.

The final decision on the pipeline, barring more court challenges, rests with the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau got the recommendation he wants. The Prime Minister has already endorsed the pipeline, and gone a giant step further.

The Canadian government purchased the pipeline project last year when its Houston-based builder, Kinder Morgan, hinted at a pullout.

But Premier Horgan struck a note of defiance, and said that the economy of the Salish Sea should not be thrown under 34 oil tankers a month.

""We will continue to stand up for B.C. and defend our environment,"" Horgan tweeted, ""the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on it & southern resident orcas from the risk of an oil spill.""",Canada's energy board: Build pipeline that hurts endangered killer whales,Seattlepi.com,https://www.seattlepi.com/local/politics/article/Canada-s-energy-board-Build-pipeline-that-hurts-13637504.php

Later, in a short speech to a small group of party donors at a St. John’s hotel, Trudeau pointed to such projects as essential planning for the future, as anxieties grow about disappearing jobs and a changing work landscape. “Our investments in science, in research, in higher education, in artificial intelligence and robotics, these are the things that potentially are a source of anxiety for folks who are wondering that the world is passing them by, and maybe there won’t be jobs for them or their kids in the future,” Trudeau said. “We’re showing that Canadians ... can be and are at the heart of this new economy we are building.”

Trudeau fielded reporters’ questions on the evolving SNC-Lavalin affair but mostly deflected questions on local issues, including the federal loan guarantee for the Labrador hydro megaproject and the need for a new prison in St. John’s. He later met with Premier Dwight Ball, who said they were continuing “many discussions we’ve had in the past.”

Among the key bilateral issues are Ottawa’s Bill C-69, which would set stricter rules for environmental assessments of energy projects, which Ball said is causing uncertainty for possible investors in the province’s offshore oil and mining industries. Talks have also been ongoing regarding a review of the 2005 Atlantic Accord, an agreement on managing revenues from offshore resources. Ball has previously stated his intentions to talk with the prime minister on the topic before the accord’s review period is up at the end of March. In a statement after the meeting, Ball said he spoke with Trudeau about Muskrat Falls and electricity rates and unspecified “social issues.” They also discussed a federal-provincial inquiry into the treatment of Innu children in care. In his speech to donors, Trudeau asked the people of the province to keep faith in his government for four more years and promised a listening ear to Canadians worried about their futures. “People around the world are mistrustful of their institutions, worried that they are not being supported in the transformations in the world around them,” Trudeau said. “What we’re doing here in Canada is reinforcing faith in institutions and demonstrating that yes, government shouldn’t do (everything) but ... the things it can do, it should do very well.” Trudeau was in Halifax on Wednesday and Thursday, where he announced up to $86.5-million to improve an expressway into the city and visited the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia.

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick said a Sept. 17, 2018, meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould, which has emerged as a key event in the SNC-Lavalin affair, was actually in response to cabinet tensions over the direction of the promised recognition and implementation of an Indigenous rights framework.

The framework was meant to enshrine the Constitution's section 35, which affirms Aboriginal rights, in federal law, allowing First Nations to reconstitute their governance structures outside the Indian Act. Trudeau announced the framework during a speech in the House of Commons in February 2018.

Wernick said the prime minister met with Wilson-Raybould to discuss ""very serious policy differences"" between the former justice minister, Bennett and other ministers over the framework.

""He was aware because he had been briefed both by the Privy Council Office and his political staff that there was something of a policy standoff among his ministers,"" said Wernick during testimony before the justice committee, Thursday.

""There were different views on a very significant thing. And we were trying to find a way, essentially I would call it a form of conciliation or mediation, to bring people together.""

The committee is holding hearings into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which were triggered by a Globe and Mail report that alleged Wilson-Raybould was pressured by the PMO to intervene in the criminal prosecution of the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould is expected to testify next week.

Wernick said that he took the lead on the Indigenous framework file because Trudeau and senior PMO officials were consumed by trade negotiations with the U.S.

He said Trudeau was growing ""impatient"" in September with the slow pace of work on the framework, which was then facing a nascent organized resistance that echoed the early days of the Idle No More movement.

""He was concerned we were losing momentum and traction heading into the last year of the mandate on the rights framework,"" said Wernick.

Trudeau, Wernick and Wilson-Raybould's meeting on Sept. 17, 2018, came about a week after the Assembly of First Nations held a forum to discuss the framework. The forum turned disastrous for the federal government after Crown-Indigenous Relations officials released a draft discussion paper that was widely panned by First Nations leaders as ""insulting,"" boosting grassroots opposition to the initiative.

AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde said in a Sept. 11 speech during the forum that the Trudeau government, which wanted to introduce the framework by the fall, needed to slow down the process.

First Nations leaders wanted Wilson-Raybould to lead file

In a speech at the University of Saskatchewan on Sept. 13, Wilson-Raybould seemed to take a swipe at the discussion paper on the rights framework produced by Bennett's department.

""But words are also easy, cheap ... too often we see the tendency — especially in politics — to use important words that have real meaning and importance, carelessly,"" said Wilson-Raybould, according to a transcript of her speech.

""We see 'recognition' applied to ideas that actually maintain 'denial.' We see 'self-government' used to refer to ideas or processes that actually maintain control over others.""

A month earlier, in late August, high-profile First Nations leaders and legal experts wrote a letter to Trudeau calling for a reset of how Bennett was handling the co-development process for the framework.

The letter stated a preference for dealing with Wilson-Raybould to place the process on ""the proper path.""

Bennett had led the engagement process with Indigenous groups across the country following Trudeau's speech in the House of Commons on Feb. 14, 2018 announcing the framework.

Bennett was caught up in a mini-scandal that July during the AFN election in Vancouver — where the framework became a campaign issue — after she met with Alberta chiefs on the same morning ballots were being cast for the next national chief.

Wernick said the Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould marked the beginning of the end of efforts to table the framework that fall. He said the issue was then referred to the cabinet sub-committee on reconciliation and later to cabinet.

""There was a decision not to proceed with the rights and recognition framework,"" he said.

CBC News reported in mid-November that the framework would not be tabled.

Wernick said cabinet had decided to focus on the promised Indigenous languages legislation, which was tabled in late January, and Indigenous child welfare legislation, which has yet to be put on the notice paper.

First Nation drummers pound out a song during a rally on Parliament Hill on Dec. 4, 2018, held to protest the framework. (Jorge Barrera/CBC)

On Nov. 29, Wilson-Raybould delivered a speech in Vancouver where she expressed frustration with the resistance she faced within government in her push for Indigenous rights.

""Within government, when discussing matters of Indigenous rights, one still often finds a seeming disproportionate focus on 'risk' — speculation that the sky may fall,"" Wilson-Raybould said, according to a transcript of the speech.

Wilson-Raybould didn't want to be 'Indian Agent'

Bennett's office, referring to a December 2018 statement on the issue, indicated that the government is still committed to getting the framework ""right,"" while pushing other policy changes.

In his testimony, Wernick praised Bennett and defended her against ""vile"" social media criticisms.

""I am deeply hurt on behalf of Minister Bennett that her reputation has been trolled over the last little while,"" said Wernick. ""There has been no Canadian who has worked harder on Indigenous reconciliation than the honourable Carolyn Bennett.""

Wernick also denied a Globe and Mail report that said he privately rebuked Wilson-Raybould over her speeches on Indigenous rights.

""I am telling you, it didn't happen,"" he said.

Wernick said he has known Wilson-Raybould for 15 years and considered her a ""partner, ally and friend."" He said Wilson-Raybould never wanted to take on any Indigenous affairs roles in cabinet because she didn't want to be the ""Indian agent"" over her people.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is backing Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They say President Donald Trump has been advised that Craft’s confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he is considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley.

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly under President George W. Bush’s administration. She is also friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her “longtime friendship and support” at her swearing-in as ambassador.

As U.S. ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump’s first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

Trump is also considering U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former U.S. Senate candidate John James of Michigan for the post.

Nauert’s weekend withdrawal from consideration came amid a push within the administration to fill the position given a pressing array of foreign policy concerns in which the United Nations, particularly the U.N. Security Council, is likely to play a significant role. From Afghanistan to Venezuela, the administration has pressing concerns that involve the world body, and officials said there had been impatience with the delays on Nauert’s formal nomination.

Trump said Dec. 7 that he would pick the former Fox News anchor and State Department spokeswoman for the U.N. job, but her nomination was never formalized. Notwithstanding other concerns that may have arisen during her confirmation, Nauert’s nomination had languished in part due to the 35-day government shutdown that began Dec. 22 and interrupted key parts of the vetting process.

With Nauert out of the running, officials said Pompeo was keen on Craft to fill the position. Although Pompeo would like to see the job filled, the vacancy has created an opportunity for him and others to take on a more active role in U.N. diplomacy. On Thursday, for example, Pompeo was in New York to meet with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

Three other officials said both Pompeo and Bolton favor demoting the U.N. position to a sub-Cabinet level position, and Grenell has suggested he isn’t interested in a non-Cabinet role. The officials were not authorized to discuss internal personnel deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haley had been a member of the Cabinet and had clashed repeatedly with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others during the administration’s first 14 months. Bolton was not a Cabinet member when he served as U.N. ambassador in President George W. Bush’s administration, and neither he nor Pompeo is eager to see a potential challenge to their foreign policy leadership in White House situation room meetings, according to the officials.

Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, describes Craft as warm and gracious and said she is often underestimated.

“She’s always, ‘Oh, you know, I’m not the policy expert.’ But she has a disarming quality. She’s not a policy intellectual, but she’s more emotionally astute and so I think she is more effective than she comes off,” Sands said.

Craft is married to billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they are major Republican donors.

Craft has been ambassador during a low point in relations. Last year Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weak and dishonest, words that shocked Canadians.

299,Empty,2019-02-22T15:31:58Z,The inaugural FP500/Forum Research Business Barometer poll reveals perception in Corporate Canada that we gave up a lot to get little,"It took Canada 17 months of grinding, teeth-gnashing, often round-the-clock negotiations to hammer out a new trilateral trade deal with the United States and Mexico, but that doesn’t mean Canadian business leaders have warmed to it.

Half the executives surveyed for the inaugural FP500/Forum Research Business Barometer poll say they think the original North American Free Trade Agreement was better for the Canadian economy.

“The perception is that there were a lot of concessions made to the U.S. on dairy, on drug patents and things like that,” said Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research. “People are sensitive to those concessions and I don’t know that there was enough promotion of the deal’s benefits. So we gave up this, but what did we get? And I don’t think it’s enough to say it could have been a lot worse.”

The survey of 48 randomly selected executives of FP500 companies took a broad look at subjects ranging from emerging technology to the #MeToo movement and cannabis legalization. Trade, however, was a big area of concern.

A little more than half (52 per cent) of the executives said they viewed the 24-year-old NAFTA deal as better for the economy than the new deal, branded the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, by U.S. President Donald Trump. Just five per cent believed the new agreement was better for the economy, while a third of respondents viewed the two deals as the same.

Asked to evaluate just the USMCA’s effect on the Canadian economy, nearly 40 per cent said it would be positive, while 36 per cent believed it would be negative.

“It’s possible that what they are saying is that NAFTA is technically a better agreement than the USMCA, but, at the end of the day, it’s not going to make much difference overall,” Bozinoff said.

A range of factors, including exchange rate fluctuations, fiscal policy changes, shifting consumer preferences and offshore competition make measuring the economic value of a trade deal “a very hard thing to do,” said Robert Wolfe, professor emeritus at Queen’s University’s School of Policy Studies in Kingston, Ont.

The maturity of both the U.S. market and the U.S.-Canada free-trade relationship also means any impact from a revamped deal is bound to be “incremental,” he added.

“When business looks at USMCA versus NAFTA, the real thing to consider is USMCA versus nothing,” Wolfe said. “Nothing would have real impacts on productivity and efficiency, because anything that disrupts North American supply chains can’t be good.”

Many of the new elements in the USMCA draw heavily on the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 11-country Asia-Pacific free trade deal abandoned by the Trump administration in 2016. Among the similar elements are stronger intellectual property protections, new labour and environment obligations, and rules for digital trade and e-commerce.

Some of the biggest changes were in the automotive industry, where new minimum wage and regional content requirements were established. Higher de minimis thresholds or duty free limits for online shopping, which were fought by Canadian retailers — are also part of the agreement.

“It’s a mixed bag as with any trade deal,” Wolfe said. “Some people will win, some people won’t. It doesn’t surprise me that some (executives) see it as a little better, some see it as a little worse. Because the truth is, that’s about right.”

Despite volatile negotiations in which Trump officials publicly criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the U.S. slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, almost three quarters of executives surveyed (70 per cent) said they saw the U.S. as a reliable trading partner, with 27 per cent describing it as “very reliable.” About 20 per cent said the U.S. was not reliable.

What’s more, half the executives said the amount of U.S. business they do had stayed the same over the past six months while 18 per cent said it grew, suggesting the strained relations between Canada and the U.S. had little impact on established trade flows.

And though the federal government has renewed efforts to diversify trade, the uncertainty of the negotiations drove only 23 per cent to look for trade opportunities outside the U.S.

It’s a mixed bag as with any trade deal. Some people will win, some people won't Robert Wolfe, professor emeritus at Queen’s University’s School of Policy Studies

“North America is a mature economy. A good portion of our businesses should be looking for diversification into higher-growth regions like Asia and increasingly Africa,” said Dan Ciuriak, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

Through rules of origin requirements and other measures, the new trade agreement is “designed to fence in activity into North America,” he said, adding that other features still favour production inside U.S. borders.

“The place to look for the impact of the new NAFTA is not in trade directly, but in investment,” Ciuriak said. “The uncertainty about future market access into the United States promises to lower foreign direct investment aiming to serve the North American market coming to Canada.”

The finance department released budget figures Friday that showed revenue up 8.7 per cent in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, well above the 4.9 per cent projected by the government in November. If that pace holds up, revenue for the year that ends March 31 would be almost $10 billion (Canadian) more than projected.

The numbers suggest Trudeau may have more fiscal space to dangle new program spending in the next budget, due to be unveiled March 19, or accelerate the pace of planned deficit reduction if he chooses. The assumption up to now has been that he had little wiggle room after Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s November announcement of $14 billion in new corporate tax breaks. “If you are the finance minister that’s great news,” said Kevin Page, head of the University of Ottawa’s Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy. The question is whether the government sees this is a temporary bump or a permanent increase in tax yields that would allow it to roll the better revenue picture into the future, Page said. “Whether they carry it forward or not will it be fiscally significant.”

Soft Patch One reason for circumspection is that the economy appeared to enter a soft patch at the end of last year, which could considerably slow revenue growth in coming months. Morneau, asked about the stronger fiscal numbers at a press conference Friday in Toronto, said his government would remain cautious. Morneau’s last fiscal update in November projected an $18.1 billion deficit for the current fiscal year, on revenue of $328.9 billion. The figures released Friday showed revenue of $241 billion in the first nine months, 73 per cent of target. This time last year, the federal government had only reached 71 per cent of its full-year revenue target. The data also show Canada produced a surplus of $324 million in the first nine months of the fiscal year, versus an $8.9 billion deficit for the same period last year. The stronger numbers reflect much stronger-than-expected tax collection from both corporations and individuals, in part due to an acceleration in new job growth over the past 18 months. It’s not uncommon for government tax yields to rise at the late stages of business cycles when unemployment is low, but the sharp increase seems to have caught the government by surprise. Program expenses, meanwhile, have grown at about the projected pace.",Tax windfalls leave Trudeau more room to spend ahead of election,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/22/tax-windfalls-leave-trudeau-more-room-to-spend-ahead-of-election.html
303,Empty,2019-02-22T09:00:00Z,"Michael Wernick, Canada's top bureaucrat, testified before the Commons justice committee Thursday, saying he did not inappropriately pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to cut a legal deal with the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin —…","Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Canada's top bureaucrat, testified before the Commons justice committee Thursday, saying he did not inappropriately pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to cut a legal deal with the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin — although he did warn her of the consequences of prosecuting the criminal charges.

More than any other government player said to be involved in this ballooning controversy, Wernick spoke in clear terms about what he saw happening inside the machinery of government as the federal Liberals grappled with the file.

In 2015, the Mounties laid corruption and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin over allegations it used bribery to secure government contracts in Libya.

In an effort to avoid a criminal trial, SNC-Lavalin lobbied a cross-section of cabinet ministers, MPs, senators, senior bureaucrats and premiers, asking that some sort of remediation agreement be reached that would allow it to avoid a criminal conviction. A conviction would exclude the firm from bidding on future government contracts for up to 10 years — which could financially cripple the company and threaten its continued viability.

Here are five things we learned from Wernick's testimony:

1. Wernick takes aim at Globe story

Earlier this month, on Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail published the initial report that claimed Wilson-Raybould was pressured to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — with SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, have denied any wrongdoing.

Wernick said Thursday that he thought the Globe's reporting on the matter was inaccurate.

""I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,"" he said.

The article — citing unnamed, anonymous sources — said that Trudeau's senior aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the high-profile justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

‘I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,’ Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, said. 5:31

While there was much debate inside government about what should be done about the criminal allegations, Wernick repeatedly denied Thursday the claim Trudeau, or officials in the PMO, exerted inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould to cut the company some slack.

""We are discussing lawful advocacy that the minister take a lawful decision, which in the end she did not take,"" he told the justice committee.

""What Canadians need to know is that, despite a massive government relations effort, meetings with MPs, staffers, leaders of the opposition, paid advertising, pressure put through two premiers of Quebec, they didn't get what they wanted. If it's a movie, it's a flop.""

2. The September meeting

On Sept. 4, the prosecution service told SNC-Lavalin, in writing, that it would not negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — paving the way for a trial on the matter at a later date.

Wernick said that in a Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould — which the clerk said was principally called to attend to another matter before cabinet, namely the drafting of a new framework on Indigenous rights — the SNC-Lavalin matter was raised.

He corroborated the prime minister's account of the meeting.

As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could overrule the prosecution service, directing it to negotiate an agreement with the company.

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould asked him that day if he planned to tell her what to do — and he said he told her that any decision on the matter was hers alone to make.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

The next day, on Sept. 18, SNC-Lavalin representatives met with Wernick. The clerk said he doesn't remember the substance of the conversation or whether the representatives told him that the public prosecution service had denied a request for a DPA.

On Feb. 12, a week after the Globe and Mail story broke, Wilson-Raybould resigned her cabinet position. Trudeau said he was surprised and disappointed that she quit cabinet, adding that if she felt undue pressure in her role as attorney general, she had a duty to report it to him.

3. Solicitor-client privilege doesn't apply: Wernick

Wilson-Raybould has so far refused to speak publicly about what transpired on the SNC-Lavalin file, saying only that solicitor-client privilege stemming from her time as justice minister forbids her from commenting.

Wernick said Thursday that, while he's not a lawyer, he doesn't believe she should be constrained from telling her side of the story because solicitor-client privilege simply doesn't apply in this case.

""My conclusion, as someone who spends a lot of time in governance ... I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,"" Wernick said.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

""The prime minister said at every occasion verbally and in writing that she was the decider, so she was not giving legal advice to the prime minister. She was the decider — the full and final decider.""

Wernick added that the matter was never discussed in cabinet and thus, in his opinion, she is also not bound by cabinet confidentiality.

""There was never, never, never a cabinet conversation about the prosecution,"" he said.

4. Wernick warned Wilson-Raybould about the 'consequences'

Wernick revealed Thursday that, in a Dec. 19 phone call with Wilson-Raybould, he did warn of the consequences of not moving ahead with a DPA for SNC-Lavalin.

He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

""Part of my conversations ... was conveying context — that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, the consequences for the workers and the communities and the suppliers,"" he said.

SNC-Lavalin is a major firm, a pillar of corporate Canada, and employs more than 9,000 people across the country, including 3,400 in Quebec, 3,000 in Ontario and just over 1,000 in B.C.

The SNC-Lavalin headquarters is seen in Montreal on Tuesday, February 12, 2019. Debt rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the company Tuesday, citing diplomatic tensions and criminal charges against the beleaguered engineering giant as among the financial headwinds buffeting a firm now swept up in a political firestorm. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

The company, which is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is widely held by Canadian shareholders, including many of the largest pension plans and mutual funds.

""There's pressure to get it right on every decision. To approve, to not approve, to act, to not act. I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it right,"" Wernick said.

""There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister — at any time.""

In the end, he said, the matter may boil down to an interpretation of what constitutes 'pressure'.

""I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what's lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context. She may have another view of the conversation, but that's something the ethics commissioner could sort out,"" he said.

5. Wilson-Raybould never wanted an Indigenous portfolio

While Wilson-Raybould disagreed vehemently with Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on how best to pursue the implementation of a new Indigenous rights framework, she herself never wanted to hold any of the Indigenous cabinet positions, Wernick said.

""She played a very particular role in cabinet. She did not ever want to be the Indigenous affairs minister. She didn't want to be the Indigenous Services or [Crown-Indigenous Relations] minister, and be the Indian agent for her own people,"" he said.",What we learned from Canada's top bureaucrat about the SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-five-things-michael-wernick-snc-lavalin-1.5028922
304,Empty,2019-02-25T14:09:25Z,Canadian minister signalled that his government may not ratify a new North American trade agreement if the duties remain,"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he’s working to remove U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, after a Canadian minister signalled that his government may not ratify a new North American trade agreement if the duties remain.

Kudlow made the comments on a panel at the National Governors Association’s winter meeting in Washington on Sunday. He spoke after Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said “I don’t know if we are going to get there” in approving the deal if the tariffs aren’t removed.

The duties are no longer needed now that the two countries and Mexico have agreed on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, Garneau said. Kudlow also suggested that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working toward having the tariffs removed.

“Ambassador Lighthizer and his group, we are working on that, we are hard at work on that, to solve that issue,” Kudlow said of the metals tariffs after Garneau spoke. Earlier in the panel discussion, Kudlow said the new three-nation agreement was “very strong” and that Trump taught him tariffs can be a good negotiating tactic to break down trade barriers.

Canada retaliated dollar-for-dollar against U.S. tariffs last year, and Garneau’s comments on Sunday were some of the sharpest about the dispute since then as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau leads his government toward an October election. Garneau said that while political energy may shift to other issues in coming months, the tariffs alone are a major stumbling block to ratification.

‘Unnecessary Tax’

“Those tariffs are an unnecessary tax which is weighing down on both countries,” said Garneau, a former astronaut who served on U.S.-led space missions. He also said the original U.S. justification for tariffs on national security grounds was never justified.

“This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada — I don’t know if we are going to get there,” Garneau said.

Canada would quickly drop its metals tariffs and ratify the agreement in response to a U.S. move, Garneau said. “We want to go ahead and do it because this is very good for both of our countries,” Garneau said of ratifying the trade agreement.

Garneau appealed to the governors in the audience to push the Trump administration to drop the tariffs, noting that Canada is the top export market for many U.S. states. The U.S. also has a US$2 billion surplus in steel trade with Canada, and the bilateral deficit on aluminum is because America needs more of that metal than it can produce, Garneau said.

Letter to Ross

Mexican officials have also called for the metal tariffs to be removed, and a coalition of business, agricultural and trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter in January asking the same of Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Kudlow touted the new trade agreement on Sunday before Garneau spoke, saying it was a “template” for other pacts and would bring US$62 billion of auto investment to the U.S. Such agreements are better than broad, multilateral trade pacts that sink to the “lowest common denominator,” Kudlow said.

And so, on a frosty Ottawa morning, Wilson-Raybould and her former chief of staff, Jessica Prince, walked into the prime minister's West Block offices for a private meeting with Justin Trudeau, his chief of staff, Katie Telford, and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

It was the morning after Gerald Butts had publicly announced his resignation as Trudeau's principal secretary. The very apex of the Liberal government was reeling — and now Wilson-Raybould wanted to walk into the cabinet room a week after she had walked out of cabinet.

Her pitch was simple. She wanted to explain her side of the SNC-Lavalin affair to the inner circle she had quit on February 12.

Trudeau eventually agreed to bring her request to the full cabinet. Ministers debated the matter for two hours while Wilson-Raybould waited outside.

Multiple sources tell CBC News that some cabinet ministers were concerned about the optics of letting Wilson-Raybould attend a meeting of the inner circle just a week after she'd quit cabinet.

They eventually consented to Wilson-Raybould's unprecedented appearance but — as Wernick revealed in his extraordinary testimony before the Commons justice committee this week — Attorney General David Lametti left the cabinet room to avoid any potential conflict.

No apologies

Sources described WIlson-Raybould as unapologetic during her cabinet room appearance. People inside the room, and those later briefed on the conversation, confirm that Wilson-Raybould told the cabinet she felt she had been pressured improperly to help SNC-Lavalin, something first reported by the Globe and Mail.

Jody Wilson-Raybould has been clear that she's ready to tell her side of the story in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. But what's standing in her way? Salimah Shiviji explains the complex situation. <a href=""https://t.co/3s9tAGs1Ma"">pic.twitter.com/3s9tAGs1Ma</a> —@CBCTheNational

The specifics of what Wilson-Raybould said in cabinet were not shared with CBC News, but Wernick's testimony likely shed some light on what was said. The clerk typically attends cabinet meetings, and Wernick was at this one.

""I predict that the former attorney-general will express concern to this committee about three events. The first is the meeting with the prime minister,"" Wernick told MPs on the justice committee Thursday.

""The second is a conversation between the Prime Minister's Office staff and her former chief of staff when she was minister of justice on Dec 18. And the third is a conversation that I had with her in the afternoon of Dec. 19.""

Wernick's testimony was a broad defence of the conduct of the government he serves. His arguments have done nothing to resolve the partisan debate surrounding the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

But that particular bit of testimony helped clarify the timeline of the key fracture points that led to Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet and Butts' departure as the prime minister's top adviser.

What did the staffers say?

Wernick corroborated the prime minister's account of the Sept. 17 meeting with Wilson-Raybould. He said Trudeau asked for the meeting to discuss the slow pace of legislation central to the government's Indigenous reconciliation agenda. When Wilson-Raybould asked Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin, Wernick said, the PM assured his then-attorney general that any decision was hers to make.

​""He indicated that it was entirely her call to make, that she was the decider,"" Wernick testified. ""And that is a message the PM conveyed to the minister on every situation that I'm aware of that came up.""

There were no politicians at the Dec. 18 meeting — just political staff. A senior government official confirms the meeting was between Prince, Butts and Telford.

There has been no public account of this meeting, but a source tells CBC News that whatever transpired is crucial to Wilson-Raybould's argument that she was improperly pressured.

If that's the case, then Wernick's call to Wilson-Raybould the very next day would have been especially unwelcome.

""I conveyed to her that a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious,"" Wernick said to the committee. ""There were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, the consequences for the (SNC-Lavalin) workers and the communities and the suppliers.""

Many senior Liberals feel Wernick did a good job of defending the government's conduct in the SNC-Lavalin controversy. They argue the clerk was able to do what the prime minister should have done from the beginning: lay out, in plain language, the case for significant government action to protect 9,000 SNC-Lavalin jobs while also respecting the rule of law.

Others aren't so sure. CBC News has learned that, when a group of cabinet ministers met for a regular gathering at Environment Minister Catherine McKenna's Ottawa Centre home on Thursday night, one of the issues they discussed was an assessment of the fallout from Wernick's testimony.

A 'strong basis' for investigation

Some critics have described Wernick's comments as overly partisan. The Conservatives suggest they form the basis of a police investigation.

​""There is certainly a strong basis to be made for an RCMP investigation,"" Conservative MP Michael Cooper said Friday. ""I think that what the evidence of Mr. Wernick before the justice committee confirms is that the allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC Lavalin are supported.""

Meanwhile, Liberal backbenchers remain largely in the dark about the specifics of what happened — and what might happen next.

Several Liberal MPs told CBC News they are convinced Wilson-Raybould is determined to bring down the prime minister and this entire controversy is a way to settle scores over being demoted to Veterans Affairs. They hold that view even though Wilson-Raybould assured the Liberal caucus on Wednesday that she was on the Liberal team and supports the Liberal agenda.

Other caucus members believe her motives are more personal than that. They praise Wilson-Raybould as extremely principled while also criticizing her as rigid.

Only Wilson-Raybould herself can say for sure. She'll get that chance when she testifies at the justice committee next week. It still isn't clear whether the questions about how solicitor-client privilege applies to her will be resolved before her appearance.

Wilson-Raybould kept notes

What is clear is that she has an important story to tell — and it is likely to be well-documented. Multiple government sources say Wilson-Raybould is a prodigious note-taker, making copious written accounts of nearly every meeting she attends.

When she resigned from cabinet, multiple sources say, the Prime Minister's Office did a thorough vet of their own notes and records to see if there was anything that could cause them trouble. Wernick argued in his testimony that no one in PMO crossed a line

""So, I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,"" Wernick said.

At this point, it seems unlikely that Wilson-Raybould would agree.",Under pressure: Inside an explosive week in the SNC-Lavalin controversy,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/snc-lavalin-wilson-raybould-trudeau-wernick-1.5030928

Canada: Scandal Involving P.M. Justin Trudeau Linked to Libya: The cesspool of romancing Jihad.

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Four years ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officially leveled corruption and fraud charges against Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, over alleged criminal acts that occurred while that firm was doing business in Libya. The Globe and Mail broke the biggest scandal since Canadas Adscam scandal, which cost the Liberals dearly in election year 2006. This latest scandal, also breaking in an election year, has to do with the involvement of Justin Trudeau and the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in the SNC-Lavalin case.

SNC-Lavalin operates in a variety of sectors globally, including mining and metallurgy, oil and gas, and the fraud and corruption charges against it include nearly $48 million in payments made to Libyan government officials between 2001 and 2011.

The case centers around Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould (JWR), who served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada from 2015 until January 2019. She was then demoted in a cabinet shuffle to the position of Minister of Veterans Affairs, and suddenly resigned several days ago (February 12) following the Globe and Mail report, which alleged that the PMO attempted to press her to intervene in the corruption and fraud prosecution of SNC-Lavalin in her role as Attorney General, in order to spare the engineering giant  deemed to be a crown jewel in Quebec  from criminal prosecution. The story also indicated that she came under heavy pressure.

Now the Commons Justice Committee will look into whether JWR was subjected to any kind of pressure from Trudeau and/or the PMO. Meanwhile, Trudeaus principal secretary, Gerald Butts, has suddenly quit. Butts is Trudeaus longtime friend, confidante and confidence booster, and some even say that Butts is his brains. Trudeau calls Butts the core of his inner circle. The resignation was over the SNC affair. Criminal charges could also be laid against members of the PMO for obstruction of justice, if its interference is established.

Doing Business with a Jihadist Government:

There is another twist in the criminal case involving SNC Lavalin, and the alleged involvement by Justin Trudeau and the PMO: Libya.

Between 2001 and 2011, a senior executive of SNC-Lavalin established close ties with Saadi Gaddafi, the son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The RCMP alleged that as the presidents son, Saadi Gaddafi was in a position of power and able to give a business advantage to SNC-Lavalin in Libya, and that he was a major recipient of SNCs largesse. Court documents allege that the company offered bribes worth $47.7 million to one or several public officials of the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin was allegedly busy defrauding Libyan public agencies of approximately 129.8 million. Charges were laid by the RCMP against SNC executive Sami Bebawi and a former SNC executive vice president, Riadh Ben Aissa, who pleaded guilty to charges of corruption and money laundering relating to SNC-Lavalins Libyan operation. Aissa has since been extradited to Canada.

It has also been claimed that SNC paid for lavish trips and more for relatives of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and even had some on payroll to ensure they got lucrative contracts.

Saadi Gaddafi also has other unsavory personal baggage. He was acquitted last year of murdering Bashir al-Rayani, former footballer and coach of Tripolis Al-Ittihad football club. But now Bashirs family intends to appeal Gaddafis acquittal, because they say we could not get justice under his fathers regime, we will get it now, Im confident!

Some more background about the Libyan regime that SNC was allegedly wheeling and dealing with: Muammar Gaddafi seized power in Libya in a military coup detat in 1969. He was known for horrific human rights abuses, a supporter of jihad terror, fervently Islamic and pro‐Palestine, and once stated: Christianity is not a faith for people in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Other people who are not sons of Israel have nothing to do with that religion .all those believers who do not follow Islam are losers ..We are here to correct the mistakes in the light of the teachings of the Koran. Gaddafi also declared that Iranians are our brothers and fed into the victimology narrative that America was the great oppressor.

So here is the Canadian government involved not only in possible obstruction of justice, but also in trying to cover up the links of SNC-Lavalin with the Gaddafi regime.

As Trudeau scrambles to do damage control, it should be remembered that he has embraced Islamic supremacists, as well as policies of open-door immigration, heedless of the costs of all this to taxpayers. Meanwhile, he perpetually downplays the dangers of jihad, to the peril of Canadian citizens.

Even the Liberal-leaning CBC noted that in the week since the SNC-Lavalin story broke, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has changed his talking points several times, and now risks brand damage. Between the Globe and Mail and the CBC, it doesnt look as if the $600,000,000 bailout package that Trudeau pledged to media, widely considered to be a bribe in an election year, is working in his favor.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is backing Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They say President Donald Trump has been advised that Craft’s confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he is considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley.

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the US delegation to the UN General Assembly under President George W. Bush’s administration. She is also friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her “longtime friendship and support” at her swearing-in as ambassador.

As US ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump’s first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

Trump is also considering US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former US Senate candidate John James of Michigan for the post.

Nauert’s weekend withdrawal from consideration came amid a push within the administration to fill the position given a pressing array of foreign policy concerns in which the United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council, is likely to play a significant role. From Afghanistan to Venezuela, the administration has pressing concerns that involve the world body, and officials said there had been impatience with the delays on Nauert’s formal nomination.

Trump said Dec. 7 that he would pick the former Fox News anchor and State Department spokeswoman for the UN job, but her nomination was never formalized.

see also Nikki Haley's sudden exit leaves DC on edge United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley unexpectedly resigned Tuesday— leaving both...

Notwithstanding other concerns that may have arisen during her confirmation, Nauert’s nomination had languished in part due to the 35-day government shutdown that began Dec. 22 and interrupted key parts of the vetting process.

With Nauert out of the running, officials said Pompeo was keen on Craft to fill the position. Although Pompeo would like to see the job filled, the vacancy has created an opportunity for him and others to take on a more active role in UN diplomacy. On Thursday, for example, Pompeo was in New York to meet with UN chief Antonio Guterres.

Three other officials said both Pompeo and Bolton favor demoting the UN position to a sub-cabinet-level position, and Grenell has suggested he isn’t interested in a non-cabinet role. The officials were not authorized to discuss internal personnel deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haley had been a member of the cabinet and had clashed repeatedly with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others during the administration’s first 14 months. Bolton was not a cabinet member when he served as UN ambassador in President George W. Bush’s administration, and neither he nor Pompeo is eager to see a potential challenge to their foreign policy leadership in White House situation room meetings, according to the officials.

Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, describes Craft as warm and gracious and said she is often underestimated.

“She’s always, ‘Oh, you know, I’m not the policy expert.’ But she has a disarming quality. She’s not a policy intellectual, but she’s more emotionally astute and so I think she is more effective than she comes off,” Sands said.

Craft is married to billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they are major Republican donors.

Craft has been ambassador during a low point in relations.

The Globe and Mail reported:The RCMP [charged] SNC-Lavalin and two subsidiaries with corruption and fraud for allegedly paying nearly $48-million to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to influence government decisions under the Moammar Gadhafi regime. The RCMP also charged the Montreal-based company, its construction division and a subsidiary with fraud and corruption for allegedly defrauding Libyan organizations of about $130-million.A Globe and Mail opinion editorial accused Trudeau of abusing political power in pursuit of assisting SNC-Lavalin’s desire to evade federal charges:Breaking an election promise by using an omnibus bill to slip remediation agreements into last year’s budget for the benefit of SNC-Lavalin, and then pressuring the justice minister to play ball, and then demoting her when she didn’t, and then blaming her for not saying anything if she felt pressured, and then standing by while “Liberal insiders” spread rumours about her character – that’s called doing your job in the modern PMO.Wilson-Ray has since retained former Canadian Supreme Court Justice Thomas Cromwell as legal counsel.In his resignation letter, Butts denies any wrongdoing while warning of “climate change” as “one issue above all others.” He wrote:I also need to say this (and I know it’s a non sequitur).

I hope the response to it becomes the collective, non-partisan, urgent effort that science clearly says is required.

310,Empty,2019-02-25T19:05:29Z,"With a big scandal in Ottawa that centres on a large company in Quebec, who cares about that part of the country west of Ontario?","Something important happened Friday. In a much earlier age — like, a month ago — it would probably have made big headlines. But that was before federal Liberals began devouring themselves bit by bit over a scandal they insist is a total figment of the imagination of their former justice minister.

Social media can only handle one outburst of moral fervour at a time, so the important thing that happened got buried away where people wouldn’t notice. Except in western Canada, which doesn’t count. Because with a big scandal in Ottawa that centres on a large company in Quebec, who cares about that part of the country west of Ontario?

The important thing that happened was a ruling from the National Energy Board. It was identified as a “Reconsideration” of its original ruling on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, because a court found the first ruling inadequate and ordered a retry. The retry once again concluded the project should go ahead, while tacking on 16 new recommendations to the 156 conditions already demanded.

Until Jody Wilson-Raybould’s conscience came along, Trans Mountain was right up there with the most pressing matters facing the Trudeau government, which snapped up ownership of the pipeline after so badly bungling the issue that the original builder opted to back out. But Friday’s NEB ruling slipped by with all the fanfare of a statement from the federal fisheries minister celebrating Cod Replenishment Day.

Until Jody Wilson-Raybould’s conscience came along, Trans Mountain was right up there with the most pressing matters facing the Trudeau government

Even in the provinces that would be most affected by the pipeline, reaction was muted. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley did not perform a handstand while barking “Take that, Jason Kenney!” Instead she observed warily, “It’s not a victory, but it’s an incredibly important step.”

Scott Moe, her counterpart in Saskatchewan, observed that the ruling does nothing to alter the uncertainty created by the Liberals’ determination to push through Bill C-69, which Moe and many others believe will make it even harder to win approval for crucial infrastructure projects.

“We need to find regulatory certainty as we move forward, and I fear Bill C-69 will not provide us with that,” he said.

Notley shares his concerns about the regulatory shackles Ottawa is intent on affixing to Canada’s energy industry.

“When we lost the case in August, my biggest concern then was actually the NEB process,” she said. “That to me was the process I was worried could be dragged out much longer than it has been.”

Notley is a New Democrat, Moe a conservative, but they share a lack of faith in the Liberals’ ability to do right by their provinces and the millions of Canadians who live there, or whose livelihood depends to some degree on the energy industry. The furor over Wilson-Raybould has demonstrated that the Trudeau Liberals were willing to move heaven and earth to prevent SNC-Lavalin facing corruption charges that might impact Quebec’s economy and the company’s employees, at the same time they profess helplessness to free the oil and gas business from its torment.

In SNC-Lavalin’s case, Trudeau was willing to go so far as to press Wilson-Raybould to overlook a key section of the law his government put in place that blocked SNC-Lavalin from receiving a get-out-of-jail pass on the basis of its economic importance. And when she wouldn’t bow to him, his chief aide made a point of reminding her of his concerns, as did Canada’s top bureaucrat, backed up by additional pressures on her chief of staff. Even as the crisis rages around it, the government appears intent on finding a way to save the company from itself, with possible changes that could let the company bid on federal contracts even if it’s found guilty on the corruption charges.

Don’t expect that to satisfy the hard-boiled elements determined to hold up the project at any cost

None of that sort of leeway appears on the horizon for the energy business, which provides paycheques to far more Canadians than SNC-Lavalin could ever hope. Friday’s NEB ruling only stirred further the forces of obstructionism that have managed to impose one delay after another.

“We still say no to the project. Even if one Nation says no to the project, the project isn’t (happening). They don’t understand what consultation means,” declared Chief Judy Wilson, a member of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.

“All I can say is this is going to bring more people together. This will never have the Indigenous support along the pipeline,” added Grand Chief Stewart Phillip.

The NEB heard interventions from 52 Indigenous groups and individuals. Lawyers, chiefs and environmental absolutists are already gearing for new court challenges. They insist traffic associated with the pipeline will put untold pressure on killer whales off British Columbia’s coast, a claim dismissed by federal Fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson.

”It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline,” said Wilkinson, a Vancouver Liberal.

“There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year,” he told the CBC. “There are thousands of ferries … All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.”

Don’t expect that to satisfy the hard-boiled elements determined to hold up the project at any cost. The West’s economy isn’t important enough to the Trudeau government to take the sort of extreme steps it has in the SNC-Lavalin affair. It still has hopes of enough support from Quebec in October’s election to justify its willingness to bend, twist and possibly break its own laws, but west of Ontario is a Liberal desert, and even its B.C. support may suffer from the Wilson-Raybould fallout.

Notley also faces an election, which must be held by May, with little evident hope of victory. A loss would cost Trudeau an important one-time ally in his fight for a carbon tax. In her place he’d face the far-more combative Jason Kenney and a revival of the west-vs.-east antagonism that took so long to cool in the wake of an earlier Trudeau.

The federal cabinet now has 90 days to decide on whether to press ahead with the NEB recommendation. As if Justin Trudeau needs another outburst of “progressive” anger on the cusp of his re-election bid. Maybe he’ll get lucky and a new scandal will appear to again divert Canadians’ attention from the mess he’s wrought in the West.

The event — featuring a speech by Justin Trudeau and dinner for 70 guests — was slated to be held at Portobello's, until the group moved its booking two weeks ago, Bennett said.

That was one of the final blows, after a winter filled with cancelled reservations and no-shows at the Duckworth Street restaurant.

""People book reservations for large groups or parties and they don't show up for those reservations,"" Bennett told CBC News.

CBC News emailed Trudeau's team to confirm the reservation was cancelled. No response has yet been given.

Aside from Trudeau and his group of supporters, Bennett said he had three Saturday nights in a row throughout December where groups of 30 or 40 people didn't show up.

On Valentine's Day, 36 tables were booked and 14 cancelled or no-showed.

""That hurts the bottom line,"" he said. ""Small things like that, it makes a difference, and you can ask any local restaurateur in this city and they'll tell you the exact same thing.""

We used to get a lot of oil groups coming to the restaurant. We hardly see them anymore. - Barry Bennett

​Portobello's moved to its location at the east end of Duckworth Street 10 years ago. Before that, it existed for a year at a different location on the other end of Duckworth.

Bennett thinks the location was also a factor in their decline — it's off the beaten path of foot traffic in downtown, sitting 1.4 kilometres from George Street.

He bought into the business a few years ago, and eventually took it over. It became his full-time job. In a short period of time, he's seen the restaurant business take a hit, influenced heavily by the local economy.

""We used to get a lot of oil groups coming to the restaurant. We hardly see them anymore,"" he said.

""More restaurants are opening up this spring and there's restaurants closing up right behind it. There's no give there.""

Support local, owner urges

What irks Bennett is seeing more national franchises, which are run by local managers and staff but have profits heading out of the province, popping up around the city.

While he says people like to talk about supporting local, Bennett wants more people to pay attention to where they are spending their money.

An example, he said, is the Liberal event moving to the Alt Hotel — owned by the Germain group of hotels, based in Quebec.

""Trudeau was supposed to be in our restaurant today for that meeting, for that reception, but they cancelled on us two weeks ago and brought their business to a mainland franchise,"" he said.

""And so the local person has to miss out on that.""

Staff surprised, but understanding, owner says

Portobello's had a staff of 25, many of whom had been there for several years.

Bennett broke the news to the public Friday on Facebook, posting that the restaurant would be closed until further notice. He said the staff didn't have much of a heads up.

""They were obviously upset because they didn't get much time, no notice really, because I had to stop the bleeding.""

Bennett said he wants to thank all the staff and customers from the restaurant's 11 years in business. He'll lay low for a while, mapping out his next steps, but said he hopes to see them again in the future.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday that he has selected Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, as his nominee to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Trump said in a pair of tweets that Craft ""has done an outstanding job representing our Nation"" and he has ""no doubt that, under her leadership, our Country will be represented at the highest level.""

Two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters had told The Associated Press that Trump had been advised that Craft's confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he had been considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had backed Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, the people said. Trump's first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

McConnell praised Craft as ""an exceptional choice for this critical post."" He added, ""She has a long record of service to her state and the nation and I'm confident she will continue to serve with distinction as America's voice to the world at the United Nations.""

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly under President George W. Bush's administration. She is also friends with McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her ""longtime friendship and support"" at her swearing-in as ambassador.

As U.S. ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump had also considered U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former U.S. Senate candidate John James of Michigan for the post.

Nauert's withdrawal from consideration came amid a push within the administration to fill the position, given a pressing array of foreign policy concerns in which the United Nations, particularly the U.N. Security Council, is likely to play a significant role. From Afghanistan to Venezuela, the administration has pressing concerns that involve the world body, and officials said there had been impatience with the delays on Nauert's formal nomination.

Trump said Dec. 7 that he would pick the former Fox News anchor and State Department spokeswoman for the U.N. job, but her nomination was never formalized. Notwithstanding other concerns that may have arisen during her confirmation, Nauert's nomination had languished in part due to the 35-day government shutdown that began Dec. 22 and interrupted key parts of the vetting process. Nauert cited family considerations in withdrawing from the post.

With Nauert out of the running, officials said Pompeo had been keen on Craft to fill the position. Although Pompeo would like to see the job filled, the vacancy has created an opportunity for him and others to take on a more active role in U.N. diplomacy. On Thursday, for example, Pompeo was in New York to meet with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

Trump has demoted the U.N. position to sub-Cabinet rank, in a move backed by both Bolton and Pompeo, according to three other officials. Grenell had suggested he wasn't interested in a non-Cabinet role. The officials were not authorized to discuss internal personnel deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haley had been a member of the Cabinet and had clashed repeatedly with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others during the administration's first 14 months. Bolton was not a Cabinet member when he served as U.N. ambassador in President George W. Bush's administration, and neither he nor Pompeo is eager to see a potential challenge to their foreign policy leadership in White House situation room meetings, according to the officials.

France's U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said she looks forward to working with Craft, if confirmed by the Senate, ""after the particularly close and trusting partnership that I had developed with Ambassador Nikki Haley.""

""I hope that Ms. Craft will continue, like Nikki Haley, to be a bridge between Washington and the UN at a time when we more than ever need an America that is engaged with the U.N. in world affairs and committed to our shared values, beginning with human rights,"" DeLattre said.",Trump picks ambassador to Canada for UN post,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-picks-craft-nominee-un-post-231526643--politics.html
313,Empty,2019-02-22T16:28:49Z,"Justin Trudeau campaigned on the promise of a kinder, more respectful, fairer, more open and transparent government, not one that would engage in a raw, cynical exercise of power.","The twists and turns, allegations and rebuttals that come seemingly by the hour in the SNC-Lavalin affair are catnip to political watchers. But let’s get real: It’s not as though most people are leaping out of bed in the morning having dreamed in their precious sleeping hours of the Shawcross Doctrine.

While it is the job of Ottawa insiders to report and consume every detail and do their best to interpret how it’s affecting the Justin Trudeau government’s political fortunes, for everyone outside the beltway, assessing the prime minister and his officials in this an election year comes down to two things: the Stink Factor and the Stick Factor.

To recap: There have been allegations Trudeau and his then-principal secretary Gerald Butts pressured now-former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to interfere in a decision over whether to prosecute Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin on fraud and bribery charges arising from past dealings in Libya, or whether to instead negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement.

The former would see the company, if convicted, banned from bidding on lucrative Canadian government contracts for 10 years. The latter would see SNC-Lavalin avoid a trial in exchange for admitting responsibility, giving back any profits earned from wrongdoing, and paying a major fine. The situation reportedly led Wilson-Raybould to resign as a cabinet minister. Days later, Butts was gone as well.

Based on what we know, the stink factor is putridly gag-worthy.

Based on what we know, the stink factor is putridly gag-worthy, not necessarily because of the steady stream of details regarding who said what to whom, but because fundamentally, this comes down to the perception of a cabinet minister – a person at the senior-most level of government – being punished for not doing what the Prime Minister’s Office wanted on a criminal matter.

Sure, her successor, David Lametti, and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, are stepping forward now to offer committee testimony nuancing the tone and tenor of the discussions between Wilson-Raybould and officials, and Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau. But that cannot erase the overwhelming view that she was dropped from her portfolio unceremoniously for not following orders.

It’s the type of thing people might have expected from former prime minister Stephen Harper and his PMO, but this wasn’t supposed to be Trudeau’s style. He campaigned on a promise of a kinder, more respectful, fairer, more open and transparent government, not one that would appear to engage in a raw, cynical exercise of power.

Canadians aren’t impressed. Two of three polls in the last week show the Liberal party sinking in voter intention. Trudeau’s personal brand – arguably the most dominant part of the current “Liberal” label – is similarly deteriorating. The Conservatives, seizing upon this gift from the political heavens, have pulled ever-so-slightly ahead in the horserace while leader Andrew Scheer leverages the opportunity to show his stuff grilling Trudeau during Question Period.

But how long will it linger? What’s the Stick Factor? In the last two weeks, this government has gone through several cans of air freshener in attempts to eliminate the general smell emanating from 80 Wellington Street, with little success.

The constant drip-drip-drip of news isn’t helping. Making things worse, the way scandals are covered has evolved.

The constant drip-drip-drip of news isn’t helping. Making things worse, the way scandals are covered has evolved. Governments, their advisers and caucus used to be able to brace for a few days or weeks of bad coverage, then wait for the media cycle to turn. But in the age of social media, the end of the story isn’t determined by an assignment editor. Video clips of Wilson-Raybould standing up in the House of Commons to request the opportunity to “speak her truth,” and those of Trudeau obfuscating in response to direct questions, will be shared and shared, giving the story a viral staying power.

Even if people get bored following a complicated scandal (and they do), there will be cumulative effects. Trudeau can never smell as clean (politically speaking) as he once did. That cleanliness was a major reason Canadians turned to him in 2015. Come October, it may be that the best the Liberals can hope for is an electorate that collectively holds its nose when voting.

Sen. Wanda Thomas Bernard, a longtime social justice advocate, said her office complained to the PPS on behalf of the coalition, which was invited to Ottawa for a series of meetings with federal cabinet ministers on Feb. 4. The visit was to coincide with Black History Month.

The visitors said a government employee and a PPS officer referred to them as ""dark-skinned"" before they were asked to leave the parliamentary cafeteria, even though they had the required passes to be in that area.

""They [PPS] determined that the officer involved ... he's Francophone and had some discomfort around the term 'black' because that term means something different in the French language,"" Bernard said in an interview.

""So, his use of language was identified as the area of concern, and they've taken some steps to address that with him.

""However, they've also made a commitment to work specifically with my office in terms of looking at their overall training around equity and diversity and anti-racism issues.""

The PPS has completed its investigation into the complaint and apologized for the incident.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also apologized to members of the coalition during a private meeting Thursday at the Black Cultural Centre in Cherry Brook, N.S., which Bernard also attended. Trudeau acknowledged that anti-black racism remains a problem across Canada and that more needs to be done to address it.

There are discussions about making the PPS training an annual event, which Bernard said would be a good step toward addressing what she called a ""systemic"" issue.

""This is not the first time there's been incident of racial profiling on Parliament Hill,"" she said.

""Several of us have spoken out about incidents of racial profiling on Parliament Hill. I've had other visitors — family members even — who've come to the Hill and had experiences.""

Bernard said the incident on Feb. 4 started when an MP's staff member took a photo of the group on a phone, sent it to security and asked for the group to be removed from the cafeteria, alleging they were being noisy and disruptive.

""Those young people were told to wait in the cafeteria for the next series of meetings that they were having with MPs,"" Bernard said.

""The fact that an MP's staff would take a photo to lodge a complaint to have these young people removed from that space and to not see anything wrong with that, that's hugely, hugely problematic.""

Bernard said she's pleased the PPS has committed to work with her office to address issues of unconscious bias, systemic discrimination and racial profiling.

Scheer introduced a House of Commons motion Monday afternoon that would demand Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appear at the Commons justice committee to explain his role in allegations former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured not to proceed with a criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Quite simply what we’ve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the Prime Minister’s Office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice,” Scheer said in a news conference before introducing the motion. Scheer said Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick’s testimony to the justice committee last week made it clear that SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the Criminal Code to be changed to allow for remediation agreements. Those allow companies to avoid a criminal prosecution in exchange for accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, paying fines and reparation to any victims, relinquishing any financial benefit from the actions and showing changes to prevent misdeeds from being repeated. Striking such an agreement would mean SNC-Lavalin could avoid a criminal prosecution in Canada for allegations it bribed officials in Libya to win contracts there.

Scheer said the Liberals launched “an unsolicited, co-ordinated and sustained effort by the PM himself to get the former attorney general to change her decision. “Canadians need to be outraged at the suggestion that politicians were putting pressure on independent agents of the Crown, independent legal officers, to try to get a better deal for well connected friends of the Liberal party,” Scheer said. “That is unacceptable and we need to be outraged about this because of the implications it has on the entire justice system across the country.”

The Liberals don’t appear ready to support the Conservative motion to call Trudeau to testify. The motion would not be binding in any event, and a Commons committee can’t summon a sitting MP to appear before it. Arif Virani, the Liberal parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, said in the House of Commons there isn’t a need for the Commons to inject itself into the proceedings of the justice committee. If the committee wants to call certain witnesses the committee members can decide who they want to hear from, he said. “Committees of this house do exemplary work,” said Virani. “We’re confident that the committee hearings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.” Thus far the committee has heard from Wernick, deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin and current Justice Minister David Lametti. Lametti replaced Wilson-Raybould in the job in January, when she was shuffled to veterans affairs. She resigned from cabinet altogether a few days after the allegations of improper pressure were first raised, but continues to sit as a Liberal MP. She is expected to testify at the committee this week but no date or time has been confirmed. Trudeau denies any improper conduct occurred and that any conversations on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin were done with Wilson-Raybould knowing the final decision was hers alone.

Victoria Maruyama was born in Hong Kong and, because her father was Canadian, has been a Canadian citizen since she was a baby. When she was a year old, the family moved to Edmonton, where she grew up.

At the age of 22, she went to Japan to teach English.

""I met my kids' dad,"" Maruyama said in an interview with The Canadian Press. ""The plan was just to teach English throughout Asia, move around from one country to the next, but he kind of scotched my plans.""

She was seven months pregnant with their first daughter, Akari, in 2009 when Conservative government amendments to the citizenship laws took away her right to pass on citizenship to her children unless they were born in Canada.

By that time, it was too late in her pregnancy to fly back to Canada. Her second daughter, Arisa, was also born in Japan.

The girls are now seven and nine years old and, despite moving back to Edmonton almost two years ago, Maruyama is still fighting for them to become Canadian.

""We had to struggle to get my kids in school. We had to fight to get them health care. They had no health care for months. Then they had it for six months and then they were stripped of it again,"" she said.

""It should be my right to come home with my children and for them to be educated and ... have health care and vaccinations and all those basic things.""

Vicki Maruyama prepares her daughters Akari, right, and Arisa, left, to go outside to play in Edmonton. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press)

A January letter from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada notes Akari and Arisa were rejected because ""they are not stateless, will not face special and unusual hardship if you are not granted Canadian citizenship and you have not provided services of exceptional value to Canada.""

Officials with the federal department said in a statement that decision-makers determined that criteria for citizenship have not been met.

""As part of the determination, the best interests of the child were considered,"" they said in an email. ""However, sufficient evidence was not provided to demonstrate that the children have been denied access to basic services in Canada.""

Maruyama's lawyer, Charles Gibson, has filed an application for a judicial review in Federal Court. He argues that the rejection is unlawful and that the Citizenship Act is discriminatory.

""It creates two classes of Canadian citizens,"" he says in court documents. ""One class that can perpetually pass on or inherit Canadian citizenship and one that cannot. The Citizenship Act precludes the applicant's mother from passing ... on her Canadian citizenship to the applicant.

""As a result, the applicant has suffered a great deal of hardship.""

Don Chapman, an advocate for ""lost"" Canadians, said the law also goes against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Canada signed in 1990.

""You have the right to live in the country with your parents. You have the right to an education. You have a right to medical. You have a right to seek legal guidance if the country won't do this,"" he said.

Chapman said there are many expat Canadians who could find themselves in the same situation.

""It's a problem that's going to explode.""

When Justin Trudeau was citizenship and immigration critic, he promised in a March 2011 news release to change the ""anachronistic"" law.

If the kids had been abandoned, the kids would be Canadian. - Don Chapman, advocate for 'lost' Canadians

But Morgan said the Liberal government still hasn't addressed the loophole for second-generation Canadians born abroad.

""It means there's only one group of Canadian citizens that have a litmus test to get their kids in,"" he said. ""If the kids had been abandoned, the kids would be Canadian. If you or me or any other Canadian adopts the children, they have a right of citizenship. If Vicki had been an immigrant Canadian and then naturalized, her kids would be Canadian.""

He said the Maruyama family is caught in the middle of the 2009 legal changes.

""There's Trudeau going a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, and no, no and no,"" said Chapman, who noted the Conservative Opposition has also been silent on the issue. ""They all talk about refugees and immigrants, but no one is talking about this.""

Maruyama said if they aren't able to get citizenship, her girls could apply for permanent residence status as immigrants — a possibility confirmed by the federal Immigration department.

""They would have a higher level of citizenship than me because they [could] ... pass on citizenship to their children,"" she said. ""But me living here 20-some years is not enough.

317,Empty,2019-02-23T00:41:30Z,At the heart of the doctrine is that the attorney general must be fully independent and in control of her own processes,"It is my experience that truth is most often found in the middle, or as the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus said rather more poetically, “in the depths.”

With that lens, imagining just for a minute that truth generally lies between extremes, consider again the SNC-Lavalin/Jody Wilson-Raybould business.

(The caveat is that, speaking of depths, I am somewhat out of mine, in that I have never worked in Ottawa as a political reporter precisely because I find the place greasy and incestuous, and generally regard it with suspicion.)

Thus far, the prevailing narrative goes as follows.

The former attorney general is a heroic and even noble figure who stood her ground as all around her, sinister forces — the slip-slidey folk of the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts, plus Justin Trudeau himself, and others in cabinet, plus the SNC lobbyists — leaned on her to change her mind and negotiate a plea with SNC instead of continuing with the fraud-and-bribery prosecution underway, and then punishing her, when she bravely refused to yield, by booting her out of the AG’s office as soon as possible.

Wilson-Raybould has yet to speak her truth, as that loathsome phrase goes, and depending on how frank she believes she can be at the justice committee next week, it may well be that this is exactly what she will say happened.

But even if that’s so, there are some unanswered questions about this scenario.

The first is, was the pressure from the PMO (and other ministers and officials such as clerk of the privy council Michael Wernick, who earlier this week admitted calling Wilson-Raybould in December of last year to give her some “context” for the potential consequences the SNC prosecution might have) improper?

Did all this breach what’s called the Shawcross doctrine — the name comes from a speech made by the late Sir Hartley Shawcross, a brilliant English lawyer who was then the AG and was talking about attorney-general/prosecutorial independence — and which is also practised in Canada?

At the heart of the doctrine is that the attorney general must be fully independent and in control of her own processes.

Designed to protect AG independence, Shawcross doesn’t mean an AG can’t consult her colleagues, or even that they can’t tell her about real considerations they believe she may have ignored, but that she is not to be put under pressure.

There comes a point when a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer his own conscience

Trudeau, Butts and Wernick — the only significant voices heard, in various ways, thus far — have been adamant that they did nothing improper or inappropriate and that Wilson-Raybould was always aware the decision was hers and hers alone.

Wernick, in fact, said he’s content to leave this issue for the ethics commissioner to determine, and appeared confident his judgment would be confirmed.

And if Wilson-Raybould felt she was being subjected to undue pressure, Wernick said, why didn’t she object? She had numerous avenues and opportunities to do so, and he mentioned an array of these, from a call to the PM or the ethics commissioner to a “pull-aside” at cabinet, but to his knowledge, she didn’t avail herself of any of these opportunities.

(It must be said that neither Wilson-Raybould nor Trudeau appeared to give much of a whit about all that vaunted independence when they were tweeting their “thoughts” about the verdict in the Gerald Stanley case early last year. “As a country we can and must do better,” Wilson-Raybould wrote. “I am committed to working everyday to ensure justice for all Canadians,” thus suggesting in a plausibly deniable way that the verdict was wrong and that justice for the Indigenous man, Colten Boushie, who was killed by Stanley wasn’t so hot.)

Now Wernick didn’t suggest Wilson-Raybould could have resigned, but she could have done, of course — the question of why she didn’t hangs fatly in the air.

It’s not unprecedented, as my more learned legal colleagues have pointed out: B.C. attorney general Brian Smith did just that in 1988, over precisely the same issue — he quit because he could no longer carry out his duties without “the support of the premier and his office, who do not appreciate the unique independence that is the cornerstone of the attorney general’s responsibilities in a free parliamentary democracy.”

Only by resigning and speaking out when he did, Smith said, could he protect the sanctity and tradition of the AG’s office.

Wilson-Raybould stayed in office, accepted her shuffle to veterans affairs in mid-January, and did not resign until Feb. 12, a few days after a Globe and Mail story alleged she had been “pressed” to change her mind on SNC.

Did she imagine that her particularly potent credentials (she is an Aboriginal woman), which are so very important to this prime minister and his government, meant that she would not, could not, be moved? Did she gamble that those credentials would protect her?

She still could have resigned if not in the moment of all that pressure then at this moment — refused the shuffle and stood on a point of principle, quit the cabinet but remained as an MP.

Where is truth in the murky middle here?

It was Sir Shawcross who said, this at the Nuremberg trials where he was the English prosecutor, “There comes a point when a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer his own conscience.”

Quebec lawyers try to save immigrant applications amid crackdown

Reuters ^ | February 22, 2019 | by Allison Lampert

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

MONTREAL - Lawyers in the Canadian province of Quebec on Friday asked a judge to halt the suspension of almost 20,000 applications by immigrants caught up in a crackdown by the new center-right government.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers applications as the bill is being debated.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

Last year federal officials stressed that Ottawa had overall responsibility for immigration law in Canada.

That's despite some members of the group now questioning how fundraising dollars are being spent and academics wondering if the pro-pipeline message was overshadowed by other concerns.

""Bigger than we even expected,"" said Glen Carritt, who organized the convoy which saw nearly 170 semis and trucks leave Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14 bound for the nation's capital where they held rallies over two days on Parliament Hill.

""Because of all the Canadian people we met along the way, right from the day we left … and all the people we saw in Ontario. That's what it was all about, all of those people we saw.""

The group has said its chief complaint was that the federal government's energy and environmental policies are hurting Alberta's beleaguered oil and gas sector, but members also protested the Liberal government more broadly, globalism and migration.

Now about 50 vehicles strong, the group stopped in Dryden, Ont., overnight Saturday on their way back west.

""Some people, we dropped a few off in Ontario and some went their own way,"" he said.

""But we're going to gain a few here and there who want to travel with us for a little while.""

Carritt said the plan is to make it as far as Regina, Sask., on Sunday before completing the trip home to Red Deer, Alta., on Monday evening.

""Everybody's in good spirits,"" said Kevin Peters, one of the road captains for the convoy. ""The rest of the country is waking up and there is nothing the media can do to hide it.""

Racism became a focus: political scientist

The goal of the convoy was to have their message heard by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government, something Carritt feels they accomplished.

""I think it was received,"" he said. ""If they don't see what this message is, then they're even more arrogant than I thought they were.""

Critics are divided, however, on whether or not the convoy was as effective as it could have been, given that some of its participants seemed more interested in protesting Ottawa's immigration policies than arguing for specific fixes for Alberta's oilpatch.

""The problem was some of the participants were engaging in messages that were arguably racist, questions about that racism got raised, and then it became a matter of defending whether they were racists or not,"" Calgary-based political scientist Lori Williams told CBC News earlier this week. ""Now that's not the message they wanted to focus on.""

The convoy, originally called a yellow vest convoy, was renamed after it was linked to hateful rhetoric.

Organizer won't say how much was spent

Social media posts also questioned how more than $141,000 raised through a GoFundMe account for the trip was being spent.

Carritt, who is also a town councillor in Innisfail, Alta., said he has been paying out of his own pocket for hotels and gas for the group.

""Because GoFundMe money doesn't just come in all at once, it trickles in,"" he said.

""I would suggest that rather than taking any of your information from a Facebook page that is jealous of what we have accomplished … you would realize that Glen Carritt is taking care of all these people and Glen Carritt will not walk away from these people and Glen Carritt is the guy that's making sure all of these people get home safe.""

Carritt wouldn't say how much he has spent during the trip.

""A lot,"" he said. ""I've got some good lines of credit and I'm making sure that everybody is taken care of. All of it is being funded right now and then it will all get straightened out by a chartered accountant when we get back.""

Carritt said members of the group with receipts will be reimbursed for the cost of fuel and lodging during the trip.

""I would say by the end of the day, there's going to be over 100 people start to finish [to be reimbursed],"" he said.

""Some people have left but they're still going to have receipts to hand in. When they left, I gave them my email address and said make sure we get it all fixed up when we're done.""

Some of those who left the group early said they did so over safety concerns.

""We're supposed to be united, we're supposed to be as one. It's come to my attention that people are trying to get people against each other,"" said Cathy Monteath in a Facebook video post.

Monteath said she received death threats after posting a video which showed her infant daughter out of a car seat while the family's truck was on the highway.

She also questioned how the funds raised are being used.

""I've put fuel in people's vehicles out of my own money, all on the hopes of handing in a receipt and getting reimbursed,"" she said.","United We Roll convoy '100%' successful, says organizer, despite concerns over funds raised",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-united-we-roll-convoy-organizer-1.5031454

321,Empty,2019-02-25T23:42:04Z,Why did Trudeau apply ‘relentless pressure’ to get Wilson-Raybould to change her mind? The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could,"There is no calm for the Liberals as the storm of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s upcoming appearance at the justice committee rumbles towards them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could.

Trump said in a pair of tweets that Craft ""has done an outstanding job representing our Nation"" and he has ""no doubt that, under her leadership, our Country will be represented at the highest level."" Two people familiar with the matter told the AP that Trump had been advised that Craft's confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he'd been considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had backed Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, the people say. Trump's first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the US delegation to the UN General Assembly under President George W. Bush's administration. She's also friends with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her ""longtime friendship and support"" at her swearing-in as ambassador. As US ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of NAFTA. Craft is married to billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they're major GOP donors. After being named ambassador to Canada, Craft made headlines for telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that she believes in ""both sides"" of climate science.

Craft has been ambassador during a low point in relations: Last year Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weak and dishonest, shocking Canadians. (Read more ambassador stories.)

More than 200 of them are enlisted in the Israel Defence Forces as so-called lone soldiers, serving anywhere from a few months to seve…","Yonah Morrison, 20, was 15 when he first stepped off a plane in Tel Aviv.

Alone in a country he'd never visited, a strange feeling washed over him: He was home.

The Canadian teen spent the next two months in Israel as part of a program that familiarizes North American Jews with the Jewish state. While on that trip, he spent a week embedded with the Israeli military.

He says that week in fatigues left such an impression on him that three years later, in the summer of 2016, after he graduated from his Toronto high school, he decided to leave Canada and enlist in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).

""I always considered Israel to be my home,"" Morrison said. ""I don't see why I shouldn't have to serve, just because I was born somewhere else.""

Military service is mandatory for almost all Jewish Israelis as of age 18, with notable exceptions, one of which — that for ultra-Orthodox men — was at the centre of a bitter political fight that triggered an early election call last December.

But Jews from other nations are also allowed to enlist. They're known as lone soldiers.

Lone soldiers are IDF members with no immediate family in Israel to provide support. Many are new immigrants and volunteers from abroad, but the classification also includes Israeli citizens without family to lean on.

At least 230 Canadians were serving in the Israeli military, according to 2017 statistics from the IDF, with periods of service usually lasting around two years. Hundreds more go over for shorter periods of service through similar programs to the one Morrison did in 2013.

Statistics are based on 2017 numbers provided by the Israel Defence Forces and the Lone Soldier Centre in Israel. (IDF/Facebook)

Renewed violence

The use of Canadian lone soldiers in the IDF has attracted some controversy given the military's role in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Clashes between the IDF and Palestinian militants intensified late last year in a two-day assault of rocket fire and retaliatory air strikes between Hamas and the military. The violence was the most intense since the 2014 Gaza war and left seven Palestinian militants and one Israeli officer dead.

That flare-up came in the wake of international condemnation of Israel for its use of force earlier in 2018 at the Israel-Gaza border against protesters who were objecting to the opening of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem and attempted to scale a border fence.

The United Nations estimates 171 Palestinians were killed and thousands more injured during demonstrations that lasted for most of the year, and another 57 were killed in ""other contexts,"" including ""Palestinian attacks, Israeli airstrikes and infiltration attempts into Israel."" The UN reported one Israeli death in that period.

Eran Lerman, a former member of the IDF's military intelligence division and the Israeli prime minister's National Security Council, said the IDF has protocols to handle protests without causing civilian casualties, but he said more could be done to improve the military's ""social responsibility.""

The World Health Organization and the UN voiced concerns that potentially thousands of Palestinians have been left permanently disabled as a result of injuries sustained during the protests. Doctors Without Borders released a statement characterizing the military response as ""unacceptable and inhuman.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weighed in last May, saying Canada found the ""excessive"" use of force ""inexcusable"" and called for an investigation into the Gaza shootings.

Canada not tracking IDF soldiers

Neither Global Affairs Canada nor the Department of National Defence nor Public Safety Canada currently keeps track of the Canadians serving in the Israeli military.

The issue of keeping tabs on Canadians who choose to fight overseas was the subject of heated debate in the House of Commons last spring, as opposition MPs pushed back against Public Safety Canada's pitch to reintegrate returning members of ISIS.

The debate resurfaced recently around the question of what to do with Canadians being held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as the U.S. withdraws from Syria.

But that debate concerned radicalized Canadians fighting for a terrorist group, not Canadian citizens serving in the military of a long-standing ally.

Experts caution against drawing a comparison between Canadians serving in the IDF and those who leave to join extremist groups.

""Israel, however controversial it might be, is considered to be an ally of the Western world,"" said Derek Penslar, a professor of Jewish history at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.

""There's a very close military relationship.""

When it comes to military operations, Canadians in the IDF must follow the same orders as other service members, said Houchang Hassan-Yari, a Middle East expert with the Royal Military College of Canada.

""When they're there, they have to perform duties assigned to them by their commanders,"" he said.

Hassan-Yari says the Canadian government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens wherever they are in the world and as part of that should start tracking Canadians serving as lone soldiers.

""It's not really acceptable for the government to say they don't keep track of that.""

Other countries also allow foreign nationals

You don't need to become an Israeli citizen to join the IDF. Some programs allow foreigners with Jewish roots to serve in the force for shorter periods of time.

Military rules for dual citizens differ around the world. Canada allows non-citizens to join its military, though one of the requirements is that they hold valid permanent residency and fulfil other criteria.

The U.S. allows non-citizens to serve in its armed forces, with certain restrictions on the ranks and roles they can hold.

Bolivia, Russia and Belgium also allow foreign nationals to serve.

France has a special branch of its army made up of soldiers from other countries known as the Foreign Legion. Recruits don't swear allegiance to France but to the Legion.

It has existed since 1831 and boasts almost 9,000 members from over 100 countries, according to French military statistics. Soldiers in this special unit fought key battles in the First World War and are deployed around the world. Soldiers are eligible for French citizenship after three years of service.

Potential conflict of interest

In Canada, questions around dual citizenship and the government's responsibility for those who hold more than one citizenship have been raised in the past, and even though Israel and Canada are close allies, situations could arise that might place lone soldiers in a difficult spot.

Guidy Mamann, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer, says Canadian lone soldiers could face ""a conflict of interest at some point.""

Military service is compulsory for all Jewish Israelis as of age 18. Here, an Israeli soldier from the Home Front Command Unit takes part in an urban warfare drill in Israel's Negev Desert. (Amir Cohen/Reuters)

For example, he said, they could be asked to use surveillance on Canada or be ordered to do something counter to the country's interests.

If it ever comes to that, Mamann said, there are rigorous treason laws in Canada to handle those situations.

Ultimately, ""every country is responsible for their own citizens"" whether at home or on foreign soil, he said.

'I knew Israel was a land worth protecting'

For his part, Morrison sees his service as protecting his heritage.

""I want Israel to be here for future generations,"" he said.

In December 2017, one of Morrison's friends from Canada joined him in the IDF.

""I feel that I made the choice based on how I felt about the country and what the IDF stands for,"" Noam Zeldin, 19, said in an interview with CBC News conducted over Facebook Messenger.

Zeldin, who is serving on a mortar team, says it's nerve-racking to have to be ready for combat at all times, even when he's asleep or in the shower but that he feels he's doing his part.

""I knew Israel was a land worth protecting and a land I would want to protect.""

Morrison and his friend Noam Zeldin, pictured in 2017 before Zeldin was drafted into the IDF. (Yonah Morrison)

However, military life does take its toll.

Neither Morrison nor Zeldin had lived away from their families before joining the IDF, and neither spoke Hebrew. Both applied for dual citizenship when they made Aliyah — a term used to describe the process of immigrating to Israel from the Jewish diaspora.

""We rely on one another instead of relying on our families,"" Morrison said of the roughly 7,000 lone soldiers in the IDF, about half of whom are Israelis who don't have family or financial support in Israel.

The soldiers do receive some supplemental benefits from the military and support from groups like the Lone Soldier Centre, which provides housing and other services, and other organizations, including some in Canada. (The Lone Soldier Centre, for example, has charitable status in Canada through the Ne'eman Foundation, a fact that has been called out by critics who see any Canadian support for the Israeli military as controversial.)

But that doesn't help prepare them for the danger that comes with serving in the military.

Morrison said during his service, red alerts for rocket fire have been the norm. At his former military base near Be'er Sheva, a community in southern Israel, there was a bomb shelter every few metres, he said, because it only takes about 15 seconds for a rocket from Gaza to reach the base.

Criticism of IDF falls on lone soldiers, too

While the IDF is a source of great pride for most Jewish Israelis, compulsory military service does have its opponents. In 2017, a teenage girl was jailed for refusing her conscription. Five years earlier, an Israeli-Canadian woman who was visiting Israel for a wedding was sentenced to three months in prison for skirting her military service.

In 2016, Vice News reported that some Israelis purposefully fail tests to be declared unfit to serve. Others leave the country to avoid military service. Those who do can be arrested if they return to Israel — even for short visits — although Israeli citizens who are living outside of the country can defer military service under certain conditions.

Lone soldiers' Canadian citizenship doesn't make them immune from the criticism aimed at the Israeli military.

""Those who criticize Israel's choices in dealing with the Palestinians indicate that the whole of the IDF are guilty of this,"" said Costanza Musu, an associate professor in public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa who studies Israeli-Palestinian relations and Canada's policy in the Mideast.

""By extension, any Canadian who is serving in the Israeli army ... is seen as participating in actions that are very controversial.""

For now, Morrison and Zeldin plan to continue serving in the IDF. Morrison is set to be released in July 2019, and Zeldin in 2020.

Neither is sure what the future holds for them — including whether or not they will return to Canada.","'I don't see why I shouldn't have to serve': Why young, Jewish Canadians are enlisting in the Israeli military",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/idf-israel-canada-lone-soldiers-1.4670746

The byelection in York–Simcoe is one of three scheduled for Monday. Ballots will also be cast in the riding of Burnaby South in B.C. — where federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is in a struggle for his political future — as well as in Outremont in Quebec.

The federal Conservatives have held York–Simcoe, just north of Toronto, since 2004 and won it by a considerable margin of 12.5 points over the Liberals in 2015.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson said Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue on Monday.

""We've had a great team of volunteers going door-to-door. And you know, it's been –15 C, –20 C, wind blowing — good old York–Simcoe weather. But that didn't stop us from knocking on over 16,000 doors,"" he said.

Davidson was joined by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer at an afternoon rally attended by dozens of supporters in Sharon, Ont.

Scheer said that the current SNC-Lavalin controversy embroiling the Lilberals will only sway more voters to Davidson's camp.

Shaun Tanaka, who also ran the Liberals in the riding in 2015, said she believes voters are hungry for a change. (CBC)

The candidate running beneath the Liberal banner in York–Simcoe, however, said voters in the riding aren't focused on mudslinging in Ottawa.

""To be honest, that's not what we are hearing at the doors. What we're hearing at the doors are issues about families, and the challenges that families face,"" said Shaun Tanaka, who also ran in the 2015 federal election.

""I think what is going to affect the vote are the issues that matter to people in York–Simcoe,"" she said, adding that residents in the riding haven't had a representative in the House of Commons for nearly six months.

The seat has been vacant since Sept. 30, 2018, when former Conservative MPP Peter Van Loan formally retired from politics.

""I think our riding is ready for a change,"" Tanaka told CBC Toronto.

Undoubtedly, the Tories are looking for a major win in York–Simcoe with a federal election looming in October. CBC polls analyst Éric Grenier wrote last month that the riding has been 20 points more Conservative than the rest of the country as a whole in the last three elections.

""If the Conservatives are in a position to form a government, York–Simcoe is the kind of riding they should expect to win with at least 55 per cent of the vote,"" Grenier said in a piece published on Jan. 10.

Though she admits she's facing a steep uphill battle, NDP candidate Jessa McLean said she hopes to ""change how we look at what is possible from our governments and from each other.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean faces a tough challenge in a riding where the New Democrats have struggled to gain traction. She said her campaign has been about changing the conversation around the important issues in York–Simcoe. (CBC)

325,Empty,2019-02-22T19:56:24Z,He has a very high bar when it comes to self-embarrassment,"Fermat’s Last Theorem was a doozy of a headscratcher that kept the very best noodles of mathematics in a whirl of frustration and despair from 1637 — when Fermat scribbled in the margin of a book that he had a solution for it (but that it was too large to fit on the side of the page) — to 1995. That’s 358 years. It was finally solved by the British mathematician, Andrew Wiles, after decades of recondite theorizing, endless computation, and manic determination (Jacob with a Numbers Angel). He beat Fermat at last.

Or is thought to have done so. I’m certainly in no position to rule on Mr. Wiles’ wily exegetics. For intricacies of this altitude, and for a cool head when under potential fire from the unruly brigands of number theory, this is the point when we dilettantes at the Post throw the switch, light up the Bat Signal, veer it west and beckon Dr. C. Cosh.

I make my own grade-school allusion to Mr. Fermat and his riddle only to suggest that the scale of the problem, its enduring challenge to the very best of minds and its resistance to definitive resolution invokes a disturbing comparison to a current teaser of equally daunting perplexity: the bottomless challenge of solicitor-client privilege.

Can Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak? Or can she not? Evidently she can speak in cabinet — for she did

The entire harem of lawyers in the civil service, the covey of external academic superstars, the top-rate attorneys in practice available for consultation on a phone call from the prime minister, the current attorney-general and his cohort of legal ninjas, the bar societies of all the provinces and territories, and at least one retired Supreme Court justice hired to represent the former attorney general, Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould — all seem unequal to the problem. They languish. It is a real snorter.

Can Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak? Or can she not? Evidently she can speak in cabinet — for she did. In caucus? I’m unsure. In the justice committee? Evidently the authorities have not delivered a ruling on that. The prime minister can speak. And does so variously every day. Sometimes he even speaks for Ms. Wilson-Raybould. The clerk of the Privy Council can speak. Gerald Butts can speak, at least to the point that he may deny he has done anything wrong or untoward.

Can it be that solicitor-client privilege is an unfathomable, impenetrable legalistic black hole from which no light can emerge that it is currently and conveniently for all sorts of reasons made out to be? Apparently it must be so for certainly up to now it has held within its irremediable grasp all the key information that could settle the crisis and upon which a government’s fate depends.

One other feature of the week was the prime minister’s determinedly robotic turn in Wednesday’s question period. He has a very high bar when it comes to self-embarrassment.

He showed none whatsoever in absolutely ignoring the specific questions being put to him, and issuing a nearly identical and fully irrelevant answer to every single different inquiry during question period. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer asked about 15 particular questions and to each one the prime minister gave, with minuscule variation, a gauzy non sequitur about his concern for jobs and the middle class and something about the rule of law. He could just as easily have risen and said “it’s raining in Tanzania now” or “cats have four legs and a tail” for all the connection his answers had to the questions before him. The Liberals sometimes applauded the travesty, thought we must believe — they are human — there were inwardly ashamed of his pure witless evasions.

One other feature of the week was the prime minister’s determinedly robotic turn in Wednesday’s question period

Meantime if “jobs for the middle class” were the prime minister’s heart’s desire, he might have stepped out of the Commons and said at least a hello to the gathering of truckers who had driven all the way, in coldest February, from Alberta to Parliament Hill. They were there to describe how things are for working people in Alberta (and other provinces) since the oil industry has been battered by world prices, the fire in Fort McMurray, the killing of pipeline projects, the stalling on the remaining Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, and the flight of capital (another multi-billion-dollar oil company announced this week that it was packing up for the U.S.).

Most of them were salt-of-the-earth types, not the professional agitators, perpetual demonstrators and seasoned road-blockers that constitute Canada’s protesting class. There are two groups: those who make a living out of protest (see above); and those who protest (and only as a last resort) because they can’t make a living. The former in fact, are very much the reason the latter had to come to Ottawa.

It wouldn’t have hurt Justin Trudeau to extricate himself from the pointless metaphysics of solicitor-client privilege and wander out to shake a few hands and have a couple of chats with real people in real language about what they’re feeling, what they’re going through and what they might be seeking from his government. If a prime minister can make it to We Day revivals, or Women in the World #MeToo congratulatories to exchange progressive bon-mots with such eminences as Katie Couric, Tina Brown and Mira Sorvino, surely a few minutes with a handful of Western Canadian truck drivers, heavy-equipment operators and laid-off electricians shouldn’t be too much of a burden.

They travelled over 2,000 miles by truck; he had, at most, a few hundred yards on foot. And their only concern was jobs, the very jobs he was so repetitiously insisting were his prime concern during the woeful performance in question period.

In one sense, and a very real sense, a couple of well-meant hellos to these folks, a bit of listening to pick up their sense of things, might very well have had more value and more substance than all the artful, posturing theatrics of the past two weeks on SNC-Lavalin and Jody Wilson-Raybould’s still enigmatic dilemma. As between the two venues — the protest outside, the farce within — I know where reality lies.

A footnote: the plastering of the convoy with the tag that it was “fringed” or “infiltrated” by white supremacists and all sorts of other odd, despicable types was a cheap one exercised by many in the media. The main purpose of this group, and the people who organized and executed the trip, was clear as day, and as important as any issue in the country at present. If you’re going to characterize protests by whatever fringe elements may or may not attach to them, please do it universally. Next time there’s Occupy sit-in at Queens Park, or an anti-pipeline march in Vancouver, note the flags, check the repeat attenders, and find out who’s backing them.

Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Tomorrow night, party leader Jagmeet Singh finds out if he's secured his first-ever seat in the House of Commons — staving off what almost certainly would be a mortal threat to his leadership.

And while he's waiting to hear the results in the riding of Burnaby South, he'll also be watching anxiously as the returns come in from Outremont, one of three ridings holding byelections Monday night. The riding of York-Simcoe, in the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area, is expected to remain in Conservative hands, but the other two seats are seen as up for grabs.

For Singh, the stakes in Burnaby South are substantially personal: a win there may be the only way to silence the internal grumbling about his leadership that threatens to follow him into a general election campaign.

For the NDP itself, Outremont is symbolic: losing the Montreal-area riding held by former leader Tom Mulcair until his resignation on Aug. 3, 2018, would send a dire signal to voters and prospective candidates alike about the party's ability to hold at least some of the Quebec base that made it the Official Opposition in 2011.

Singh isn't believed to be a lock to win Burnaby South. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But New Democrats, publicly and privately, are expressing confidence about Singh's chances in the riding. ​Singh has put in the work; he and his team estimate they have knocked on over 30,000 doors in the riding since launching his campaign back in August.

""Biting my nails? No,"" said Quebec NDP MP Pierre-Luc Dusseault. ""I mean, from what we heard on the ground now — in Burnaby, especially — things are good. So I am not too stressed about this one.""

""Once you spend a lot of time or get to meet Jagmeet, you'll like him and he'll be a great addition here in the House,"" said B.C. New Democrat MP Wayne Stetski.

""We will certainly be winning in Burnaby. We have a tight race in Outremont, but we have a great candidate,"" said Ontario NDP MP Charlie Angus.

The stakes for Singh

Losing Burnaby South would put Singh in a bad place. His profile in federal politics has been held back by his absence from the Commons. The CBC's Poll Tracker puts the party's national support at just 14 per cent, while its recent fundraising performance has been dismal.

With an October federal election bearing down, nervous New Democrats have put Singh on notice. Last month, CBC News reported that several senior members of the federal caucus warned Singh back in June that he won't be able to hang on as party leader if he loses in Burnaby South.

""He absolutely must do well, win that seat. Because if he doesn't, if he happens to lose, I don't see how he can stay on as leader,"" said Karl Belanger, former national party director and principal secretary to Mulcair.

Some New Democrats see a win in Burnaby South as the only way to silence the self-destructive party chatter about Singh's limits as a politician — grumbling that former NDP strategist Farouk Karim compared to ""shooting yourself in the foot.""

""I mean, you're not helping yourself,"" he said. ""Once people see you as a winner, things change. Everything is a domino effect. People have a better perspective on who you are.""

New Democrats are less confident of their chances in Outremont. Earlier this month, CBC News reported that three separate polls showed the party struggling in Quebec, scene of its spectacular ""Orange Wave"" breakthrough in 2011. The party won 16 seats in Quebec in the 2015 federal election and the Quebec contingent makes up the largest provincial grouping in the federal NDP caucus.

Those three polls all put the party underwater in Quebec — below the 12.2 per cent of the vote the party captured in Quebec in the 2008 federal election, when Mulcair was the province's sole NDP MP.

That's bad news for the party's Outremont candidate, Julia Sanchez — and worse news for the party itself, which is struggling already with the fact that more than a quarter of its caucus members have decided they won't be running in October.

On Thursday, two Quebec New Democrat MPs — Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach — announced they will not seek re-election later this year.

""Losing Outremont will be emotionally difficult, not only for Tom Mulcair, but for a lot of New Democrats across the country,"" Belanger said.

A glass half full

Some New Democrats are describing the party's byelection prospects as a glass half full — suggesting that a win in Burnaby South coupled with a loss in Outremont would represent nothing more than a symbolic changing of the guard.

""A new generational leader comes up at the Burnaby byelection, while we lose the riding of the former leader. So it's energizing,"" said Karim. ""I think people will like it and people can't wait to see Jagmeet in action in the house and to energize the base towards the election.""

But that spin underestimates Outremont's symbolic value to New Democrats — and the demoralizing effect a loss there would have on a party that still needs a foothold in Quebec.

""If you combine a loss in Outremont with the recent results in other byelections that happened in Quebec recently, with the current polling, the prospects of NDP MPs returning to Parliament from Quebec en masse are very slim,"" said Belanger.

""It is very symbolic because it was the first seat won by an NDP MP in Quebec in a general election and obviously became the beachhead that led to what became the Orange Wave in 2011.""

The hunt for candidates

A loss in Outremont could make it much harder for the NDP to attract top-quality candidates, said CBC News poll analyst Eric Grenier.

""They already have a number of incumbents who said they're not running again. They need some good candidates, they need some fresh faces,"" he said.

""But if they're not able to show that they're actually able to win, to get support in the province, are they going to have good candidates? Are they going to be able to make the case that they are the ones who can represent Quebecers in the House of Commons?""

Grenier said that if the NDP loses Mulcair's Quebec seat, it should fervently hope to at least come in a close second.

""Quebec is so important to the NDP that they need to have a sign that they still have a chance to be competitive in the province.""

329,Empty,2019-02-22T19:01:38Z,Jagmeet Singh needs to win a seat in parliament before he can run for prime minister,"The leader of Canada’s left-of-centre New Democratic Party faces a key byelection on Monday that will decide whether or not he is able to challenge Justin Trudeau in October.

Jagmeet Singh, the first non-white leader of a major political party in the country’s history, must win the byelection in Burnaby, a city east of Vancouver, in order to get a seat in parliament and be in position to go up against the Canadian prime minister in this year’s general election.

While parties often decline to challenge a leader seeking a seat, both the Liberals, Conservatives and the newly-formed People’s party are running candidates in Burnaby South.

Mr Singh, the former human rights lawyer-turned-politician surprised his party – and the country – when he wrapped up the leadership race with a decisive first ballot win more than a year and a half ago. His quick rise in federal politics has excited voters across the country.

“His leadership can be seen as refreshing. People saw him as this very telegenic, easy-to-like guy, who might be able to compete on the celebrity level with Trudeau,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration.

But since his leadership win in late 2017, he and his progressive party have fallen into disarray. Sitting parliamentarians have resigned; others have indicated they won’t seek re-election. To make matters worse, the plurality of the seats currently held by the NDP are in Quebec, a province where support for the party has plummeted.

Dreams dashed

With party veterans fleeing, haemorrhaging finances and weak poll numbers, the rookie leader has the daunting task of salvaging and reconstituting the party, ensuring a battle-ready machine for the country’s election later this year.

Some of Mr Singh’s challenges can be attributed to his absence in the House of Commons: despite leading the party, he remains seatless.

“Because he doesn’t have a seat, he hasn’t really been given a lot of opportunity to indicate what his message is. He’s not in the house with the rest of the [leaders]” said Turnbull. While touring across the country seems like a good idea, she said,Mr Singh can’t be seen trading barbs with other party leaders.

Some feel that Mr Singh’s status as the first non-white leader of a major political party has also prompted unfair criticism of his tenure. While newly minted political leaders in Canada get “put through the wringer”, the treatment of Mr Singh has been disgraceful, said Rick Smith, executive director at the progressive Broadbent Institute and a former NDP staffer.

Racist nonsense

At the same time, the problems gripping the party are not Mr Singh’s alone.

The broader weakness of the party also raises questions about the future ambitions of the party in Canada’s left-of-centre politics. Long seen as the “conscience” of the country’s political system, the party increasingly has to compete against the Liberals to its right – and the Green Party to its left.

Monday’s test will be politically existential for Mr Singh: as he canvasses neighbourhoods, party members have said Mr Singh’s continued leadership is unlikely if he fails to win. – Guardian",Canada’s first non-white party leader seeks path to challenge Trudeau,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/canada-s-first-non-white-party-leader-seeks-path-to-challenge-trudeau-1.3803123
330,Empty,2019-02-24T20:39:22Z,"As policy wonks look to turn the issue in their side's favour in the federal election, here are a few things they could consider","With housing affordability dominating discussions in living rooms and coffeeshops across the country, policy wonks in Canada’s political parties are looking for some way to turn the issue in their side’s favour in the federal election scheduled for the fall.

“I’m not sure there will be direct measures” on housing in next month’s budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters in Victoria, B.C. a few weeks ago. That could mean the government is saving popular policies for an election campaign later this year, that it will stand pat on the house market, or that it is considering some kind of indirect measures.

Whatever the plan, here are a few policy ideas the government could consider.

Allow longer amortization periods

Since 2012, a 25-year amortization has been the maximum for anyone looking for a CMHC-insured mortgage. As housing affordability worsens, some have called for the government to reintroduce the option for 30-year terms.

A longer amortization period will increase the amount of interest the buyer pays, but it also allows people to spread the mortgage cost over more years. For example, a hypothetical $300,000 mortgage on a 30-year amortization period with an interest rate of four per cent would result in a monthly mortgage payment about $150 cheaper than a mortgage on a 25-year term. However, the buyer will end up paying about $40,000 more in total interest payments over the life of the loan. Some potential buyers struggling to get into the market might jump at that deal.

Adjust the stress test

The stress test, known as B20, requires borrowers to show they can handle interest rates two percentage points above the current rate and has resulted in about 20 per cent fewer mortgage originations among younger Canadians.

Some home builders and mortgage professionals have called for the stress test to be reduced by a half a percentage point or a whole point, which would boost the spending power of most buyers. Others have called for scrapping the test entirely.

The stress test doesn’t just affect new buyers, but anyone renewing their mortgage. If a homeowner is renewing their mortgage and fails the stress test, they lose the ability to shop around and have to renew with their current lender, potentially costing them a discount.

Bigger first-time home buyer credits

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — campaigning for a byelection in the housing crisis ground zero of Burnaby South — has urged the government to double the first-time home buyer’s credit, taking it from $750 to $1,500.

Singh also proposed some relief to renters by proposing a subsidy for anyone paying more than a third of their income on rent payments.

Build affordable housing

Conservative MP Tom Kmiec, the party’s deputy finance critic, repeatedly refers to the distinction between housing affordability and affordable housing. Housing affordability refers more generally to the state of the market and whether a family making an average income can reasonably expect to purchase a house. Kmiec says the government’s policies to cool off the housing market have actually hurt the average Canadian’s chance of affording a house.

Affordable housing refers to government-subsidized housing for low-income people which can help housing affordability more generally, as the supply increases and prices come down.

Singh’s NDP have promised to build 500,000 affordable housing units over a 10-year period, if elected. The Liberal government’s $40-billion housing strategy is based around a “right to housing,” and the plan hopes to get 500,000 Canadians out of housing that is either unaffordable or inadequate. Oppositions parties say the plan has been moving too slowly to have a tangible effect on broader housing affordability issues.

Do nothing

It may not be sexy and, in fact, it may not even be possible for vote-hungry politicians to pledge to do nothing, but some experts say it’s the right path.

Policies that affect the housing market, like the stress test, take time to work, and even longer to show results, and it might be safer to wait for more data before making any policy changes, said Kyle Dahms, an economist at the National Bank of Canada, in a recent interview with the National Post.

The election hasn’t yet been called, but both parties have already staked out key areas of support throughout the province, leaving Calgary up for grabs, according to a study by ThinkHQ Public Affairs.

“The premier does very well in Edmonton, the capital region, and doesn’t do quite as well outside the two major cities,” said president Marc Henry.

“They’re quite evenly matched in Calgary. Calgary’s going to be the battleground for the election. (Jason) Kenney’s going to take most of the seats outside of the two major centres. (Rachel) Notley’s going to take most of the seats in Edmonton and it’s going to come down to who wins Calgary is going to be who the next government is.”

The study also showed that despite efforts by the NDP to draw a stark contrast in leadership between Kenney and Notley, the underlying premise that the premier’s popularity outweighs that of the Opposition leader doesn’t hold up.

When it comes to approval, Notley sits at 44 per cent, compared to Kenney at 43 per cent. But she also suffers from higher disapproval ratings than Kenney, at 51 and 45 per cent, respectively.

“If (the NDP) were going to run on their record, they would have a much more difficult time than running on the leader,” said Henry, pointing to “controversial” policies of the NDP government, including the introduction of a carbon tax and raising the minimum wage.

“I think that there’s some overestimation of how popular Premier Notley is. Her approval numbers are good, but they’re about the same as Jason Kenney,” he said. “The two of them are actually quite evenly matched going into the election.”

Henry said that despite her higher disapproval rating, Notley polls better among undecided voters.

The study surveyed a non-random sample of more than 1,100 people, including about 400 in Calgary, through an online research panel between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6.

It was weighted to reflect gender, age and region of Alberta, according to population figures from Statistics Canada. A probability sample of this size would have a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points at a 95 per cent confidence interval.

In Calgary, the NDP’s vote share is polling near what they achieved during the 2015 election, yet the governing party still trails the UCP by about 15 to 20 points, according to Henry.

He said Notley’s approval ratings are more impressive, in general, than the NDP’s polling numbers.

“So there are more people who think that they like Premier Notley than are planning on voting for them. That’s reversed for Jason Kenney. There are more people planning on voting UCP than there are people who approve of Jason Kenney,” Henry said.

“She’s probably the best tool that they have during the election and they would be wise to focus attention on her. I just don’t think that it’s panacea. It’s not going to necessarily solve the problem that they have.”

Jill Bennett has more... View full cove…","BC Ferries was pulled into the fight over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project on Friday, as the National Energy Board (NEB) issued a decision saying that the project should move ahead.

In its decision, the NEB recommended that the ferry fleet take major steps to slow down and minimize underwater noise in order to protect marine life off the B.C. coast, including the southern resident killer whale population.

The recommendation was one of 16 included in the new decision, which also recommended similar changes for marine shipping vessels and whale watching boats.

BC Ferries said it is already working on reducing underwater noise, but the NEB called for those plans to be accelerated.

“Every vessel we build is quieter than the last, so we want to make sure we’re doing what we can to reduce underwater noise from our ferries,” BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said.

Slowing down vessels and making them quieter aren’t necessarily connected, she added.

WATCH: Coverage of BC Ferries vessels on Globalnews.ca

“Some of our vessels like a “Spirit”-class vessel, for example, have what we call controllable pitch propellers, and when you slow down a vessel with [those propellers], they actually create more noise,” Marshall said.

Last summer, the company released a report saying it has reduced underwater noise on its vessels through improvements in hull design and by using different types of propellers.

“This is going to be a long process,” the report said. “We build our ships to operate for decades, more than 50 years in some cases. New, quieter ships will therefore arrive gradually in the Salish Sea.”

Replacements for BC Ferries’ older C-Class vessels will be built between 2022 and 2030, the report said.

WATCH BELOW: NEB reconsideration report says killer whales will likely be impacted

BC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver said the recommendation could lead the province to invest in new technology for the ferry fleet to address noise and speed.

“One of the things I would like to see us exploring is ferries that have different forms of combustion or actually electric ferries as we more forward,” he said.

Marshall said two vessels that are currently being built will be powered by electric-hybrid technology.

She was also noted that only a few ferry routes actually cross through the shipping routes to which the NEB’s recommendations are aimed, but added that BC Ferries is still taking the recommendation seriously and that it will work with the board and the province to find solutions.

Critics of the decision — and its recommendations — noted that the NEB’s calls to slow down ferries and other vessels is meant to offset the projected seven-fold increase in tanker traffic that the pipeline expansion is expected to generate off the B.C. coast if it’s realized.

The tankers will all carry diluted bitumen from the coast to offshore markets, which environmental lawyers argue would pose more risk to the orca population than underwater noise and vessel speed.

“They know and they’ve already said and everyone has admitted that this project amounts to a death sentence to the southern resident orcas,” Eugene Kung of West Coast Environmental Law said. “But what the board has said is that this is justified under the circumstances because of what they are arguing is the economic benefits.”

Increasing ferry service

The recommendation came as the province also announced Friday it would increase sailings on 10 ferry routes serving coastal communities, including Bowen Island, Texada Island, Gabriola Island, Quadra Island, Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert.

The routes are the same ones that the previous Liberal government cut in 2014. The NDP said the restored sailings would bring back 2,700 round-trip sailings.

“For years, people living in coastal communities saw ferry fares increase and services cut,” Minister of Transportation Claire Trevena said in a statement.

READ MORE: Washington state is converting its ferries to hybrid-electric. Will BC Ferries follow suit?

“Quality, affordable ferry services are a necessity, not a luxury,” she continued. “That’s why we’ve turned the ship around – first by rolling back ferry fares on small coastal routes and now by reversing cuts to services that were making it difficult for people to get around.”

Those routes are expected to start returning as early as the spring, with more services set to be restored over the next year, the province said.

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

Story continues below advertisement

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

Dewar, who represented the riding of Ottawa-Centre for almost a decade, died earlier this month from brain cancer. He was 56.

The gathering at Dominion-Chalmers United Church featured music Dewar loved — like Bob Marley — as well as prayers and tributes from friends and family.

Among those in attendance were his former federal NDP colleagues Murray Rankin, Hélène Laverdière and former party leader Tom Mulcair, as well as his successor as Ottawa-Centre MP, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, and several city councillors. Ontario provincial opposition leader Andrea Horwath also attended.

The ceremony opened with a piano medley of Dewar's favourite songs, and a special blessing from Claudette Commanda, an Indigenous elder and good friend of the family.

""To you, Paul, may your beauty guide us, in healing, in reconciliation and in community,"" she said, acknowledging the gathering was on the unceded territory of the Algonquin people. Commanda said she was honoured Dewar lived on the lands of her people, because he understood and respected their traditions.

A memorial service was held Saturday for former Ottawa Centre member of parliament Paul Dewar, who died on Feb. 6. (Radio-Canada)

His wife's 'bubble of joy'

Dewar's wife and two sons spoke of the effect he'd had in their lives.

""I feel your spirit around me even though you are gone,"" Julia Sneyd said as she read aloud her letter to Dewar, adding her husband lived 80 years, but just compressed it into 56.

""As we shed tears of sadness for a life too short, tears of joy for a life fully lived and tears of hope for a better world ... You will always be my bubble of joy.""

Sons Jordan and Nathaniel recounted road trips, dance parties and musical evenings they'd shared with their father — saying it was his everyday actions that taught them the most meaningful lessons.

The family ended their tribute by telling the crowd ""Smile and play, laugh and dance, give and share.""

Dewar's siblings remembered a young boy in love with the world around him. He was a high energy and active child, his brother and sisters said.

""[He was] always alive and in touch with every person, problem or policy he came in contact with,"" his older sister Cathy Dewar said.

""To the end, Paul loved life.""

Politics in his DNA

Reverend Brian Cornelius, who led the service, recalled Dewar crying the last time they spoke, not tears for himself, but for youth in need in the community because of his deep concern for disadvantaged teens.

""Politics were part of his DNA,"" Cornelius said, recounting a time he saw Dewar approach a young man and ask ""so what should we do about the Senate?""

When his diagnosis was given, Dewar's outlook didn't change, Cornelius said.

""He faced the reality of death, and chose to walk back into life.""

Gavin Charles, part of the team Dewar worked with on Parliament Hill during his time as an MP, spoke of a team builder who wanted the best for his nation.

Watch: Paul Dewar explains his interest in youth

Former Ottawa Centre MP Paul Dewar, who has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, has started a new project to support young leaders called Youth Action Now. Its first major event is Thursday night at the Adult High School. 0:45

""He was honest and frank and loving and kind,"" Charles said. Dewar's encouragement to his team was always ""To do good work, but mostly to do good.""

Dewar was a champion for human rights during his time on the Hill, pushing for more humanitarian aid and help for refugees.

Dewar's farewell message

Before his death on Feb. 6, Dewar wrote a letter that his family posted on Facebook. He said his illness made him truly appreciate the beauty in the world.

""I told you that I thought my illness was a gift and I genuinely meant that. In this time in between, I got to see the wonder of the world around us.""

Politics was a family affair for the former teacher. His mother was former MP and Ottawa mayor Marion Dewar. Paul Dewar won the Ottawa Centre riding for the NDP in the January 2006 federal election, taking over from former NDP leader Ed Broadbent. He was defeated in 2015 by McKenna.

After going public with his diagnosis about a year ago, Dewar created Youth Action Now, an initiative to raise money to help engage young people to get involved in their communities. That movement will be among his lasting legacies.

NDP, Liberal and Green party house l…","VICTORIA — MLAs from all parties overseeing the legislature agreed to hire a retired judge to probe more allegations of wrongdoing at the capital, on the same day that a new report claiming misuse of taxpayers’ money was released by Speaker Darryl Plecas.

The review by the retired judge is in addition to a workplace review and a forensic audit by the B.C. auditor general, and in addition to a separate police investigation. NDP House Leader Mike Farnworth said the co-operation between his party, the Liberals and the Greens was necessary for the good of the legislature.

“I think all three parties around that table take this issue very seriously,” he said. “I know everyone likes to think we’re always at each other’s throats, but the reality is we have to come together on this issue … The public demands that.”

The legislature spending scandal began in November when clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz were suspended and escorted out of the building by police. After investigating both men for almost a year, Plecas released a bombshell report in January into alleged misspending by both men.

James and Lenz responded Feb. 8 denying they had done anything wrong, arguing Plecas himself approved many of the expenses and that they followed proper policies.

Plecas rebuts James and Lenz

On Thursday, a new report by Plecas chips away at the explanations provided by James and Lenz.

For example, Plecas highlighted an August 2017 Legislative Assemblies Business Continuity Network “conference” in Washington state, which James and Lenz attended with 10 other people, including their wives, and dignitaries from Scotland. James, in his earlier response to the Speaker, maintained this trip was legitimate and useful.

But Plecas alleges Washington state isn’t a member of their network, and there was no conference to attend there. Plecas alleges an “earthquake preparedness” event on James’s itinerary was actually a whale-watching expedition. The itinerary also notes the group was learning about large-scale evacuations at Safeco Field in Seattle, but Plecas claims the reality is they attended a baseball game there — expensing $1,073.32 for 13 tickets.

Plecas wrote that he thinks James and Lenz didn’t properly watch taxpayer funds.

“The most charitable interpretation of all of this is that Mr. James and Mr. Lenz really did, and do, consider that all these activities — the innumerable ‘business-continuity’ meetings and trips; the myriad of purchases; the electronics; the benefits and bonuses, and so on — were all proper and necessary business expenses,” he wrote.

“I disagree, and I expect the vast majority of ordinary British Columbians do too. If Mr. James and Mr. Lenz do think that, I believe it shows a lack of judgment, and a repeated pattern of decision-making that is utterly unacceptable in senior executives of a public institution.”

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

Plecas said Thursday he will recuse himself from future investigations, and was happy a retired judge will be hired to take over.

“I’m extremely happy of the decision to have a jurist do an independent review,” he said. “This was incredibly complex.”

Eye-raising expense allegations

Plecas’s original report included many eye-raising allegations, including a $13,000 wood-splitter and trailer that James had stored at his home, lavish overseas trips, a $1,000 piece of luggage, $5,000 in magazine subscriptions, questionable retirement benefits and large-scale payouts of cash in lieu of vacation time.

As a result, MLAs voted to authorize a forensic audit into legislature spending, as well as an independent workplace review.

Two special prosecutors are overseeing an RCMP probe into James and Lenz. Neither man has been charged with any crime. Plecas has said additional allegations were given to police outside of his report, but has refused to make them public.

Thursday’s meeting in Victoria, where MLAs voted to release Plecas’s new report, was crashed by Mark Andrews, the lawyer for suspended clerk James, who said he was also speaking for suspended sergeant-at-arms Lenz. He urged MLAs not to release the new report until it’s provided to the two suspended officials for comment.

“They should be given the opportunity to respond to any further allegations or comments by the Speaker or (his chief of staff Alan) Mullen before those reports are published,” Andrews said.

However, the report was released, and in it he alleged that James and Lenz took multiple trips to visit the same people, all the while claiming they were comparing best practices with new officials. It says taxpayers paid $4,059 to put up two Scottish officials in an expensive Victoria hotel, and they were each given a $232 jade bear for coming here to provide their expertise, even though James and Lenz had spoken to these men on earlier trips.

“What this behaviour invites is a conclusion that many of these trips are no more than useful justifications for reciprocal international visits, substantially underwritten by the public,” Plecas claims in his report.

‘No reasonable explanation’

Plecas has also alleged that James filled his truck — twice — with wine, beer and spirits, and delivered them to former speaker Bill Barisoff in Penticton. In his response, James said that Barisoff paid for the liquor.

Plecas said he found a copy of a June 2013 cheque for $370 from Barisoff, but questioned whether that would pay for the large shipments of alcohol.

“Moreover, Mr. James has provided no reasonable explanation as to why it would have been appropriate for the most senior officer of the legislature to drive up to Penticton to sell wine and deliver a desk and chair to the former speaker, stay overnight at the Penticton Lakeside Inn and drive back the next day, billing all of the expenses to the taxpayers along with his very high salary for two days of work,” Plecas writes.

Plecas also took particular aim at James for having a $10,000 trailer and $3,000 wood-splitter delivered to his property but paid for by the legislature as emergency equipment. James said in his response it was properly approved and he was asked to store it at his home due to a lack of space at the legislature.

But in his second report, Plecas included photos of a concrete pad constructed at James’s home, which he said has many large trees in the 10,500-square-foot backyard. He said the wood-splitter showed signs of being used at James’s home.

“That a committee on which Mr. Lenz and Mr. James sat approved the recommended expenditure as part of purported disaster planning is not, in my view, an answer,” wrote Plecas. “Committees generally place their trust in senior management that expenditures are appropriate and necessary, until that trust is brought into question or broken.”

The second Plecas report also took shots at James and Lenz for other expenses, such as $500 Bose headphones that James said were for an ear condition on flights but Plecas said are still not a business expense.

Cash for vacations unnecessary

Plecas also said he felt neither Lenz nor James worked very hard and could have taken their holidays rather than cashed out payments.

“There was no legitimate reason they couldn’t take their holidays in accordance with the applicable policies rather than bank them and cause the legislature to pay them out,” wrote Plecas.

The new report also includes several pages in which Plecas highlights statements attributed to him in the Lenz and James reports, flatly denies the comments and subsequently in numerous occasions accuses both men of lying.

“My motivation here is, and always has been, rooting out what I see as endemic misconduct by these two officers, and in doing so, shedding light on and hopefully improving systemic practices and protections in this important public institution,” Plecas says in the report.

MLAs on the legislature committee didn’t vote Thursday to change the status of James or Lenz, both of whom remain on paid suspension.

However, Plecas told reporters he thinks both men shouldn’t be allowed back to their jobs.

“These are very highly paid senior officers and the legislature and the public are entitled to absolutely scrupulous conduct from them that does not undermine the trust placed in them, and the dignity and reputation of the legislative assembly,” he wrote in his report.

Farnworth said MLAs want the process with the judge completed quickly. “We are certainly not looking at a year or two years, we want this to be done as expeditiously and as quickly as possible,” said Farnworth.

MLAs voted in February to increase protections for whistleblowers in the legislature, allow the merit commission to audit hiring and place the administrative functions of the legislative assembly under the province’s Freedom of Information law.

336,Empty,2019-02-22T02:00:45Z,"2019 budget demonstrated no long-term vision or economic plan for our province, says Liberal leader","Premier John Horgan wants you to think that everything is OK but it’s not. The 2019 NDP budget is built on a foundation of wishful thinking that ignores the realities of B.C.’s economy and the world around us.

Horgan came to power two years ago on promises of $10-a-day daycare, a $400 renters’ subsidy and a general pledge to make life more affordable. Since then, he has introduced 19 new or increased taxes, gone back on his daycare and rental subsidy promises and done nothing to effectively respond to growing housing unaffordability. British Columbians had high hopes for real solutions and concrete action in 2019.

Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed on Tuesday as Horgan revealed a do-nothing provincial budget featuring a significant increase in government expenditures, still no renters’ rebate, a watered down child care benefit that won’t kick in until the end of 2020 and a speculation tax that treats 1.6 million B.C. homeowners as speculators until proven innocent. In the next year, taxes are going up nearly $1,100 per person. This will also be the year of the now-infamous “double dip” as the NDP continues to charge MSP while simultaneously charging its higher replacement, the Employer Health Tax.

It’s not all bad news though. The proposed rate increase for foster parents and home-share providers is long overdue. We also welcome eliminating student loan interest and providing new funding for youth mental-health supports to expand B.C. Liberal initiatives like the Foundry. Unfortunately, those small measures will do little to solve the systemic affordability problems left unaddressed in this budget.

The people of British Columbia are starting to feel duped. This government’s actions have raised the cost of living and jeopardized the economic growth on which the NDP has pinned all hopes of paying for their spending spree going forward. You’ll have less money to spend and it will be harder than ever for those struggling with the affordability crisis to secure their futures.

Finance Minister Carole James is barely balancing her budget despite the fact that, since taking power, she has increased taxes by billions on individuals, homeowners and businesses. She and Horgan blindly spent the healthy surplus left behind by the former B.C. Liberal government and got lucky with a lucrative transfer payment from the federal government. If not for that federal transfer, B.C. would be facing an $800-million deficit today.

Perhaps worst of all, this budget demonstrated no long-term vision or economic plan for our province. The B.C. Chamber of Commerce stated that business confidence has plummeted, with the number of businesses that believe this government supports them dropping by half over the past two years.

With no actions laid out in this budget to stimulate investment or private-sector growth, that measure of confidence along with economic growth may fall even further. The NDP admits B.C.’s economy will be slowing down, with housing starts and other measures decreasing but takes no responsibility for causing the downturn.

With 2019 as the year of the double dip, along with a slew of other new and increased taxes hitting our wallets, people across this province are going to start to feel the impact of this government placing the financial burden for their fiscal irresponsibility on the backs of hard-working British Columbians, businesses and municipalities. Over the next three years, the NDP will have increased taxes by $1,568 per person since coming to power. There are storm clouds on the horizon, but the NDP blindly insists everything is OK. It’s not.

We deserve a government that grows the economy and focuses on real opportunity for all of us. We deserve better.

Duff Conacher, co-founder of the non-partisan organization that advocates for democratic reform and government accountability, expressed concern after the Star first revealed the Tories urged lobbyists to sell tickets to Wednesday’s fundraiser.

“The PC Party asking lobbyists to sell high-priced tickets to the premier’s fundraising event shows that the Ford government is willing to sell access to the premier for cash, and to trade favours with lobbyists, in violation of the interests of the people of Ontario,” he said. Conacher, an adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, said the governing party will “feel compelled to return the favour by protecting the interests of the lobbyists’ clients. “That means the public interest will be violated.”

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford. No one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said during a trade mission to Washington. “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should make the Tories $2 million.

“We have to run campaigns.” As disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories appealed to lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government. The ban on corporate and union donations has made selling tickets a challenge. Until the changes three years ago, which were triggered by a Star probe of Liberal political fundraising excesses, companies could purchase entire tables for dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. But now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to continue to do business with the Tories, said there has been “tremendous pressure” on his company to sell tickets. “You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” the consultant said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said Friday that “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner said that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.” Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, has said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.” In November, the Tories repealed a section in the campaign finance reform bill that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees. That new loophole means a company or union could, theoretically, make a political contribution in someone else’s name. The government has emphasized it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

After weeks of embarrassing leaks — including revelations in the Star about a new health “super agency” and the opposition NDP’s unauthorized release of a draft government bill — Elliott will table legislation on Tuesday.

“There’s no real surprise in the sense that I’ve said from the beginning that we need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” the minister told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park. “We have some significant problems that we’re dealing with when we have over 30,000 people who are waiting for long-term care beds,” said Elliott. “We have 1,200 people every day in hospitals across Ontario who are receiving health care in hallways and storage rooms; and the wait-list for mental health and addictions is way too long,” she said.

Confirming what the Star first reported on Jan. 17, Elliott said as part of the restructuring there would be a new “super agency” overseeing how health services are delivered. “What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That’s what the centre of all of this is about — to make sure that patients’ needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.”

The minister emphasized that the head of the new super agency would not be a patronage appointment. “We are thinking about the people that we are going to be appointing to the agency. We are wanting to make sure that we are connecting with people that are knowledgeable about our health-care system so that’s what we are concentrating on,” she said. “We are finalizing our appointments ... it is going to be a professional person.” In recent months, the Tories have been criticized for appointing friends of Premier Doug Ford, including Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, 72, the proposed new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose party’s obtaining of draft legislation led to a mid-level government bureaucrat being fired on Feb. 4, said she’s worried about what the revamped system will look like. “They better close this idea of a super agency that’s going to take away the local specifics around what people need in their communities,” said Horwath. “We’re very, very concerned about that,” she said, warning of increased “privatization” in health care. The draft bill, which Elliott downplayed as a “very early” version, would give the new super agency unprecedented powers to contract out health services. One of the leaked documents, titled “agency review weekly status report,” indicates the government has used focus groups to gauge acceptance of the health-overhaul plan. Some 20 existing health agencies are expected to be folded into the new body. Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Justin Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, and principal secretary, Gerald Butts — who quit last week, denying any improper PMO conduct — spoke to Jody Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince, a PMO official said late Friday.

The prime minister dodged several direct questions about why he, his former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Wernick continued to speak to Jody Wilson-Raybould about a possible remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin for months after the director of public prosecutions had rejected it.

Prince answers to Telford within the ranks of political staff. The Prime Minister’s Office would not detail the nature of their exchange. But privy council clerk Michael Wernick told a committee during his testimony Thursday that the conversation among staffers for each office — whom he did not name — may be raised by Wilson-Raybould as a concern if and when she ever goes public.

“I can’t get into any actual details of the conversation itself,” said Trudeau spokesperson Cameron Ahmad. “Any conversations that were had, whether it was this one or any of the other ones that have been referenced, all fall under the category of what the prime minister has described and, frankly, what the clerk described as appropriate conversations where everything was discussed in a proper way.”

Article Continued Below

Until now it had not been clear that Telford had any contact with the SNC-Lavalin file. The PMO has previously said Telford never spoke to Wilson-Raybould directly on the matter. Wernick defended the actions of Trudeau, his senior aides and himself on the file, but conceded Wilson-Raybould may have seen things differently. “How she interprets or perceives those conversations, she can tell you next week. “I can tell you my view very firmly is that they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal. I’m prepared to submit to the judgment of the ethics commissioner on that,” Wernick testified. The Conservative official Opposition said there may be grounds for the RCMP to investigate whether pressure put on the former attorney general in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution amounted to obstruction of justice. Conservative MP Michael Cooper, a member of the Commons justice committee, told reporters it was clear based on Wernick’s testimony Thursday that Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Quebec company long after the director of public prosecutions rejected it. “I think there’s certainly a strong basis to be made for an RCMP investigation,” Cooper said.

The Conservatives went further in question period Friday, charging that efforts by Trudeau and his senior aides to make Wilson-Raybould “change her mind” crossed the line. “With everything we now know, how is this not obstruction of justice by the prime minister?” said Conservative MP John Brassard. Government house Leader Bardish Chagger highlighted Wernick’s testimony that Trudeau had always made clear the final decision on any deferred prosecution the SNC-Lavalin rested with Wilson-Raybould. On Friday, Trudeau was asked if he viewed any of Wernick’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould as applying undue pressure on her, but he declined to pass judgment. He pointed to “mechanisms to look into exactly those kinds of issues. We have an ethics commissioner who’s pursing an investigation, we have a parliamentary committee.” Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith broke ranks with his party mid-week and voted to support the opposition’s unsuccessful call for a judicial inquiry because he said he doesn’t believe the ethics commissioner has a mandate to get to the heart of the matter. Ethics commissioner Mario Dion said he would look at a possible breach of section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act, which prohibits a public office holder from seeking to influence a decision of another person so as to improperly further another person’s private interests. Erskine-Smith said when it comes to the merits of a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin, “whether or not an intervention (by the PMO) may have been justified in substance, the real question is the nature of that intervention. Specifically, was undue pressure exerted, contrary to the constitutional convention of attorney general independence? “In the end, citizens deserve the truth,” he said. “The truth, like confidence in our public institutions, depends on a serious commitment to openness and transparency.” Trudeau has not yet committed to lifting the limitations of solicitor-client secrecy on Wilson-Raybould, saying he awaits legal advice from her successor, David Lametti. On Friday, Trudeau urged Canadians to “heed” the testimony of Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who serves as the prime minister’s deputy minister and secretary to cabinet. Wernick said the former attorney general may have felt pressure to “get it right” on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution but that nobody applied inappropriate or undue pressure. He rejected suggestions the director of public prosecutions had already dismissed the option of a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, and even suggested it continued to be an option. “The decision had not already been made,” Wernick told reporters, defending his conversation with Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19. “She had and continued to have authorities under the law, and it is entirely legal and lawful and appropriate under the Shawcross doctrine to inform a minister of the context in which she’s taking a decision.” Speaking in St. John’s Friday morning, Trudeau dodged several direct questions about why he, Gerald Butts and Wernick continued to speak to Wilson-Raybould, the then justice minister, about a possible remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin even after the director of public prosecutions had already rejected it. Trudeau repeatedly answered by declaring the “fundamental responsibilities of any government” is to protect and promote jobs while upholding institutions, respecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Trudeau called Wernick “an extraordinary public servant who has served this country under governments of different political stripes with integrity and brilliance.” Trudeau added Wernick “is someone who we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly.” Wilson-Raybould — who has stated she hopes to be able to “speak my truth” — is expected to appear before the justice committee next week. Lametti said Friday, “We are working to try to find a way such that the former attorney general can, in fact, speak. We are doing our level best to do that.” Wernick, who is not a lawyer, all but scoffed at Wilson-Raybould’s claim to be bound by solicitor-client privilege. The blunt-talking privy council clerk said the matter was “never” discussed at cabinet, and that no solicitor-client privilege attaches to the discussions because Wilson-Raybould was never “advising” the government on the matter. He said the only thing that ever took place were “lawful” discussions about the impact of potential criminal liability on the company.

340,Empty,2019-02-22T23:55:23Z,"Recently, economists at banks and research firms have joined geographers in comparing the ratio of condo units to number of people or households in Vancouver and Toronto.","The NDP budget forecast a drop in housing starts by as much as 30 per cent across B.C. over the next three years, sparking debate about whether there are too many, or too few, condos being built in Vancouver’s expensive market.

Economists at major banks recently joined geographers in comparing Vancouver and Toronto when it comes to the ratio of condo units to number of households.

While population growth in Vancouver has been lagging that in Toronto, there are more newly completed but unoccupied condo units in Vancouver, according to Stephen Brown, a senior Canada economist at London-based Capital Economics. He found that at the end of last year, there were some 2,000 such units, compared to 1,500 at the beginning of 2018.

“By contrast, in Toronto, the number of (newly completed and unoccupied) units is just 500, despite the population being 2.5 times larger. … The supply situation will probably get much worse. There are currently 42,000 units under construction in Vancouver, compared to 71,000 in Toronto. Vancouver is therefore building 1.2 units for every person that arrived in Vancouver in the past year, compared to just 0.5 units in Toronto.”

In Toronto, Benjamin Tal, an economist at CIBC Capital Markets, agreed that population growth in Vancouver has lagged while “supply, mainly in the high-rise segment, has risen sharply. The number of completed and unabsorbed units in Vancouver is on the rise. In the third quarter (of 2018), the ratio of units under construction to household formation in Vancouver was elevated … while Toronto was still in line with long-term averages.”

At Vancouver-based Urban Analytics, managing principal Michael Ferreira, who tracks data about new multi-family projects, pegged the number of “completed and unsold units” in Vancouver at just 223 at the end of 2018, “which is nowhere close to being an oversupply situation.” Across Metro Vancouver, said Ferreira, “there are fewer than 1,000 unsold condominium units either under construction or completed and move-in ready.”

Other critics argue that estimates of oversupply don’t necessarily take into account the demolition of older units, which reduces the total supply.

As well, census numbers used in some studies do not count the number of temporary foreign workers and students moving into cities, said Anne McMullin, CEO and president of the Urban Development Institute (UDI), which represents developers. She also noted that investors rent out units that form an important secondary rental market.

“We also have to look at building for population growth for the next 10 years, not just now,” said SFU professor of real estate finance Andrey Pavlov.

LISTEN: Professor Andrey Pavlov and lawyer Wes Mussio join Housing Matters podcast host Stuart McNish to discuss the B.C. real estate speculation tax and vacancy tax.

Pavlov said the number of homes stuck in the permit approval process in the Lower Mainland was estimated to be 108,000 in 2017. He has been unable to get updated information from municipalities, but said clearing this backlog would greatly increase supply and potentially bring down prices.

The provincial Ministry of Finance said housing starts are at near-record highs, and noted the previous Liberal government projected 27,521 housing starts across the province in 2018, but the actual number was 48 per cent higher, totalling 40,857. The historical average is closer to 30,000 units, which is what the NDP budget is forecasting by 2021.

Andy Yan, director of SFU’s City Program, looked at all housing starts in Metro Vancouver, including co-ops, condos, rentals and homes, going back more than a decade, and found that after a plunge in 2009 (following the credit crisis), the number of housing starts steadily rose from around 15,000 to 20,000 between 2010 to 2015. The number spiked to almost 28,000 in 2016 and then started to fall to 26,200 in 2017 and again to 23,400 in 2018.

It is the opposite of what had been happening ahead of the peak, when several factors came together, said Yan. Now, “we are in an era of declining assessments. Interest rates are going up. Credit is harder to obtain, as is global capital.”

The Opposition party is also calling for an investigation by the province’s ethics commissioner into the governing New Democratic Party and AHS.

Standing behind a lectern and in front of signs that stated “Rachel Notley. Fighting For You,” the premier spoke at Lethbridge’s Chinook Regional Hospital on Saturday, flanked by nurses as well as Environment Minister Shannon Phillips.

The UCP called it a “partisan campaign event” that violated AHS rules surrounding the use of its public facilities.

“AHS facilities shall not be used for any political activity, including, but not limited to use for the purposes of canvassing, campaigning, making political announcements, touring and other activities,” AHS rules state.

“During an election campaign, political parties are not permitted to use AHS facilities as a backdrop or host location for any campaign event or activity.”

While the Alberta election looms this spring, an election has not yet been called.

Notley’s spokeswoman, Cheryl Oates, said in a statement that “not a single tax dollar went to this announcement.”

“The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of Jason Kenney’s plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because this issue is important to them,” Oates said.

“We were not aware of the 2012 AHS memo outlining their policy on events like this. We understand the concern and will ensure future partisan events are not done at AHS facilities.”

Oates further noted on Twitter that “the event was done in a public area of the hospital.”

UCP House Leader Jason Nixon called use of the hospital “an unethical abuse of public resources.”

“Saturday’s NDP campaign event was not just a clear violation of AHS policy, but it also seems probable that the premier and her staff broke Government of Alberta rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital,” Nixon said.

“I have written to Alberta’s ethics commissioner to ask for an immediate investigation into this event and I’m calling on Alberta Health Services and the premier’s office to explain this clear violation of AHS policy for the benefit of the Notley NDP.”

During the event, Notley spoke out against Kenney’s comments earlier in the week about allowing some private companies to carry out publicly funded health-care procedures, according to the CBC.

“Mr. Kenney wants to cut & privatize our health care system,” Notley said following the news conference in a tweet, which included photos from her appearance at the hospital.

“In Lethbridge, that would mean not hiring 203 nurses. Nurses who wouldn’t be there when you need them.”

Great to visit Chinook Regional Hospital today.

In a statement, AHS said its political activity policy, which came into effect in March 2012, “is designed to maintain AHS’ non-partisan role in healthcare delivery, and to protect our staff and patients.

“The policy outlines that during an election campaign, AHS sites should not be used as a backdrop or host location for any form of campaign event or activity,” AHS stated. “The event at Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge was not organized by AHS and participants were not representing AHS.”

An AHS spokesperson did not provide comment when asked if any employees could potentially face repercussions for participating in the news conference.

Kenney took to Twitter to criticize Notley for holding the event at a public hospital.

“It is an unethical abuse of public resources for the NDP Leader to hold a partisan news conference in a public hospital, as she did today,” he wrote Saturday.

“Those are party, not government signs. This is explicitly prohibited by AHS policy. Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election.”

According to AHS’ policy statement, the public health body “recognizes the personal right of AHS representatives to participate in political activities.”

“AHS representatives may publicly support or oppose any political activity, political party, candidate, or cause in a personal capacity provided they do not use AHS work time or resources . . . or do so while representing AHS,” the organization states.

The Code of Conduct for employees of the Premier’s Office and cabinet ministers states that staff “may not ask employees of the Alberta public service to engage in any activity that is inconsistent with the Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Public Service of Alberta or the Public Service Act.”

LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- A spokeswoman for Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared to acknowledge the poor optics of a weekend appearance Notley made at a hospital, which the Opposition says broke rules prohibiting political activity at health facilities.

Cheryl Oates posted on Twitter on Sunday that while Saturday's event was in a public area of the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge, the premier's office will ensure future campaign events are not done at Alberta Health Services facilities.

A picture Notley posted on Twitter of the event showed her standing at a podium with the message ""Rachel Notley, fighting for you"" on it, with health-care workers standing behind her.

United Conservative House Leader Jason Nixon said in a news release that Notley's NDP government and AHS should be investigated by the province's ethics commissioner for what he called a ""partisan campaign event.""

AHS policy states that elected officials may access their facilities for the purpose of carrying out their duties, provided they don't engage in political activity.

The health agency tweeted Sunday that the Notley event was not organized by AHS, and that participants were not representing the agency.

""The AHS Political Activity Policy, which came into effect in March 2012, is designed to maintain AHS's non-partisan role in health-care delivery, and to protect our staff and patients,"" the health agency said in a separate tweet Sunday.

An Alberta election must happen before the end of May, and Notley could call a vote at any time.

""The NDP's use of a public hospital to launch a partisan attack is an unethical abuse of public resources. Alberta's hospitals belong to Albertans, not to the NDP,"" Nixon said in his statement..

Nixon also suggested Notley and her staff broke government rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital.

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney called the event ""an unethical abuse of public resources.

""Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election,"" Kenney challenged Notley on Twitter.

Oates said on Twitter that ""not a single tax dollar"" went to the announcement.

""The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of (Kenney's) plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because they are worried about what he will do to front-line services,"" she stated.

A Calgary justice says the B.C. government should have waited until the law was in force to file the constitutional challenge, saying the claim was both ""premature and inappropriate for consideration by the court.""

B.C. filed the statement of claim in Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench in May 2018, challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act.

The act, also known as Bill 12, gained royal assent on May 18, 2018, but has not yet come into force on proclamation.

It requires exporters to obtain licenses, and gives Alberta's energy minister the power to decide how much fuel is exported, how it's transported — by pipeline, rail or tanker truck — and whether direct shipments to be stopped altogether.

""The Government of Alberta introduced and supported the Act because it asserts British Columbia is responsible for ""delays"" to an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline … Alberta seeks to utilize powers under the Act to punish British Columbia, and to exert pressure upon British Columbia,"" B.C.'s statement of claim reads.

B.C. said a significant percentage of the fuel it consumes comes from Alberta. It adds any disruption could cause irreparable harm, both to the economy and to health and safety in remote communities that depend on a reliable fuel supply.

B.C. could resubmit once bill is proclaimed

But Calgary Justice R.J. Hall, in a decision dated Friday, said the claim of B.C.'s attorney general was made too early as the bill hasn't actually been proclaimed yet.

""Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the [Attorney General of B.C.] may recommence a claim,"" Hall wrote.

Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said the government is pleased the challenge was struck down.

""This law remains available if necessary. In the meantime, we're encouraged by Friday's NEB decision and are taking decisive action to move more oil by rail until new pipelines are built … we call on the Government of BC to recognize our shared interest in moving our natural resources to new markets as we support their efforts to export LNG,"" she said.

The bill is just one of the province's weapons in its political battle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which Alberta's NDP-led government has accused B.C.'s NDP-led government of blocking.

""Albertans, British Columbians and all Canadians should understand that if the path forward for the pipeline through B.C. is not settled soon, I am ready and prepared to turn off the taps,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said when the bill passed last May.

On Friday, the National Energy Board reiterated its approval of the $7.4-billion pipeline with new recommendations to protect the environment in B.C.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman took to Twitter to reiterate B.C.'s concerns with the project.

This project is not in the best interests of the tens of thousands of people who depend on our coast for their livelihoods.<br><br>We're going to continue to assert our right to defend BC's env't in court & will continue to insist the federal gov't take BC's concerns seriously. —@GeorgeHeyman

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said she's ""cautiously optimistic"" there will be shovels in the ground this fall on the project.

Ontario Liberal Party: $20,081 from just 38 donors.

The Green Party of Ontario has raised $10,310 from 32 donors.

On Wednesday, the PCs will hold what they are calling the biggest fundraiser in the party's history: a $1,250-a-plate dinner at the Toronto Congress Centre.

""Doug Ford and our Ontario PC Caucus accomplished a great deal in 2018,"" says the invitation on the party's website.

""There is much more to achieve in 2019, and to continue getting things done for the people, we need your help to build up our Party's financial resources as quickly as possible.""

To be the biggest fundraiser in the party's history, the dinner would have to raise more than the record $2 million that Patrick Brown brought in during his Toronto leader's dinner in 2016.

Ford's party is trying to build on its fundraising momentum from the election year of 2018, during which the PCs amassed far more in donations than all the other parties combined.

The PCs raised $9.2 million in 2018, according to data compiled by CBC News from the Elections Ontario website, tallying donations at all levels: to the provincial party, to riding associations and to individual candidates.

Total donations to the NDP in 2018 amounted to $4.2 million, according to the Elections Ontario database. The Liberals reported $3.5 million in donations and the Green Party $1.05 million.

The PC party's 2018 fundraising total included $5.5 million logged as election-period donations and $3.7 million reported as annual contributions.

That's separate from another $2.4 million raised in 2018 by the four candidates in the PC party leadership race: Ford, Christine Elliott, Caroline Mulroney and Tanya Granic Allen.

The PCs have been the top fundraisers in each of the past three years, amassing a record $12.9 million in 2016 and collecting more than the Liberals and NDP combined in 2017

All parties are raising far less now than they did before 2017, when the Wynne government banned corporate and union donations.

To make up the shortfall, each party now gets an annual per-vote allowance funded from the provincial treasury, but Ford has promised to end that practice.

The NDP has warned that language in the draft bill allows for greater privatization in the health system.

But Elliott has said the legislation will not include two-tier care, private hospitals, making patients pay for more services out of pocket, or privatizing services such as long-term care inspections and the air ambulance service.

The regulator published the report Friday after the NEB was ordered to reassess the $7.4-billion pipeline expansion from Alberta to the B.C. coast, including the impact of increased oil tanker traffic on the region's endangered killer whale population.

A news conference for reaction to the decision was facilitated by advocacy group Stand.earth and included members of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, including Grand Chief Stewart Phillip; activist Tzeporah Berman; environmental lawyer Eugene Kung; NDP MP Peter Julian; and federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.

'The gauntlet has been thrown down'

They said they were outraged by the decision and further motivated to fight the pipeline from ever being built.

""A complete dog's breakfast,"" said Phillip in describing the process that produced the NEB's latest report.

He called the report a flawed process and vowed that there would be further lawsuits involving the project.

""The gauntlet has been thrown down,"" he said.

Prime Minister push

Berman said the decision supporting expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline ""is the direct result of the Prime Minister's Office telling the board and federal bureaucrats to ""get to yes.""

She said in a news release that scientific evidence filed with the board shows there is not enough data to ensure the safety of salmon runs or endangered orcas.

Berman says the board also failed to address the climate impacts of the Trans Mountain expansion, which will increase the number of oil tankers in the port of Vancouver from about five per month to at least 34.

Despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's argument that the pipeline is in the best interests of Canada, Berman vows Trans Mountain ""is not in the public interest and will never be built.""

The NEB said the project would cause ""significant adverse environmental effects"" on the southern resident killer whale population, and while a worst-case spill from the pipeline or an oil tanker is not likely, ""the environmental effects would be significant.""

It said though that the project and its risks are justified in light of the benefits of the pipeline.

The ""Don't Steal #OURsubway Day of Action"" was organized by the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 — which represents some 11,500 TTC workers — along with the union-connected transit advocacy group TTCriders and the Toronto Labour Council.

Participants handed out flyers to subway riders in an effort to raise awareness about the impending upload, while ATU Local 113 members wore T-shirts over their uniforms that read ""Don't Steal Our Subway"" while on the job.

""Ripping the TTC Subway from the rest of our public transit system will create havoc for riders, add unnecessary bureaucracy to our system and take local control away from city transit planning,"" said Carlos Santos, president of the union.

Shelagh Pizey-Allen, spokesperson for TTCriders, said the group hopes to encourage transit users to ""call the premier, call their MPP and tell them: 'Don't steal our subway, fund it instead.""

Last year, the Progressive Conservative provincial government announced that it intends to take over ownership of Toronto's subway network. The province would control construction of subway infrastructure and maintenance, while the city would keep revenue generated by the subway system.

Transportation Minister Jeff Yurek has argued the upload would allow for a more efficient expansion of the existing network. Earlier this month, the province and city have reached ""terms of reference"" for negotiations for the upload.

The plan is bitterly opposed by some transit riders, city councillors and the provincial NDP. They argue that the city needs to maintain its control over subways to ensure that it has a say in future development of transit and other infrastructure around subway stations.

Protesters carried an effigy of Ontario Premier Doug Ford outside Queen's Park station. (CBC)

The problem is not that the city owns the subways, critics argue, but that the TTC has been chronically underfunded since the mid-1990s, when former premier Mike Harris's government cut provincial subsidies for the service.

Yurek responded to Friday's protest on social media, calling it ""NDP fearmongering.""

""A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster,"" he wrote on Twitter.

For its part, TTCriders says the upload will result in higher fares, poorer service and generally more ""chaos"" during peak hours.

""There's going to be a loss of accountability if the transit system doesn't stay integrated and in Toronto's hands. Why would an MPP in Parry Sound or Kenora care about investing in our system the way that we need?"" said Pizey-Allen.

Push for public awareness campaign

Toronto councillors Josh Matlow and Joe Cressy intend to introduce a motion next week that would see the city launch a public information campaign ""regarding the importance of retaining control of Toronto's subways.""

The campaign would include ads on TTC vehicles and in stations, as well as a series of public consultations to help residents better understand the consequences of transferring control of the city's subways to the province.

""Torontonians should also know that with Toronto's subway, the province would gain control of lucrative air rights above stations and adjacent properties, owned and paid for by Torontonians,"" reads the motion, titled ""Save Our Subway: Ensuring Torontonians Know the Facts.""

Matlow has also posted an online petition calling for the TTC's subways to remain under the city's ownership.

349,Empty,2019-02-22T02:03:18Z,First Nations have been lobbying for a share of provincial gambling revenues for 20 years as a way of providing socioeconomic benefits to their communities.,"VICTORIA — The New Democrats this week announced “the largest agreement with First Nations in B.C. history,” a plan to divert hundreds of millions of dollars in gambling proceeds to Indigenous communities.

The first $200-million instalment in the $3-billion, 25-year plan will be paid this spring to a First Nations partnership that will redistribute the money to member communities.

All 203 of B.C.’s recognized First Nations are eligible for a share, though to collect they need to sign up with the First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Limited Partnership, scheduled to be up and running this April.

The partnership, wholly owned and controlled by First Nations, will distribute the money under guidelines laid down by the three major First Nations organizations in the province through their gaming commission.

Eligible uses for the funds are six-fold: Health and wellness. Infrastructure, safety, transportation and housing. Economic and business development. Education, language, culture and training. Community development and environmental protection. Capacity-building, fiscal management and governance.

The rules also preclude direct distribution of any of the money to individuals.

Recipient First Nations are required to report annually to the partnership with an audited financial statement on how the money was spent in their communities.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

First Nations have been lobbying for a share of provincial gambling revenues for 20 years as a way of providing socioeconomic benefits to their communities.

The breakthrough contribution is calculated at seven per cent of gambling revenue, currently running at about $1.4 billion a year. The first instalment is front-end loaded to cover two years’ worth of funding. The funding formula laid down by the First Nations Gaming Commission provides for a three-way split on the global amount, currently estimated at $100 million a year.

Half, in the range of $50 million, will be reserved for each First Nation, or about $250,000 apiece.

A further 40 per cent, about $40 million, is to be distributed on the basis of population. There being about 150,000 Indigenous people in B.C., it works out to $265 or so per capita.

The remaining $10 million will be evenly split among several dozen communities that are recognized as especially needy because they’re geographically remote. The annual payout is expected to fall between $250,000 and $2 million, depending on how the various factors in the formula work out.

For those First Nations that fail to join the partnership straightaway for whatever reason, their designated share will be banked for three years before being distributed to the active partners.

The same will apply where funding is being withheld from a given First Nation because of failure to comply with accountability requirements.

The New Democrats have assured First Nations this will be all new money.

There will be no reduction in pre-existing funding agreements such as last year’s $550-million commitment to build 1,750 units of housing for Indigenous people on and off-reserve.

Nor does the seven-per-cent commitment to First Nations mean any change in the long-standing allocation of 31 per cent of gambling revenues to a special health account, or the dollars ticketed for community grants and local governments.

Any money left over will continue to go into general revenues, to pay for other programs.

The commitment to the revenue-sharing partnership flowed from the summit meeting last fall between Premier John Horgan and his cabinet and First Nations leaders.

That was also where the New Democrats promised to make B.C. the first province in Canada with legislation harmonizing its laws and policies with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

According to the terms of the agreement, the B.C. bill is supposed to be “not dissimilar” to an equivalent piece of federal legislation, currently before the Senate.

The federal measure originated three years ago as a private member’s bill from Romeo Saganash, an NDP MP from Quebec.

But after gaining endorsement from the federal Liberal government, which initially dragged its feet on UNDRIP legislation, the Saganash bill passed through the House of Commons last spring.

Bill C-262 obliges the national government, in consultation with Indigenous peoples, to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with UNDRIP.”

It further dictates that “the government of Canada must, in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples, develop and implement a national plan to achieve the objectives of UNDRIP.”

Those ambitions notwithstanding, the federal bill provides what looks to be a leisurely time frame for implementation.

The federal minister for Indigenous and northern affairs is given 20 years to update parliament annually on fulfilment of the aforementioned two objectives.

It is unclear whether the “not dissimilar” provincial legislation will provide that much leeway in B.C.

The NDP government bill, currently in the drafting stage, is supposed to be “in place,” meaning enacted into law, no later than the fall session of the provincial legislature.

UNDRIP consists of 46 separate articles, the most controversial of which guarantees “free, prior and informed consent” to First Nations over land use and resource development within their traditional territories.

350,Empty,2019-02-22T17:28:00Z,"Much-awaited ruling is expected to bring strong reaction from Alberta and B.C. governments, still embroiled in a bitter legal battle — and the business community, oil sector workers, First Nations and environmental advocates.","The National Energy Board ruled Friday that the project can move ahead despite “significant” environmental effects because the project’s benefits are in the public interest.

CALGARY AND VANCOUVER—Advocates and opponents of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion stood their ground Friday as a renewed review of the contentious project recommended approving it.

The NEB also added 16 recommendations for the federal government, including measures to manage cumulative effects on the Salish Sea, offset underwater noise, prevent ships from striking marine mammals and fish, respond to oil spills, consult with an Indigenous advisory committee, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The recommendations aren’t legally binding, and Steedman said they are considered “important advice to government.”

If the project is to go ahead, it must comply with 156 conditions, the board said. The regulator found marine shipping traffic from the pipeline project would harm killer whales and Indigenous cultural uses related to the whales, as well as release “significant” greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking in Calgary, the board’s chief environmental officer Robert Steedman said the expansion should be approved.

However, the board also said the risk “can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits,” as long as there are measures to minimize harm.

The NEB report is one of the factors the federal government will consider when deciding whether to move forward with the project.

The decision was being closely watched by industry, First Nations, oil sector workers and environmentalists — and it serves as a reminder of the bitter ongoing legal spat between Alberta and British Columbia. While Alberta Premier Rachel Notley welcomed the ruling as an “important step” toward resuming pipeline construction, B.C. Premier John Horgan said in a statement that he is still “convinced Trans Mountain is not in the best interests of British Columbians.”

The NEB’s much-anticipated ruling is the culmination of its rebooted review of the Trans Mountain expansion project. The federal government now owns and operates the project after purchasing it from Kinder Morgan in May 2018.

“We have to not let it be politicized. We have to make sure we get it right so when the project starts again, which I hope will happen, that it stays going and shovels stay in the ground.”

She said her NDP government will continue to pressure Ottawa to properly complete consultations with Indigenous groups.

But she said she is “cautiously optimistic” about the project’s future, calling the NEB’s conditions and recommendations “achievable,” and not something that will hold up construction.

In Alberta, the writ could drop for a provincial election any day, and Notley said she doesn’t expect to see Ottawa approve the pipeline before that campaign begins.

Friday’s NEB report comes just months before a federal election, when issues around Alberta’s oilsands, the environment and climate change and economic development will likely be at the fore as the Liberal government in Ottawa defends its record on one of its most controversial files.

In response, in September, the federal government instructed the NEB to reconsider its recommendation to approve the project. This time, it asked the board to examine the impacts of increased marine shipping traffic on the species at risk, including critically endangered southern resident orcas.

In August, a federal court overturned the expansion’s approval, saying the federal government’s attempts to consult First Nations were flawed and it had ignored the risks posed by oil tankers.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman also vowed that the government would “continue to assert our right to defend B.C.’s environment in court.”

The Alberta government, business groups and some First Nations leaders see the project as a major economic opportunity. Other First Nations, the B.C. government, environmental groups and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby are concerned about its impact on the environment, and its infringement on the rights of Indigenous groups who haven’t consented.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney shot back that the NDP government hasn’t done enough to combat opponents to the pipeline, including the B.C. government and “their special-interest allies.”

“We should not celebrate this as some great victory. What we should do is ask ourselves, ‘How is it that we ended up in this situation?’”

However, Kenney also inaccurately claimed that the NEB added “16 more conditions ... that did not exist before” when, in fact, Friday’s NEB ruling removed one of the conditions issued in its previous report, and the 16 recommendations aren’t legally binding, meaning they do not technically have to be met for the project to continue.

The NEB report is one of the factors the federal government will consider when deciding whether to move forward with the project. Cabinet has 90 days to make the decision, but it’s possible that they will ask for an extension.

But Mount Royal University policy studies professor Duane Bratt said that decision is essentially a foregone conclusion.

“I can’t imagine how the government would not approve this given that they approved the previous NEB report that got quashed by the courts, and they own the pipeline,” he said.

“How do you reject a project that you own and that now has been approved by the regulator?”

Bratt said he expects to see further legal challenges to the project.

Tzeporah Berman, spokesperson for environmental non-profit Stand.earth, issued that message to the federal government Friday.

“If you rush a decision … ignoring Indigenous rights, climate and the threat to orcas, we will see you on the campaign trail this year, in the streets and in the courts,” she said.

Federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Friday that a decision on the pipeline will be made “once we are satisfied that the Crown has adequately fulfilled its duty to consult.”

The Trans Mountain expansion would involve building a second 1,000-kilometre pipeline from Sherwood Park, just outside of Edmonton, Alta., to Burnaby, B.C., following a similar route as an existing one that has been there since 1953. It would increase the pipeline’s capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day.

According to the NEB, benefits of the pipeline include jobs created across Canada, “considerable revenues” for governments and more market access for Canadian oil.

The report also says the regulator considers response planning for an oil spill “adequate.” A large spill would cause major adverse effects, it adds, but “such an event is not likely.”

In an interview with the Star on Friday morning, federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, MP for Saanich-Gulf Islands in B.C., questioned why the NEB did not consider an economic report submitted by Unifor, a union that represents many workers in the oil sector, including the oilsands. That report alleged the project is exaggerating the number of jobs and economic benefits of the project.

“I will be demanding of cabinet and in the House (of Commons) how the NEB thinks the economic benefits — that they have never studied — outweigh the significant negative impacts they found,” May said. “They say it will be jobs all over Canada — find me a study that says that.”

Chief Judy Wilson, elected leader of Neskonlith First Nation near Chase, B.C., said the Federal Court of Appeal’s order that Ottawa redo consultations has not been satisfied. Simply speaking to elected leaders like her is not truly representative of the Indigenous community on a given territory, she said, and the Supreme Court has affirmed that.

The Trans Mountain pipeline runs through the larger Indigenous nation of Wilson’s people, the Secwepemc Nation. But the various elected band councils in the nation have seen some sign agreements with Trans Mountain, while others remain opposed.

“What I’m hearing from some of the others, who have signed, I feel they’re coming from a place under duress,” she said, speaking in Vancouver on Friday. “It will provide them some money to deal with the needs in their communities, but in our community the elders were very clear: It’s about the water, about protecting the Earth and the salmon, over any monetary decision.”

Reacting to Friday’s NEB ruling, Eugene Kung, a lawyer for Vancouver-based West Coast Environmental Law, questioned whether the federal regulator’s decision to recommend the project could truly be considered independent, given the federal government’s $4.5-billion purchase of the project.

“The process was a foregone conclusion from the start, from the rushed timeline, to the refusal to consider the economic and climate change case,” Kung told the Star in a phone interview.

The B.C. government is still before the courts with a reference case seeking a ruling on whether it has the right — as it says it does — under Canada’s Constitution to restrict what flows through the province. The Constitution does allow the federal government jurisdiction over interprovincial infrastructure, however, it also gives provinces the power to regulate for the environment.

That case has not yet been decided, and the B.C. NDP remains staunchly opposed to diluted bitumen flowing through the 66-year-old, 1,110-kilometre oil pipeline from Alberta.

“Before any cabinet decision is made, I would expect and hope this government make its business case public because it’s now the public’s money, and be transparent about how it’s being spent. That’s the opposite of what the NEB has done. The NEB has just created more distrust. It’s an industry-captured regulator.”

The NEB heard from 118 intervenors at a reconsideration hearing, including 52 Indigenous groups and individuals and eight federal government departments. Another 81 intervenors filed written evidence, the board said.

The board also held 25 individual sessions in Calgary, Victoria and Nanaimo for Indigenous intervenors to discuss their concerns orally.

Premier Rachel Notley spoke at Chinook Regional Hospital on Saturday afternoon, criticizing comments made by UCP Leader Jason Kenney earlier in the week, when he said he was open to competition and allowing some private companies to perform publicly funded health-care procedures.

Kenney raised concern on Twitter that the premier was holding a partisan news conference in a public hospital, which is against Alberta Health Services policy.

""It is an unethical abuse of public resources for the NDP Leader to hold a partisan news conference in a public hospital, as she did today. Those are party, not government signs,"" he wrote.

NDP says event was in public area and not funded by tax dollars

Notley's spokesperson, Cheryl Oates, responded to Kenney on Twitter, saying the announcement was done in a public area of the hospital and no tax dollars were spent to do it.

""The event was done in a public area of the hospital, but we understand the concern and will ensure future campaign events are not done at AHS facilities.""

UCP house leader Jason Nixon issued a release Sunday, calling for an investigation.

""Saturday's NDP campaign event was not just a clear violation of AHS policy, but it also seems probable that the Premier and her staff broke Government of Alberta rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital,"" Nixon said in a release.

""I have written to Alberta's Ethics Commissioner to ask for an immediate investigation into this event and I'm calling on Alberta Health Services and the premier's office to explain this clear violation of AHS policy for the benefit of the Notley NDP.""

Saturday was just the most recent incident of Kenney accusing the NDP of campaigning before dropping the writ for the spring election campaign.

This, the department said in a statement, is to keep a record of unemployed qualified graduates in the two fields.

""This call serves as a response to the broader government goal of facilitating access to employment and economic opportunities for young people in the country.

""This will be a pool of all unemployed social work graduates who will be considered for employment opportunities, irrespective of the source of funding for their studies.

""The database will also help to inform the department about the number of unemployed social work graduates, who have studied outside the Social Development Scholarship Programme, thus enabling efficient planning and the inclusion of all social work graduates into the government recruitment system,"" said department spokesperson Lumka Oliphant.

Provincial Departments of Social Development were from 2013 unable to absorb social work graduates into the system due to a lack of funding. This led to the current backlog and an increase in the number of unemployed social workers and auxiliary social workers.

""Since implementation of the scholarship programme in 2007, provincial Departments of Social Development were able to absorb social work graduates. However, since 2013, provincial departments were unable to absorb social work graduates due to lack of funding and this led to the current backlog in the absorption of social work professionals,"" Oliphant said.

By the end January 2019, a total of 3 969 social work graduates, who benefited from the social work scholarship programme, were still unemployed.

""It should be noted that this figure excluded those who funded their studies through other loans, bursaries and other means, hence the call for registration in the database.

""Government, through the Department of Social Development, is aiming to develop an interdepartmental human resources planning and management strategy,"" said Oliphant.

The strategy is to be informed by the National Development Plan (NDP) vision, which encompasses the employment of social workers as part of 55 000 social service practitioners to be required in the country by the end of the year 2030.

Social workers and auxiliary social workers, who qualify and are interested in registering on the database, are encouraged to manually submit a correctly completed registration form to their respective provincial Department of Social Development offices. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.

There are clearly marked deposit boxes at district and service offices within various provinces.

Registration forms can be accessed from all official Department of Social Development online platforms including www.dsd.gov.za, Facebook Page @SocialDevelopmentZA and Twitter @The_DSD.

The database forms can be downloaded as follows:

- Social Auxiliary Worker - FORM B

355,Empty,2019-02-25T16:15:46Z,Jennifer McKenzie has resigned as leader of the New Brunswick NDP a day after members voted for a leadership review.,"Jennifer McKenzie, who tried to move the New Brunswick NDP back to its socialist roots, has resigned as party leader, a day after members voted to hold a leadership convention before the end of August.

In a statement Monday, McKenzie said she was resigning ""effective immediately.""

""The NDP has by a vote this week determined that there will be a leadership convention within the next six months,"" she said. ""I have decided not to participate in such a leadership contest.""

McKenzie has been leader since August 2017 and led the party to a dismal showing in the provincial election last September, when the NDP won no seats.

On Sunday at Moncton's Darts Club, 95 delegates took part in the vote on whether to hold a leadership convention.

The vote was close, with 52 in favour and 43 against, said Danny Légère, who holds a labour seat on the NDP provincial council. He said the results of the 2018 election definitely affected the leadership review.

""At the end of the day, there are some who feel that leadership may be a factor in that,"" he said.

In a Monday afternoon scrum, Jennifer McKenzie told reporters she's proud of the work she did before resigning as leader of the NDP. (CBC)

In a Monday afternoon scrum, McKenzie admitted she was surprised by the result and said she's ""not part of that vision"" of where the party wants to go.

Despite the vote Sunday, McKenzie could have remained leader until a convention, when she could have run against other candidates to try to keep the post. But she chose to resign immediately and said she won't run again for the leadership.

In her statement, McKenzie said she was ""thankful,"" for the opportunity to be leader. Despite the disappointing results of the Sept. 24 election, she said she was glad that the party had a full slate of candidates and that more than 50 per cent of them were women.

McKenzie finished third in Saint John Harbour, the riding represented by the last NDP member of the legislature, Elizabeth Weir, who retired from politics in 2005.

In 2018, the NDP received more than 19,000 votes provincewide, a 60 per cent drop from 2014 and its worst result in a New Brunswick election in 44 years.

McKenzie campaigned on a return to the NDP's socialist beginnings, promising universal childcare, pay equity, home care, better nursing home ratios and pharmacare.

This was a shift from what former leader Dominic Cardy pushed for. He alienated some people by endorsing the Energy East pipeline and distancing himself from unions. He's now a minister in the Progressive Conservative government.

NDP members met at Moncton's Dart Club Sunday night, and voted to hold a leadership convention within the next six months. (Danny Légère/Submitted)

""I was the new kid on the block, and the party was renewing itself and going back to its socialist roots,"" McKenzie said ""That is something that's quite new and different. We haven't seen that for a long time in this province and it's going to take some time to sell.""

In 2018, the NDP received five per cent of the popular vote, down from 11 per cent when Cardy was leader.

The NDP appears to have missed the wave that propelled the two other alternative parties (the Green Party and People's Alliance) to greater success. The Greens had 11 per cent and the Alliance had 12 per cent of the popular vote last election, and each won three ridings.

McKenzie said people may have chosen Green over NDP because there has been confusion about what sets them apart.

""[The Greens] are not a socialist party, they're not a party to the left,"" she said. ""Because we haven't had a lot of socialism and socialist policy in this province, people did not understand the difference.""

4 leaders in 14 years

Since Weir resigned in 2005, the NDP has had four leaders, including McKenzie, who ran for the leadership unopposed.

No date has been set for the leadership convention, which has to be held in the next six months.

The vote was by secret ballot, Légère said, but some people did voice their disagreement with the results.

""Some felt that we shouldn't be changing leaders as often as we do. It wasn't good for the party, that we needed consistency. Some felt otherwise.""

Legislature is an opportunity to reopen discussion on MLA term limits, says Green Party leader Andrew Weaver.","The alleged spending scandal at the B.C. legislature is an opportunity to reopen discussion on MLA term limits, says Green Party leader Andrew Weaver.

Weaver introduced a private member's bill on Thursday that, if passed, would limit MLAs to three terms.

""We start to see issues emerge when people have been [in office] a long time, and we are seeing that play out right now in the B.C. Legislature,"" he told the host of CBC's On The Coast.

Weaver clarified that he was referring to the alleged misuse of taxpayers' money by senior legislature staff. He said problems are more likely to arise when long-time MLAs become complacent.

Time for 'rejuvenation'

Several prominent members of the legislature have been in office since the 1990s.

Former speaker Linda Reid has been a B.C. Liberal MLA since 1991. Former B.C. Liberal deputy premier Rich Coleman was first elected in 1996 and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth has only missed one term since he was first elected in 1991.

Weaver said term limits would allow a new generation of MLAs to come forward with new ideas and tools to shape public policy.

""We need to foster innovation, we need to foster new ideas and that doesn't happen unless there's a rejuvenation of the place,"" he said.

Liberal MLA says bill ill-conceived

The bill passed its first reading with every MLA in favour except one, B.C. Liberal Ralph Sultan, who was first elected in 2001.

Sultan said protocol dictates that many private member bills are voted through unanimously at the first round but he broke with etiquette in protest of what he called ""grandstanding,"" by Weaver.

Sultan called the bill ill-conceived and said good government needs a balance of rookies and old-timers.

""If you had a three-term limit the entire NDP front bench would be decimated, you'd have no Carole James, no John Horgan, no Adrian Dix and I say government would be much the poorer as a result, so experience does count for something.""

This is not the first time Weaver has raised the question of term limits; he brought a similar bill forward in 2017.

Weaver said the BC Liberals decided not to bring the bill for debate that year, but he hopes this year's bill will see the light of day again.

The ""Don't Steal #OURsubway Day of Action"" was organized by the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 — which represents some 11,500 TTC workers — along with the union-connected transit advocacy group TTCriders and the Toronto Labour Council.

Participants handed out flyers to subway riders in an effort to raise awareness about the impending upload, while ATU Local 113 members wore T-shirts over their uniforms that read ""Don't Steal Our Subway"" while on the job.

""Ripping the TTC Subway from the rest of our public transit system will create havoc for riders, add unnecessary bureaucracy to our system and take local control away from city transit planning,"" said Carlos Santos, president of the union.

Shelagh Pizey-Allen, spokesperson for TTCriders, said the group hopes to encourage transit users to ""call the premier, call their MPP and tell them: 'Don't steal our subway, fund it instead.""

Last year, the Progressive Conservative provincial government announced that it intends to take over ownership of Toronto's subway network. The province would control construction of subway infrastructure and maintenance, while the city would keep revenue generated by the subway system.

Transportation Minister Jeff Yurek has argued the upload would allow for a more efficient expansion of the existing network. Earlier this month, the province and city have reached ""terms of reference"" for negotiations for the upload.

The plan is bitterly opposed by some transit riders, city councillors and the provincial NDP. They argue that the city needs to maintain its control over subways to ensure that it has a say in future development of transit and other infrastructure around subway stations.

Protesters carried an effigy of Ontario Premier Doug Ford outside Queen's Park station. (CBC)

The problem is not that the city owns the subways, critics argue, but that the TTC has been chronically underfunded since the mid-1990s, when former premier Mike Harris's government cut provincial subsidies for the service.

Yurek responded to Friday's protest on social media, calling it ""NDP fearmongering.""

""A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Don’t let the NDP fearmongering mislead you. A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/onpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#onpoli</a> <a href=""https://t.co/FAMelnpIqk"">pic.twitter.com/FAMelnpIqk</a> —@JeffYurekMPP

For its part, TTCriders says the upload will result in higher fares, poorer service and generally more ""chaos"" during peak hours.

""There's going to be a loss of accountability if the transit system doesn't stay integrated and in Toronto's hands. Why would an MPP in Parry Sound or Kenora care about investing in our system the way that we need?"" said Pizey-Allen.

Push for public awareness campaign

Toronto councillors Josh Matlow and Joe Cressy intend to introduce a motion next week that would see the city launch a public information campaign ""regarding the importance of retaining control of Toronto's subways.""

The campaign would include ads on TTC vehicles and in stations, as well as a series of public consultations to help residents better understand the consequences of transferring control of the city's subways to the province.

""Torontonians should also know that with Toronto's subway, the province would gain control of lucrative air rights above stations and adjacent properties, owned and paid for by Torontonians,"" reads the motion, titled ""Save Our Subway: Ensuring Torontonians Know the Facts.""

Matlow has also posted an online petition calling for the TTC's subways to remain under the city's ownership.

On Friday, the NEB stated that the project is in the best interest of Canadians, but that if the federal government wants to approve it, they need to consider 16 new recommendations. The board had already made 156 others.

Some of the new recommendations revolve around reducing ferry noise and ensuring the safety of southern resident killer whale populations in the Salish Sea. It's stated in the report that an increase in tanker traffic could hurt not just whales, but also Indigenous culture, while creating more greeenhouse gas emissions.

Red Deer Mayor Tara Veer says the NEB's statement is a positive step in the right direction.

""It is a priority for Red Deerians, Albertans and Canadians to get energy to market, and to ensure the most safe transport of our natural resources,"" she says.

""It's imperative that the federal government fulfill the additional consultations with Indigenous persons that are necessary in order to see the project come to fruition.""

Veer also touched on the announcement this week from Alberta Opposition leader Jason Kenney that he would shelve Premier Rachel Notley's plan to use rail cars while we wait for a pipeline.

""I think it's imperative to note that our ultimate objective is pipeline construction, and certainly railway cars highlight the economic desperation in our province,"" says Veer. At best, it is is an interim solution, because the safest and most efficient transport of energy product is by pipeline.""

Rick More, CEO of the Red Deer and District Chamber of Commerce, says he's feeling a lot more confident today that Trans Mountain will get built than before the latest report.

""It's good news, but it was good news last time so I wouldn't get too excited. It's preliminary good news, let's just say that,"" says More.

""Timing wise, for the NDP, they would probably be glad to see this happening, but I dont know where we are with the rail cars if this goes ahead.""

Should Justin Trudeau's cabinet approve the project, it would triple the capacity of the existing line between Edmonton and Burnaby to about 890,000 barrels of oil per day.

A number of Indigenous groups have already stated they will continue to fight in hopes of preventing the expansion project from seeing the light of day.

""This is a new world we're living in and it's time for the city of Toronto to help lead the discourse,"" Coun. Joe Cressy said in an interview at his city hall office.

Cressy, who represents Ward 10, Spadina-Fort York, has put forward a motion that is set to be debated at the next city council meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 26. It calls for city staff to develop a policy on data collection and recommends public consultations be part of the process.

The motion comes as questions continue about a planned development by Sidewalk Labs, a sister company of Google, which proposes a ""smart"" neighbourhood on the waterfront that would also collect data about people's movements.

The proposed development has prompted critics to push for assurances the information collected will not be used to violate people's privacy, but Cressy said that's only part of what led to him to put forward the motion.

If you use your Presto card to take the subway, then hop on a downtown streetcar, for example, the city knows where you've been and the route you took, he said.

The downtown councillor said as new technologies continue to emerge, there will be be many more ways to collect personal information.

The Sidewalk Labs proposal, including heated sidewalks, affordable housing and infrastructure for autonomous vehicles, is planned for Quayside, an undeveloped area east of downtown along Toronto's waterfront.

Sidewalk Labs responds

The company sent CBC a statement.

""We welcome the motion being introduced by Councillor Cressy,"" it reads in part.

""We hope that our project will set a new standard for responsible data use, as articulated in our data proposals we released last year.""

Cressy's motion was released on Thursday, the same day two executives from Waterfront Toronto were questioned by a federal government standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics regarding the Sidewalk Labs proposal.

Before hearing from the executives, an NDP MP who's vice-chair of that committee spoke to CBC's Metro Morning, saying the federal government is keeping a close eye on the Sidewalk Labs proposal.

""What is the financial base of Google's power? It's data,"" Charlie Angus told host Matt Galloway.

Angus referred to ""the rise of this culture of surveillance capitalism"" and said questions need to be asked about the development in what he called ""the most valuable real estate in North America.""

Here's the full interview with Angus:

NDP MP Charlie Angus says Sidewalk Labs should take questions before the House of Commons standing committee on information, privacy and ethics. Angus also describes why he thinks the project should be paused. 8:58

Cressy said he wants the city to have a policy to ensure data collection, use and storage ""is used for the public good, not private gain,"" pointing to other cities, including Barcelona, that have already implemented data governance policies.

He's concerned that personal information could be shared or sold, possibly resulting in ""somebody not getting a bank loan or a life insurance policy or not being accepted into a college or university,"" he said.

When the caller didn't answer his question, he got suspicious.

Hamilton: Can you do me a favour and say, 'Carrot?'

Hamilton: So you're actually a recording?

Caller: Haha. Oh goodness, do I sound that bad?

Hamilton: Kind of.

Hamilton was annoyed that he was having a conversation with a robot — or at least a series of pre-recorded responses being pushed by an operator.

""I'm really irritated by it,"" said Hamilton, a 28-year-old Edmontonian who is volunteering for the NDP in this campaign.

The 2019 provincial election hasn't been called, but parties are already in full campaign mode.

And it's just going to get more intense. Here's what you need to know about the messages and messengers in the 2019 campaign.

Despite the National Do Not Call List, it's not unusual to get calls soliciting political support. And they're completely above-board.

Is the woman who sent this text message really named 'Kate'? We wonder. (James Evans/CBC) In 2019, it's become even more common for parties to reach you by text.

But the effectiveness of such strategies is often questioned.

Najib Jutt, a political strategist with the government relations firm Statecraft Partners, said text messages may be better than phone calls because they're less intrusive and people can deal with the text whenever they want.

But at the end of the day, any campaign that simply blasts information at voters is not very useful, he said.

""You're not convincing people to continue the conversation with their circles, which is really what needs to be done in political campaigning,"" Jutt said.

""People are looking for better engagement …To me, whatever way a candidate or party can really engage with potential voters is where the best spend of money is.""

Telephone town-halls and old-fashioned door-knocking allow voters to ask questions and get answers from real people. But Jutt knows that's sometimes seen as an outdated approach. At this point, most parties really just want data.

New advertisers on the block

This will be the first election cycle where third-party advertisers may have a real impact. Also known as Political Action Committees (PACs), many people are most familiar with these groups in relation to U.S. politics, where they're known for pumping huge amounts of money into elections with no financial restrictions imposed.

A PAC in Alberta is any group that plans to spend at least $1,000 on political advertising. The groups have long existed here — but it was only after an NDP bill put an end to corporate and union political donations that PACs became more important in Alberta politics.

The ""big money"" aspect of these groups applies in Alberta, too, with some of these groups raising more than $1 million per year.

""Third-parties do have to identify who they are but they don't have to identify who they're supporting, even though the ads would be pretty clear in that respect,"" said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary.

Last fall, the group Shaping Alberta's Future ran a series of radio advertisements that sounded like a radio call-in show, with callers telling a ""host"" that they ""gotta scrap the carbon tax"" and that they need a leader who ""will stand up for Alberta.""

In November, the group also purchased a wrap-around advertisement that appeared as the front page of the Edmonton Journal.

The website for Shaping Alberta's Future clearly states the group supports conservative politics and UCP Leader Jason Kenney. But the PAC's ties to the Motor Dealers' Association of Alberta have raised controversy and the NDP has asked the province's elections commissioner to investigate its operations.

All donations to third-party advertisers are listed on their financial disclosure forms, which are published on elections.alberta.ca

Meanwhile, groups such as the Alberta Teachers' Association, which will not support a particular political party but will run ads on election issues, are also listed as third-party advertisers. The ATA raised about $270,000 between December and February.

We love to hate

Despite calls from political parties to keep the campaign civil, there's ample evidence that negative ads will play a role.

""Research has shown that negative ads work and that's why they continue to be used,"" Bratt said.

The NDP has published an aggressive website called ""The Truth About Jason Kenney,"" with ominous black, white and red imagery and direct attacks on the UCP leader's political history.

The NDP's new website isn't exactly subtle in its criticisms of Jason Kenney. (thetruthaboutjasonkenney.ca)

Bratt also warned the election is likely to see the rise of anonymous Twitter accounts — which operate in a medium where direct attacks on political opponents are an almost natural part of the discourse.

The Unite Alberta account on Twitter started as a pro-Jason Kenney account before the Progressive Conservatives and Wildrose voted to come together. The account was known for aggressive comments and it was unclear who was writing the tweets.

The account has since shifted and is now identified as the official account of Jason Kenney's office. It more recently courted controversy by publishing a list of people it said were NDP staff, trying to highlight partisan tweets from government staff during their work hours.

Since many NDP staffers seem to spend their days (and nights) tweeting, have attempted to create a Twitter list using public data. Some openly disclose that they work for the NDP Govt, but others do not reveal (trying to look organic?). <a href=""https://t.co/MK6ZEJB6Cx"">https://t.co/MK6ZEJB6Cx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ableg</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/abpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#abpoli</a> —@UniteAlberta

I would love to know two things:<br>1. Why create this list, other than with the hope that followers target those named?<br>2. Imagine the backlash if the NDP had an account like this that did something like this. What would the UCP say about it?<br>The hypocrisy isn’t lost on me. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABleg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ABleg</a> <a href=""https://t.co/pxLLoQH33i"">https://t.co/pxLLoQH33i</a> —@CalgaryToday

Jutt, the political strategist, doesn't think attack ads are as effective as some parties might hope.

""I think there's a better way. I think there's a way to convince people that your approach, that your way is just better,"" he said. ""People are informed … let me decide because you do such a great job engaging and you're so good with your messaging, it doesn't matter what the other guys say.""

Fake news is a real thing

There's no shortage of political coverage on the Internet. So with mainstream media outlets, and well-established blogs, meme generators and Facebook posters, it's likely even the most discerning reader can be duped by something that's completely fabricated.

But Jane Lytvynenko, a BuzzFeed breaking news reporter and writer of a weekly Fake News Quiz, says readers who genuinely want to learn about events need to be even more careful about stories that have some elements of truth — and many more elements of slant and opinion.

Jane Lytvynenko writes a weekly quiz to test people on their ability to detect fake news stories. (BuzzFeed)

""Look for headline and image combinations designed to spark anger,"" Lytvynenko said. ""Is the image of a politician that's attached to the story have their face distorted in almost a caricature kind of way? Is the headline giving me just enough information to be angry?

""As you read the story, is there any original reporting in there? Did the public actually speak to the parties involved that they're promoting, or is it more of an overview with an opinion slant?""

All that advice, however, will only be useful to people who want to think critically about the media they're consuming.

A charter school in northwest Calgary is urging the premier to take action to fix its dilapidated building.

The Foundations for the Future Charter Academy was initially approved for modernization in 2012. But two years later, an engineer's report found the publicly funded school in Montgomery would be too expensive to fix and needed a total replacement, says board chair Jeff Wilson.

""There's cracks in the masonry, there's sinkholes appearing,"" he said, adding that the condition of the building has become a health and safety issue.

Under the NDP government, no progress has been made, and every year that nothing gets done, the building falls into more disrepair, he says.

""And I think that that's probably the biggest fear of our entire community because what then? The minister of education will have to find a home for 840 students overnight and there's not just extra high schools kicking around,"" Wilson said.

""In this school, we clearly have a shrinking timeline, and that's why I think regardless of an election year or not this is an issue that needs to be raised and needs to be addressed.""

Wilson says he believes the inaction could be due to the fact that it's a charter school.

In a statement, Education Minister David Eggen says his department is working with the public and Catholic school boards to try to find a new space for the students. And he says the province remains committed to the project.

But Wilson says he's skeptical that the province is serious about taking action, and suggested it's the premier's office preventing Eggen from doing so.

""He alone holds the hammer, and, unfortunately, by his own admission, the premier has tied his hands behind his back,"" Wilson said.

He says a letter from Eggen suggested both sides should continue to meet and discuss solutions — an approach Wilson says has been frustratingly unproductive since the NDP took power.

""It would appear that the government of the day is only interested in doing the same thing over and over again,"" he said.

Wilson says he's frustrated that his school's needs get ignored while other schools are modernized or new ones built.

""We're a part of the education community in this city. We just want our students, who are Alberta students, to be treated that way. It's that simple.""

363,Empty,2019-02-25T20:59:03Z,Her intention was apparently to use hospital space to trash her opponent. It was obviously improper and literally indefensible,"We bring you word today of a modest pre-election kerfuffle in Alberta, an event perhaps no bigger than the breath of a butterfly. On Saturday, New Democratic premier Rachel Notley, who will be up for re-election in the next few months, made an appearance at the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge. A premier can find a lot of excuses to visit a hospital. The election campaign has not yet officially begun, and I do not suppose anybody would have done more than grumble if Notley cooked up some pretext for a meeting with health workers, or perhaps even a photo-op with some shiny new sci-fi equipment purchased with government dollars.

But when the premier’s comms team announced Friday that Notley would be using hospital space to “make a statement and answer questions in response to Jason Kenney’s recently announced plans to freeze health care spending and explore privatization of Alberta’s health care system,” that attracted attention. Notley’s intention was apparently to use hospital space to trash her main electoral opponent.

And she did exactly that, with uniformed hospital staff clustered around her. She spoke surrounded by signage that did not read “Government of Alberta,” or anything nonpartisan of the kind, but that instead had the party slogan that is already appearing on NDP election signs around the province: “Rachel Notley. Fighting For You.”

There was no effort at all to give Notley's visit a phony nonpartisan character

This event was obviously improper and literally indefensible. Alberta Health Services, the authority which operates the province’s hospitals, has a policy that is pretty clear. If AHS lacked such a policy, Notley’s action would still be both gross and dumb; but it has one. And that policy says that “AHS facilities shall not be used for any political activity, including, but not limited to, use for the purposes of canvassing, campaigning, making political announcements, touring, and other activities.”

To the degree that there is any exploitable ambiguity about this rule, which is not restricted to official campaign periods, Notley’s communications brainiacs seem to have gone out of their way to destroy it. There was no effort at all to give Notley’s visit a phony nonpartisan character. Her intention to attack a political opponent was explicitly declared. Notley’s communications director Cheryl Oates kinda-sorta-quasi-non-apologized for the event, tweeting “we understand the concern and will ensure future campaign events are not done at AHS facilities.” Conservatives were not slow to notice that Oates had seemingly admitted that the premier had indeed held a “campaign event” in violation of AHS policy.

Alberta has a law mandating fixed election periods, but not specific dates. This provides enough elasticity to allow a premier to hop around the province weeks before an election, making generous infrastructure announcements while keeping the starter’s pistol in its holster. Notley is doing just this, and it is in line with Alberta’s traditions. The Chinook Hospital appearance was a subtly higher, less-familiar level of banana republicanism. Even a Progressive Conservative government of the bad old days would probably have had second thoughts about organizing a Two Minutes’ Hate against the opposition leader in a hospital atrium.

Those bad old days were pretty bad, when it came to politicians of the government party preening with, on and within public works and abusing institutions to obtain re-election. One legitimate reason to vote for Notley’s New Democrats is — or was — that they put a stop to the worst excesses of this sort. Certainly no one should expect a premier or any other politician to behave like a saint. Scheduling pork announcements for maximum convenience and making use of control over the election date: these are all in the game. Even the NDP’s emerging strategy of making the election brutally personal is to be expected. You know I have never been a pious ninny about “negative campaigning.”

But this is a case in which stupidity is the generous explanation for a premier’s conduct — walking into that hospital, seeing the campaign signs, going ahead with the press conference, and never sensing a problem of optics (the politician’s euphemism for “ethics”). More likely she just didn’t care, because the breach of policy will be litigated, and the reporters’ barrage of freedom-of-information requests answered, only after the election.

Moreover, as I write this, there hasn’t been any sign of an actual apology for the Chinook fiasco, as opposed to a promise that it will not happen again now that the NDP has gotten the benefit from it once (in a city that is bound to be in play electorally). Indeed, the New Democrats seem determined to campaign further on the incident, emphasizing how frightened those poor nurses are of the hatchet-wielding monster Jason Kenney. Albertans have never watched a New Democratic government run for re-election, but B.C. and Saskatchewan know what it looks like when the party of labour triumphant pulls out all the stops. It’s not likely to get prettier.

But the combination of no guidelines, much leeway, and the Speaker himself going along with some of the spending, poses a challenge in employment law in the matter of firing.","VICTORIA — Along with much well-placed indignation, Speaker Darryl Plecas mustered some effective sarcasm in his second report on the suspended senior officers at the legislature.

For instance, his send-up of an August 2017 business junket between B.C. and Washington state, led by clerk of the legislature Craig James along with sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz.

The James version dressed up part of the trip as a fact-finding tour on earthquake and tsunami preparedness, despite including a whale-watching trip in Victoria and attendance at a Seattle Mariners baseball game.

“Mr. James writes, ‘we were offered tickets to a baseball game,’” as Plecas put it in one of his more droll passages.

“That is only true to the extent that all members of the public are technically ‘offered’ tickets to events in exchange for full payment.”

B.C. paid for 13 tickets to the Major League Baseball game at a cost of more than $1,000.

Nothing funny about it from a taxpayer point of view, as Plecas himself acknowledged: “If this weren’t so serious, it would be the stuff of comedy.”

But it does raise the question of how the legislature should proceed in light of the two Plecas reports with their evidence of a sense of entitlement gone wild.

James and Lenz have denied any wrongdoing, nor have they been charged, never mind convicted.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

Still, the clerk and sergeant-at-arms were appointed by the legislature, they were suspended with full pay by the legislature, and they could be fired by the legislature.

All it would take is for government house leader Mike Farnworth to table a motion to that effect. With leave, it could be voted on immediately and the deed would be done.

But there would also be consequences, legal, financial and otherwise.

The positions of clerk and sergeant-at-arms both come with considerable leeway and few guidelines.

The legislature, 25 years ago, deliberately exempted the senior officers from oversight by LAMC, the legislative assembly management committee. The committee, urged six years ago to add those positions to its purview, neglected to do so.

All of which sets up a problem that Plecas himself alluded to in the later passages of his second report.

“The most charitable interpretation of all of this is that Mr. James and Mr. Lenz really did, and do, consider that all these activities — the innumerable business continuity meetings and trips; the myriad of purchases; the electronics; the benefits and bonuses, and so on — were all proper and necessary business expenses,” he wrote.

He was quick to add: “I disagree, and I expect the vast majority of ordinary British Columbians do, too.”

I expect he’s right about the public reaction.

But the combination of no guidelines, much leeway, and the Speaker himself going along with some of the spending, poses a challenge in employment law in the matter of firing.

Wisely, LAMC has put on retainer Marcia McNeil, a Victoria-based expert in employment law. Readers may recall her as the author of a devastating post-mortem on the health firings, the workplace debacle that played out over several years in the B.C. Liberal government.

I gather her advice to proceed cautiously contributed to the carefully phrased motion passed by LAMC at the end of a more than 2½-hour and mostly in-camera meeting Thursday.

The motion from NDP house leader Farnworth called on the committee to first prepare “a list of specific areas of concern” arising from the two reports from the Speaker as well as the written responses and legal submission from the two senior officers.

Once the list of concerns is complete, Farnworth and house leaders Mary Polak of the Liberals and Sonia Furstenau of the Greens are to “develop and recommend an independent review process conducted by an eminent jurist.”

The jurist, probably a retired judge of the Supreme Court, would be asked “to determine if the clerk or sergeant-at-arms has engaged in misconduct in the course of carrying out their duties.”

The findings would be submitted “for consideration and adoption by the legislative assembly.”

Plecas left not much doubt that if it were up to him, they would already be fired.

Near the end of his report, he wrote that if James and Lenz really do think that what they did was proper and necessary, “I believe it shows a lack of judgment, and a repeated pattern of decision-making that is utterly unacceptable in senior executives of a public institution.”

But Plecas is not in charge of the matter anymore, as the Farnworth motion made explicit: “The Speaker voluntarily stated that he shall recuse himself from any development or oversight of the independent review process.”

In a followup media conference, Farnworth, speaking for all three leaders, made a point of emphasizing the recusal, strongly suggesting it was the end of Plecas’s involvement in the affair.

But that didn’t stop the Speaker’s right-hand man, chief of staff Alan Mullen, from calling a news conference Friday to predict that the eminent jurist thing should be wrapped up in 10 days or so and meanwhile more exposé reports were in the works.

“British Columbians are screaming loud and clear, ‘Please don’t stop, please keep going,’” said Mullen. “And oh my goodness, are we going to keep going? Well that’s a big yes.”

Just when the three house leaders thought they’d finally got a lid on things.

The regulator imposed 156 conditions on the project (it listed 157 conditions when it first approved the project in May 2016) while also handing Ottawa 16 new non-binding recommendations it says would help mitigate marine safety risks that could result from an expanded shipping terminal near Burnaby, B.C.

Robert Steedman, the chief environmental officer of the NEB, said Friday that conditions in the Salish Sea along B.C.'s coastline are already so badly degraded from centuries of human activity that the addition of just one more tanker per day would have a minor impact on the endangered southern resident killer whale population.

Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi welcomed the NEB's report calling it a ""major milestone"" and said Ottawa is committed to doing the ""hard work necessary to move forward in the right way on TMX.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet have 90 days to respond to the NEB report — they can either approve it or kill the taxpayer-owned project outright.

But despite the legislatively mandated response time, Ottawa has said it will not impose constraints on Indigenous consultation efforts — meaning a firm date for a final decision remains elusive.

The NEB re-do was prompted by a Federal Court of Appeal decision last summer that quashed the Trudeau government's initial cabinet approval of the expanded pipeline, sending Ottawa back to the drawing board on two key matters: Indigenous consultation and marine-related environmental assessment.

The 1,150-kilometre expansion project would nearly triple the existing pipeline's capacity to 890,000 barrels a day. It would allow pipeline shipments from Alberta's oilpatch to coastal B.C., and then to markets in Asia. Tanker traffic from the Westridge Marine Terminal would increase from about five vessels a month to one a day.

With pipeline capacity severely constrained, oilpatch boosters have long demanded a new pipeline to tidewater that would allow Canadian producers to fetch prices closer to the going world rate for oil — which could boost government revenue.

According to research from the nonpartisan Conference Board of Canada, an expanded Trans Mountain would lead to 802,000 person-years of employment and $46.7 billion in government revenue over the next 20 years.

The think-tank estimates that most of those gains would come about through higher prices for Canadian oil.

'We categorically disagree'

The NEB announcement doesn't mean the project is in the clear. Environmentalists and other project opponents warn a spill on the coast would be disastrous and say increased greenhouse gas emissions driven by pipeline exports could threaten Canada's commitment to the Paris agreement on climate change.

Anti-oilsands activist Tzeporah Berman, who works with the Standearth green advocacy group, said the project ""is not in the public interest and will never be built.""

Judy Wilson, chief of the Neskonlith First Nation and secretary treasurer of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said the coalition of B.C. Indigenous peoples opposed to the pipeline expansion will not back down in the face of the regulator's approval.



""We categorically disagree with the National Energy Board,"" she said. ""We still say no to the project. Not only did they not listen to the Indigenous concerns, they're not even listening to our orcas.""

(Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

The Federal Court of Appeal said the NEB, in its initial May 2016 recommendation report, did not adequately address the impact a substantial increase in tanker traffic could have on area whales, or the threat of a spill of diluted bitumen from a tanker.

""Today, following an intensive 22-week reconsideration process, the NEB submitted its report on the project with an overall recommendation that the Trans Mountain expansion project is in the Canadian public interest and should be approved ... This report marks an important milestone as the government follows the Federal Court of Appeal's guidance,"" Sohi said.

""Moving forward, the [cabinet] will make a decision on TMX once we are satisfied that the Crown has adequately fulfilled its duty to consult. We are hopeful the work we are doing will put us in a strong position to make a decision within the NEB's legislated timeframe.""

Dooming whales 'to oblivion'

While the federal Liberals vowed to be guided by the NEB in approaching the project, B.C. NDP MP Murray Rankin said the regulator's decision was ""not acceptable"" and compared its recommendations to mitigate the project's risks to ""changing the deck chairs on the Titanic.""

""They're prepared to consign the southern resident killer whales to oblivion. Perhaps that's in the national interest where you live, but it's certainly not where we live,"" Rankin said, adding he suspects there will be further legal action against the project.

""I can predict with confidence environmental organizations are not going to take this sitting down,"" the Victoria-area MP said.

NDP MP Murray Rankin and Conservative MP conservative Jamie Schmale react to the decision by the National Energy Board over its approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. 1:08

Conservative MP Shannon Stubbs, the party's natural resources critic, said the NEB decision is good news for the many energy workers who have faced layoffs in recent months due to historically low oil prices — but she demanded a clearer timeline from the Liberal government on when construction of the project would resume.

""Today's recommendation from the National Energy Board, while positive, does not get us anywhere closer to the pipeline getting built. All it does is put the decision back in the hands of the same Liberal cabinet that failed to start construction in the first place,"" she said.

The original proponent of the expansion, Kinder Morgan, halted all essential spending last spring after the B.C. NDP government launched a series of legal manoeuvres designed to thwart construction.

Amid the uncertainty, Ottawa agreed to buy the project for $4.5 billion. On the very day Kinder Morgan shareholders agreed to sell most of the company's Canadian assets to Ottawa, the Federal Court of Appeal quashed approvals, demanding changes before construction could resume.

The court found the federal government's Phase 3 consultation process with Indigenous peoples was a ""failure.""

Neskonlith Chief Judy Wilson says Indigenous concerns were not taken into account over the National Energy Board decision. 1:05

It called federal consultants glorified ""note-takers"" who recorded the concerns of Indigenous communities without acting on them.

The previous Crown consultation team believed, erroneously, that it could not add more conditions to the project than those the National Energy Board (NEB) already imposed as part of its Phase 2 consultation, the court found.

The federal government tapped retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci to lead renewed talks with Indigenous communities. Iacobucci and his team of 60 consultants will be empowered to turn feedback into action where possible.

As of Wednesday, the consultation teams had spoken already with three-quarters of the 117 communities that will be affected by the project's construction.

A Calgary justice says the B.C. government should have waited until the law was in force to file the constitutional challenge, saying the claim was both ""premature and inappropriate for consideration by the court.""

B.C. filed the statement of claim in Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench in May 2018, challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act.

The act, also known as Bill 12, gained royal assent on May 18, 2018, but has not yet come into force on proclamation.

It requires exporters to obtain licenses, and gives Alberta's energy minister the power to decide how much fuel is exported, how it's transported — by pipeline, rail or tanker truck — and whether direct shipments to be stopped altogether.

""The Government of Alberta introduced and supported the Act because it asserts British Columbia is responsible for ""delays"" to an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline … Alberta seeks to utilize powers under the Act to punish British Columbia, and to exert pressure upon British Columbia,"" B.C.'s statement of claim reads.

B.C. said a significant percentage of the fuel it consumes comes from Alberta. It adds any disruption could cause irreparable harm, both to the economy and to health and safety in remote communities that depend on a reliable fuel supply.

B.C. could resubmit once bill is proclaimed

But Calgary Justice R.J. Hall, in a decision dated Friday, said the claim of B.C.'s attorney general was made too early as the bill hasn't actually been proclaimed yet.

""Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the [Attorney General of B.C.] may recommence a claim,"" Hall wrote.

Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said the government is pleased the challenge was struck down.

""This law remains available if necessary. In the meantime, we're encouraged by Friday's NEB decision and are taking decisive action to move more oil by rail until new pipelines are built … we call on the Government of BC to recognize our shared interest in moving our natural resources to new markets as we support their efforts to export LNG,"" she said.

The bill is just one of the province's weapons in its political battle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which Alberta's NDP-led government has accused B.C.'s NDP-led government of blocking.

""Albertans, British Columbians and all Canadians should understand that if the path forward for the pipeline through B.C. is not settled soon, I am ready and prepared to turn off the taps,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said when the bill passed last May.

On Friday, the National Energy Board reiterated its approval of the $7.4-billion pipeline with new recommendations to protect the environment in B.C.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman took to Twitter to reiterate B.C.'s concerns with the project.

This project is not in the best interests of the tens of thousands of people who depend on our coast for their livelihoods.<br><br>We're going to continue to assert our right to defend BC's env't in court & will continue to insist the federal gov't take BC's concerns seriously. —@GeorgeHeyman

Police say they've closed an investigation dating back to spring 2017. That's when investigators started looking into claims that an HWAD nomination meeting was rigged in favour of federal Conservative staffer Ben Levitt when it should actually have gone to local lawyer Vikram Singh.

Investigators say they uncovered forms that ""appeared to have been falsified"" from the credentials table, where Singh and challenger Jeff Peller have always maintained party officials tipped the scales in Levitt's favour. They even found that one person who appeared to have voted that night died a week earlier.

The forms from the credentials table were ""all marked in what appeared to be a similar manner.... These ballots were all votes for Ben Levitt,"" said police. Police said they interviewed people named on the forms and found they didn't actually attend the meeting and did not vote.

Police seized more than 61 items as evidence, including 1,800 PC Party ballots, 345 credentials referral forms and 1,648 pages of email correspondence. They also interviewed nearly 150 witnesses from multiple jurisdictions and executed 15 judicial authorizations.

But in the end, police say, there wasn't enough to charge anyone.

""Hamilton police have reviewed the matter with the Crown Attorney and at this time, there is insufficient evidence to proceed with the laying of criminal charges,"" police said in a media release Monday.

""During the extensive investigation, several persons of interest were identified. Two arrests were made, but those individuals were subsequently released unconditionally. Hamilton police have reviewed the matter with the Crown Attorney and at this time, there is insufficient evidence to proceed with the laying of criminal charges.""

Vikram Singh, a local lawyer, won the total of seven other voting tables, but Levitt won based on the credentials table. (vsingh.ca)

Singh isn't upset about the lack of charges, and instead expresses gratitude that volunteers and voters supported him.

""I have full faith in Hamilton Police Service, and the detectives who spent countless hours on what appears to be an extensive and thorough investigation,"" he said.

""This story is something to reflect on, for the public and the electorate, to ensure we improve our system.""

The PC party, meanwhile, said Premier Doug Ford wasn't leader of the party when the nomination battle happened, and fixed the mess when he did become leader.

He was ""elected leader of our party on a promise to clean up the mess left behind by Patrick Brown,"" the party said in an email. ""He took immediate action to set aside the nomination and reopened it under a transparent and fair system.

""Questions surrounding the allegations contained in the police report should be directed to Patrick Brown. ""

The HWAD matter dates back to a May 7, 2017 nomination meeting at Ancaster High School.

Levitt, Singh, Peller and Jobson Easow all wanted to run for the PC party in June 2018 in the newly drawn riding. Police found Singh, a Dundas lawyer, won the combined vote of the seven regular voting tables. Levitt's win mainly came from the credentials table, which was staffed by Dykstra, Stanley and PC staffer Logan Bugeja.

Patrick Brown was still Ontario PC party leader. Singh and Peller appealed to the party to investigate, which the party refused. Both then went to the courts and asked for a judicial review.

In court documents, Dykstra said the party felt Singh ""inspired mistrust"" and ""didn't fit the right demographic."" He also said the party could pick whoever it wanted, regardless of who won at a nomination meeting.

Peller eventually dropped his challenge. Singh continued, and went to court to try to unveil a surreptitiously recorded conversation between himself and some party insiders. The court turned that down, saying the conversation had been part of trying to reach a settlement.

The party was also successful in getting the court to rule that Singh hand over $136,315 for legal costs over the secret recording.

In the end, Singh dropped his challenge too. Levitt asked for another nomination meeting, which he won. Singh wanted to run for that nomination but his application wasn't accepted.

The HWAD incident was just one of several PC nomination challenges at the time. In the end, Brown was ousted from the party following sexual misconduct allegations. Doug Ford became the leader, and eventually premier. NDP candidate Sandy Shaw won HWAD.",Dead person voted but no fraud charges coming after Hamilton police investigation,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hwad-1.5032490

(the BS-Line), this is far from a done deal. The unfolding corruption scandal at SNC-Lavalin and the company’s proprietary role in SkyTrain technology puts this Millennium Line extension in question. The underlying assumptions that have been used to justify the subway also do not add up, regarding projections of growth, ridership or technology performance of various options.

The recommendations for a SkyTrain subway to UBC are based on a report that updates the 2012 SNC-Lavalin/Steer Davies Gleave report. Since SNC-Lavalin is the main supplier of SkyTrain throughout the region, it is not surprising SkyTrain was their recommendation, and since the current update is based on the 2012 report, it would come to the same conclusion again.

The Expo and Millennium Lines are a proprietary unconventional railway, of which the technical patents are owned by Bombardier and the engineering patents owned by SNC-Lavalin.

“Only seven lines have been built in almost 40 years, with only three seriously used for urban transport. Why is Metro Vancouver now the only region in the world that continues to build with SkyTrain?” asks Malcolm Johnson of the group Rail for the Valley.

Given SNC-Lavalin’s proprietary rights for SkyTrain technology and its ongoing criminal prosecution for fraud and corruption that could result in a ban from bidding on government projects in Canada, the mayors requested confirmation that other companies beside SNC-Lavalin could competitively provide SkyTrain technology.

SNC-Lavalin is already banned from bidding on Word Bank projects due to corruption, and Bombardier is also being investigated.

There also are the questionable underlying assumptions of growth and ridership projections used to justify a SkyTrain subway.

Simple solutions that could be implemented immediately have been avoided to reinforce the narrative that a subway on Broadway is the only option to serve ridership to UBC and that the system is already at capacity. Commuters have been held hostage for over a decade to justify this scheme.

Alternate routes such as along Fourth Ave. have been under-served while increased commuters from the opening of the Evergreen Line have been dumped on Broadway rather than diverted to other less-congested routes with express or expanded B-Line buses.

Also, the mode comparative costs have been biased to SkyTrain. UBC Professor Patrick Condon has shown how LRT tram systems throughout Europe and North America are built for under $50 million per kilometre, while the evaluation report vastly inflates costs to $282 million per kilometre.

The $4-billion SkyTrain subway 7.1-kilometre extension from Arbutus to UBC would be about $563 million per kilometre. Both LRT and subway estimates include a 30- to 50-per-cent contingency, even though the subway has much more risk of unknowns with underground streams and utilities to divert.

The whole 13-kilometre SkyTrain subway from VCC to UBC would be at least $7 billion. If LRT was used, the whole route could be continuously built without a transfer point for much less than the $2.8 billion already committed for the phase to Arbutus. However, that option is not part of the updated report.

If they proceed with the subway, it will be enormously disruptive and damaging to local businesses all along the route for years. Many business owners are already panicking, knowing that even with a bored tunnel there will be cut and cover at every station and for utilities. And it is still a possibility of a bait and switch like SNC-Lavalin did for Canada Line when approvals were for boring while the resulting contract was for cut and cover. There is a lot of money at stake.

Of course, the biggest money is in the development along the line. Development is really what this is all about.

But this anticipated development is not needed to meet growth and will mostly serve the global capital that will further undermine affordability. The subway extension from Arbutus to UBC is predicated on using development fees to help fund it. This will require large amounts of density bonusing for luxury condos at UBC, Jericho Lands, station areas and other sites, on top of rental development that is exempt from development fees.

So rather than development fees going to pay for civic amenities like replacement of community centre facilities at Jericho Hill, it will be going to pay for the provincial, federal and TransLink responsibilities of transit funding. This is an encroachment onto the municipal tax base. Already, TransLink is getting a regional property tax and development fee to pay for the subway’s first phase to Arbutus.

In October 2016, Green Vancouver Coun. Adriane Carr brought forward a motion, seconded by NPA Coun. Melissa De Genova, that opposed the use of development fees to fund transit. It was voted down by Vision. But now both incumbents and their parties (except for Coun. Colleen Hardwick) voted for the subway extension that included funding from development fees.

Vancouver city staff have confirmed that the number of projected new units is beyond that justified for projected population growth. And existing zoned capacity is already well beyond what is needed to meet projected growth to 2040. Yet the rush to rezone continues.

These policies go back to the failed EcoDensity policies of 2007. Former NPA mayor Sam Sullivan copyrighted the name and his then-director of planning, Brent Toderian, defined the program. After the 2008 election, when Sullivan and the NPA were wiped off council except for one seat, he said that he was a victim of density. But Vision, which promised to reconsider EcoDensity, just rebranded it with Toderian as the Greenest City.

Then Vision also approved the regional change from the Livable Region Strategic Plan to the Regional Growth Strategy. This included regional designation of Frequent Transit Development Areas that Broadway, like Cambie, is destined to become if the subway is implemented.

From 2007, the city was warned that making density and growth a primary objective would lead to massive displacement. Demolition of existing affordable rentals, character/heritage houses, secondary suites, and small businesses, would be replaced with much more expensive new construction. And that has come to pass with an affordability crisis as predicted, that will be expanded with the Broadway subway, BS-Line, corridor planning currently underway.

Sullivan now is a provincial MLA as the B.C. Liberal critic for municipal affairs. He is proposing to take away municipal land-use authority on areas around transit to further expedite this tower development agenda. The B.C. budget makes reference to expediting delivery of development project approvals, so the NDP may be looking at encroaching on municipal land-use authority too.

All this just goes to show that bad ideas are not necessarily left or right politically and can continue through various regimes. Although Vision was wiped off council in the last election, without different directions to staff from the new council, we will continue to have more of the same. But the Broadway subway is not a done deal yet and this can be turned around like the freeways and urban renewal schemes of the 1960s.

369,Empty,2019-02-22T15:00:07Z,It will go to a $14-million campaign for relocating Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children.,"ANOTHER RECORD: First-time co-chairs Carman Chan, Isabel Hsieh and Pao Yao Koo hit a home run when the Chinese community’s 24th annual For Children We Care gala reportedly raised a record $4.1 million. That will go toward a $14-million campaign for relocating the development-and-rehabilitation Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children to the B.C. Children’s Hospital’s main campus.

Last year’s event brought in close to $$3.4 million, which exceeded 2017’s by $836,000. Contrasting the hospital’s fiscal prudence, the gala’s theme was Versailles, the extravagant palace and estate that helped bankrupt 18th-century France and send King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette to the guillotine. Conductor Ken Hsieh and the Metropolitan Orchestra entertained gala-goers with music from Parisian Jacques Offenbach’s 1858 Orpheus In The Underworld that also enlivens the cancan dance. Happily, the gala’s fundraising co-chairs proved that they could-could and did-did.

FOR PAINT JOBS WE CARE: Open Road auto dealer Christian Chia showed a $500,000-range Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV at the For Children We Care gala. Viewers included the event’s third-time presenter, Peterson development firm executive chair-CEO Ben Yeung. Few buyers of the off-road-capable Cullinan would likely subject its flawless, porcelain-like surface to damage along bush-and-rock-flanked trails. Ditto when parking by night in certain DTES zones, including one where developer-to-be Yeung located his fresh-from-varsity dental practice.

STARRED: Local self-made billionaire Jim Pattison and entertainers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have received Hometown Stars from the Canada Walk of Fame organization. The local ceremony followed a flossier one in Toronto where Paul Anka and investments supremo Warren Buffett serenaded Pattison with Frank Sinatra’s My Way. Rogan and Goldberg were lauded here by fellow walk-of-famer Howie Mandel. Also by teacher Mike Keenlyside from Point Grey Secondary where their stars will be embedded. Of their alma mater, “Everybody needs to know that Seth was a dropout and didn’t graduate,” Goldberg cracked.

When John Oliver Secondary grad and legendary toiler Pattison was asked if he really ought to be at work during daylight, he replied: “The answer is: Yes.” As for working for Pattison as former NDP premier Glen Clark does, successor John Horgan said: “I’ve got a job right now, but that’s an option.” That option would doubtless pay more than his current $205,400.16 salary. Meanwhile, Horgan and others might heed Pattison’s words: “Do the little things well and the big things will follow.”

BEAR FACTS: Another billionaire hit town recently. That was Seaspan Marine Corp. head Dennis Washington whose US$6-billion-range net worth is close to Pattison’s but whose 332-foot yacht Atessa IV overpowers the latter’s 150-foot Nova Spirit. Washington arrived for the premiere of Great Bear Rainforest, an Imax movie executive-produced by his son and Seaspan ULC executive chair, Kyle. Its director, Ian McAllister, met the younger Washington three years ago at a luncheon for the Pacific Wild Foundation that McAllister co-founded. Rather than conventional digital shooting, three-decade Bella Bella resident McAllister argued for Imax’s costlier 70mm film system that promises worldwide access to young audiences. The picture’s own young characters include Mercedes Robinson, who lives in 350-population Klemtu and retrieves DNA from trees where bears scratch themselves. Of her debut movie role, Robinson said: “You can get a lot of information from bears … who are guardians of the eco-system and have the ability to make it thrive and make the land more healthy.” When grown up, “I hope to provide information to the younger generation so that they protect the (bears’) territory and save it from those taking it from them.”

NEED FOR SPEED: B.C. Women’s Hospital Foundation president-CEO Genesa Greening and board chair Karim Kassam reported $300,000 was raised at the recent Illuminations luncheon. That’s where guests were illuminated regarding thousands of women plagued by slow-to-diagnose health concerns. A tenfold increase in research funding is said to be needed to address complex chronic diseases that are up to nine times likelier to affect women than men.

MEADOW MONEY: Attending the luncheon, the B.C. lieutenant-governor and former Women’s Hospital Foundation board member, Janet Austin, called the hospital’s researchers “some of the best in the world.” Then, pointing to retired Vancouver police inspector Bob Usui, who is one of her 35 ceremonial aides de camp, she told guests: “People think he is the lieutenant-governor, not me.” Her joke likely reminded some of an earlier LG, David Lam, who claimed that children sometimes misheard his title as “left-handed governor.” As for research-funding, Austin sounded in tune with rancher-predecessor Judith Guichon by saying: “Money is like manure — no good if it isn’t spread.”

NEW CARR: Bonhomie, not money, was spread on Great Northern Way recently with Gillian Siddall’s induction as Emily Carr University of Art and Design’s second president and vice-chancellor. She succeeds 22-year incumbent Ron Burnett who oversaw the much-enlarged academy’s move from Granville Island.

FA can be further enzymatically converted in other commercially interesting molecules, such as vanillin and bioplastics. In several organisms, these transformations often start with a common step of FA activation via CoA-thioesterification, catalyzed by feruloyl-CoA synthetases (Fcs). In this context, these enzymes are of biotechnological interest for conversion of lignin-derived FA into high value chemicals. In this study, we describe the first structural characterization of a prokaryotic Fcs, named FCS1, isolated from a lignin-degrading microbial consortium. The FCS1 optimum pH and temperature were 9 and 37°C, respectively, with Km of 0.12 mM and Vmax of 36.82 U/mg. The circular dichroism spectra indicated a notable secondary structure stability at alkaline pH values and high temperatures. This secondary structure stability corroborates the activity data, which remains high until pH 9. The Small Angle X-Ray Scattering analyses resulted on the tertiary/quaternary structure and the low-resolution envelope in solution of FCS1, which was modeled as a homodimer using the hyperthermophilic nucleoside diphosphate-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum. This study contributes to the field of research by establishing the first biophysical and structural characterization for Fcs, and our data may be used for comparison against novel enzymes of this class that to be studied in the future.

Currently, the vast majority of scientific articles related to Fcs concentrate on its application for vanillin production, when combined with the action of an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase [ 29 – 35 ]. In addition to that, there is literature focusing on the description of Fcs transcriptional regulatory mechanism and its role in FA degradation [ 36 – 39 ]. Currently, there is no solved structure of prokaryotic Fcs, as well as, a gap of studies analyzing the biophysical properties of this enzyme. In this study, it is presented a comprehensive biophysical characterization and low-resolution envelope, along with the structural stability and biochemical characteristics, of a Fcs, namely FCS1, which was derived from a lignin degrading consortium.

Physiologically, this class of enzymes is of particular importance in the sensing of aromatic molecules by microorganisms and activation of respective pathways. The product of the reaction catalyzed by Fcs, feruloyl-CoA, binds to a MarR-family transcriptional repressor and effectively abrogates its ligation to the DNA, thus enabling the expression of genes related to the degradation of FA and other related p-hydroxycinnamic acids in several species [ 23 – 27 ]. Recently, the metagenomic profiling of a lignin-degrading consortium, originated from soil of a sugarcane plantation [ 28 ], revealed the major metabolic pathways related to degradation of phenolic compounds, including a number of putative sequences correspondent to Fcs, denoting the catabolism of FA and other p-hydroxycinnamates.

In prokaryotes, FA catabolism occurs via four major pathways: non β-oxidation, β-oxidation, non-oxidative decarboxylation, and side-chain reduction [ 22 ]. The first two pathways employ Fcs as initial step, by catalyzing the CoA-thioesterification of FA in feruloyl-CoA, with ATP consumption. The subsequent reactions direct the intermediates towards ring fission by the central metabolism, usually via vanillin and, posteriorly, through the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway.

Several research groups are currently focusing in strategies for lignin valorization, mainly exploring chemical catalysis and biological degradation approaches. The latter revolves around “mimicking” nature’s strategies for lignin degradation and consequent carbon cycling, mainly through the identification, characterization and improvement of lignin-degrading organisms and their enzymes. Traditionally, white-rot fungi are the best characterized lignin degraders and there is extensive literature on the enzymatic mechanisms of fungal lignin peroxidases [ 9 , 10 ]. Recently, bacterial degraders have also been the focus of research, not only concerning their capability of lignin depolymerization, but also the catabolism of aromatic molecules derived from its breakdown [ 11 – 13 ]. Therefore, there is great opportunity for genetic and metabolic engineering of microbial pathways, aiming the conversion of lignin in value-added products [ 14 – 16 ]. FA is the precursor of subunit guaiacyl in lignin biosynthesis, is near ubiquitous in plant cells walls of various grasses, where it endows structural rigidity and resistance by cross-linking to pentosan, arabinoxylans and hemicelluloses [ 17 ]. As biorefineries adapt to meet the cellulosic ethanol production goals, it is expected that FA, as other cinnamic acid derivatives, will play a major role as resources for bioproducts. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the successful production of vanillin [ 18 – 20 ] and bioplastics [ 21 ] from FA derived from lignin streams and lignocellulosic biomass.

In comparison with first generation biofuels, which utilize sucrose or starch as source of fermentable sugars, the lignocellulosic biomass-reliant second-generation counterparts are considered more cost-effective and less threatening to food security and land usage policies [ 2 ]. Nevertheless, the full implementation of second generation biorefineries is hindered by considerable technological and economical hurdles, including feedstock recovery, biomass pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation optimization and biofuel separation [ 3 , 4 ]. In this context, lignin conversion and valorization has emerged as a possible solution for both cost-effectiveness of second-generation biorefineries and excessive reliance on petroleum-derived chemicals [ 5 – 7 ]. It is predicted that the amount of lignin residue from cellulosic biorefineries solely in the USA will reach as much as 62 million tons per year [ 8 ], denoting the great opportunity of valorizing this stream into high-market compounds.

Lignocellulosic biomass harbors a barely explored mine of fermentable sugars and aromatic polymers as structural components. The cellulose and lignin fractions represent the first and second most abundant sources of organic carbon on Earth, respectively, rendering lignocellulose as an attractive possibility for alternative resource of fuels and chemicals [ 1 ].

The ELS measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern) [ 61 , 62 ]. The measurements were performed using a fixed FCS1 concentration of 13.4 μM (1 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values. FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to ELS measurements.

The Fluorescence emission measurements were performed on a steady-state spectrofluorometer model Cary Eclypse Varian. FCS1 concentration was 5 μM (0.38 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values (pH 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to measurements. The three tryptophan residues of FCS1 were excited at 295 nm (20 o C) and the fluorescence emission was measured from 300 to 450 nm. The buffer contribution was subtracted in each of the experiments. The measurements were made in triplicate and the average values reported.

The CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter. FCS1 concentration was 10 μM (0.75 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values (pH 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to measurements. All spectra were measured using a 1 mm quartz cuvette at 20 o C over the wavelength range from 190 to 270 nm. For each pH value, eight scans (obtained on degree scale, mdeg) were averaged to form the final CD spectrum. Furthermore, CD measurements were collected at pH 7 and different temperature values (20, 60, 70 and 90 o C). The buffer contribution was subtracted in each of the experiments.

The SAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS beamline of National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). SAXS measurements for FCS1 were performed at 1 and 5 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer adjusted at pH 7. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10 min (at 4 o C) and then loaded into a 1 mm path length cell made of two thin parallel mica windows and maintained at 20 o C during the measurements. The wavelength of the X-ray beam was 1.48 Å and the sample-to-detector distance (1 m) was adjusted to record the scattering intensity for q values ranging from 0.013 to 0.340 Å -1 . A total of five successive frames of 60 s were recorded for each sample and buffer scattering was measured before each sample scattering. The X-ray patterns were recorded employing a two-dimensional CCD detector (MarResearch, USA) and the integration were performed by the FIT2D software [ 56 ]. The scattering of water measured on the same sample cell was used to normalize the data to absolute scale. The distance distribution function was evaluated using the GNOM software [ 57 ]. At least eight dummy atom models (DAMs) were calculated using the DAMMIN software [ 58 ] without imposing any symmetry restrictions, and the resulting models were compared with each other using the DAMAVER software [ 59 ]. The CRYSOL software [ 60 ] was used to generate theoretical scattering curves from the three-dimensional structures. The atomic coordinates of the low-resolution model of FCS1 are available from the corresponding author upon request.

The hydrodynamic radius (R H ) of the FCS1 was determined by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). This system employs a fixed scattering angle of 173 o . DLS measurements for FCS1 were performed at 1 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer adjusted at pH 7. The hydrodynamic radius was converted to molecular mass (kDa) considering a spherical molecule and using the Zetasizer software.

The servers for remote protein homology detection HHPRED [ 49 ] and PHYRE2 [ 50 ] were used to search for homologs for FCS1 in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 51 ]. Molecular model for FCS1 was built using homology-modeling methods and the MODELLER software [ 52 ]. The alignment of the amino acids sequence of FCS1 against the amino acids sequence of NDP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum (ckcACD) [ 53 ] was used as input to the MODELLER software, together with the atomic coordinates of the latter (PDB 4XYL, dimeric structure) used as template. The homology model was modeled as a dimer. The template (PDB 4XYL) has 4 chains (A, B, C and D). The chains A and B served as templates for the chain A of our model (monomer), while the chains C and D served as templates for the chain B of our model. Sequences were aligned with Protein BLAST [ 54 ]. Conservation analysis was conducted with T-Coffee [ 55 ] software using 1.002 sequences with E-value < 1e-100.

For thermostability determination, purified FCS1 in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was incubated at room temperature, 25, 37, 45, 70 and 85°C for 15, 30 and 60 min. For evaluation of enzyme stability in different pHs, 400 ng of purified FCS1 was incubated for 1, 5 and 24 h in 20 mM ABF buffer, pH 7.0–10.0, at 4 ºC. Residual activity was assayed as described in the enzymatic assay topic (incubation at 37°C for 10 min) and immediately read at 345 nm.

The enzymatic activity in a range of pHs was assayed in either 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pHs 5.8–8.0) or 20 mM (acetate-borate-phosphate) buffer (pHs 7.4–9.4). After stopping FCS1 reaction by heat inactivation (70°C for 15 min), the was pH neutralized to 7.8 by adding a highly ionic strength buffer (phosphate buffer at 2 M). Then, the volume of 150 μL of each reaction were collected and absorbance at 345 nm was read immediately. As controls, reactions without added enzyme were used for each temperature and pH value evaluated. All reactions and controls were made in triplicate and the average values reported. All initial assays were conducted with an additional control containing FA and heat-inactivated enzyme.

The temperature range from 15°C to 90°C was chosen for determination of FCS1 optimal temperature. A total volume of 200 μL reactions (as described above) were incubated at the temperature range in a T100 thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 5 min, using the assay do conditions described above.

For determination of kinetic parameters of FCS1, the above reaction was assayed with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM to 0.50 mM. Mathematical adjustments were made using the software Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software) to calculate the parameters. The assays were performed in triplicate and at least three independent experiments were carried out.

The enzymatic assays were adapted from previously described methods [ 47 , 48 ], the schematic reaction was included in S1 Fig . The reaction mixture (200 μL) contained 2.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM of FA, 2.0 mM of ATP, 0.4 mM of coenzyme A, 40 ng of purified FCS1 and 100 mM of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8. The activity assay was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Following incubation, 150 μL of the reaction were used to read the absorbance at 345 nm due to formation of feruloyl-CoA (ε 345nm = 1.9 x 10 4 M -1 cm -1 ), using an Epoch2 Microplate Reader spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) containing 0.3 mg/mL of lysozyme, 1 mM of DNase and 5 mM of phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, under agitation, the cells were disrupted in ice bath by an ultrasonic processor (10 pulses of 30 s at 30% duty cycle; Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 Series, Cole-Palmer Instruments). The soluble protein fractions were obtained by centrifugation for 1 h and 30 min at 8,000 rpm, 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was filtered once in 0.45 μm and twice in 0.22 μm filters. The final solution containing the protein of interest was purified by affinity chromatography in AKTA Start system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) using a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with Co 2+ and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Elution of FCS1 was achieved using a 0–100% linear gradient of buffer B (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). Afterwards, the eluted protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/600 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl). Buffer Exchange and protein concentration were performed using Amicon device (Merck, USA). The concentration of purified FCS1 was measured by DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer (ε 280nm = 43,570 M -1 cm -1 ) (Uniscience, USA) and by Bradford quantification [ 46 ]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using a 12.5% gel in a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra System electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 for 3 h and distained in distilled water overnight.

The cells from a single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing the construction pET28a-FCS1 were grown in liquid LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) for 16 h at 37°C and 200 rpm. 8 mL of the overnight culture were used to inoculate 800 mL of fresh LB-kanamycin medium, followed by incubation at 37°C and 200 rpm until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm reached a value of 0.6–0.8. To induce recombinant protein expression, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, followed by incubation at 30°C, 200 rpm for 4 h. After expression, the culture media was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 15 min and the cell pellet was kept at -20°C.

FCS1 sequence (GenBank accession: MG214406) was retrieved, codon-optimized, synthetized and cloned as previously described [ 28 ]. This previous work also showed the enzyme applicability for bioproduction of vanillin, together with an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase. The domain architecture of the enzyme, named FCS1, was further evaluated using the Pfam and SMART databases [ 40 – 42 ]. Calculation of biochemical and biophysical parameters for the putative protein sequence were performed via Protparam [ 43 ] online tool. The annotation of orthologous groups was done by comparison against the EggNOG 4.5.1 database [ 44 ]. The phylogenetic tree was built with MEGA 7 [ 45 ].

Premier Brian Pallister and Health Minister Cameron Friesen unveiled plans for a 143-bed care home set to be built in the rapidly growing city of about 16,000, about 50 kilometres southeast of Winnipeg.

A Manitoba Health spokesperson said the hope is to get shovels in the ground by this fall and for the project to be completed within 24 to 36 months.

The province didn't provide a project cost estimate, but said it will provide capital funding and HavenGroup, which operates seniors' residences in Steinbach, is paying the rest.

The new care home will be built next to HavenGroup's Rest Haven personal care home, which has 60 beds, and the 86-suite seniors' housing complex of Woodhaven Manor.

""We're working hard as a government to ensure that all Manitobans get better health care and get it sooner, and in the case of personal care home services this is especially important,"" Pallister said at a Thursday news conference at Rest Haven.

""I speak as a son and grandson who had the joy and satisfaction and peace of mind of knowing that my mother and grandmother were able to get the kind of care they deserved,"" he said.

""I know how important it is for families to make sure that we give each other that support, and that care in their lives and in ours.""

'Terrible burden'

The new facility will be built in clusters of about a dozen rooms with private washrooms and shared dining, activity and multi-purpose spaces, the province said. Storage, offices, patios, and maintenance and laundry services will also be included.

The building will add capacity to Manitoba's system, which currently has 10,000 people living in 125 licensed care homes, Pallister said. It also gets the province closer to its commitment to add 1,200 personal care home beds by 2025, said Friesen.

The decision to build in Steinbach followed a 2016 review by the Southern Health-Santé Sud health authority that found there was a demand for more beds locally.

Friesen said families incur a ""terrible burden"" when a loved one is approved to go into a care home but is told there's nowhere for them to live near home.

""Too many of you have your own anecdotes of what happens when we do not have capacity to deliver personal care"" spaces, Friesen told people at the news conference.

""We have seen these stories, we have lived these stories along with our constituents, and today what we're talking about is capacity in growing areas because our seniors need it. They deserve it.""

'Recycled announcement': NDP

Manitoba NDP Leader Wab Kinew and Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont both characterized the announcement as scant on new details and a rehash of an old commitment.

Then-health minister Kelvin Goertzen previously revealed preliminary plans for Steinbach, along with plans for new personal care home spaces in Winnipeg and Carman, in September 2017.

""Given that this project was already announced on September 8, 2017, it was hardly worth the premier's trip to Steinbach,"" Lamont said in a statement, riffing on city's famous ""it's worth the trip"" slogan.

Kinew echoed those words, adding Pallister's government isn't any closer to hitting its campaign promise of adding 1,200 beds.

""Today's recycled announcement provides no new money for this project,"" Kinew said.

""Meanwhile, emergency rooms in Winnipeg and rural Manitoba are forced to turn away patients because of Pallister's cuts. His plan to cut services and close facilities is hurting Manitoba families.""

'Better value for money' than under NDP

Lamont wondered why project costs weren't announced Thursday.

""We would like to know why it has taken so long for this project to be put out to tender and why cost suddenly seems to be a secret,"" he said.

""The last time this was promised, the PCs said over and over again that it would only cost $133,000 per bed, which we have been told is a totally unrealistic, low-ball price.""

Lamont said if those estimates have changed, Manitobans deserve to know.

A Manitoba Health spokesperson said project costs are being withheld so as not to affect the tendering process.

""However, we anticipate this project will provide far better value for money for taxpayers than the NDP was able to achieve on [personal care homes] while offering a more contemporary design that better meets the needs of residents,"" the spokesperson said in an email.","Province unveils plans for 143-bed Steinbach care home, but withholds cost estimate",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-steinbach-care-home-beds-1.5028695
372,Empty,2019-02-25T19:41:20Z,"Government has included renewables in the country's energy mix as part of plans to mitigate the impact of climate change, says energy Minister Jeff Radebe.","Although there have been calls for the scrapping of independent power producers from some quarters, including trade union the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and opposition party the Economic Freedom Fighters, government is determined IPPs are here to stay to ensure security of electricity supply.

Among other objections, the announcement of the unbundling of Eskom stirred fears job losses in the coal sector, particularly through the introduction of renewable IPPs in the generation space.

In response, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe on Sunday held a briefing to clarify government's rationale for including renewables in the country's energy mix.

Here are the five reasons outlined by Radebe:

1. Climate change

SA committed itself to the Paris Agreement to mitigate the effects of climate change. This means SA must make a contribution to a global effort in reducing carbon emissions and other ""climate resilient"" developments, Radebe said.

""The basic rationale behind renewable energy is therefore arresting the high negative impact of fossil fuel sources of energy such as oil and coal.""

Renewable IPPs so far have reduced carbon emissions by 33.2 million tonnes, in addition to carbon dioxide and water savings of 39.2 million kilolitres by December 31, 2018, the minister added.

2. Energy policy

The decision to include renewables in the electricity system dates back to a 1998 White Paper on Energy Policy. In November 2003, the ANC-led government adopted the White Paper on Renewable Energy. It sets a target for 10 000 GW hours to be achieved by 2013. At the time, Eskom's generation was 90% dependent on coal and government had made a decision to move away from solely being reliant on fossil fuels, Radebe explained.

The Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) 2010, promulgated on May 6, 2011, indicated that by 2030, 17 800 MW of new capacity would be provided by renewable energy.

Furthermore, a Green Economy Accord was negotiated by social partners and government and signed on November 17, 2011 – which makes commitments to developing a ""greener economy"". Among other things, it sets a target of 3 725 MW to be generated from renewable energy by 2016.

Vision 2030 under the National Development Plan (NDP) also calls for SA to invest in skills, technology and institutional capacity to support a competitive renewable energy sector to leverage its solar resource. The NDP, adopted in 2012, states SA needs at least 20 000 MW of renewable energy by 2030.

3. Lack of investment in coal projects

Locally commercial banks such as Standard bank and Nedbank are ""no more willing"" to support coal-fired power projects, Radebe said.

Internationally, countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are also against funding coal projects due to climate concerns.

The World Bank and other international development finance institutions and commercial banks have instituted a no-coal policy.

China, India and the US and others are also down-scaling coal-fired fleets.

4. Renewable energy is becoming cheaper

Radebe said that initially, renewable energy programmes were ""relatively higher in pricing"", but costs have since declined. ""Steep falls [have been] recorded from wind and solar PV technologies,"" he said.

Radebe listed an example of how wind technology was first priced at 151 c/kWh in November 2011, but has since fallen to 62 c/kWh by 2016.

5. Positive impact on the economy

Radebe highlighted the benefits of renewable energy to the economy, which includes attracting investment commitments of R209.4bn from the private sector.

Renewable IPPs have also created 38 701 job years, meaning full-time jobs have been created for 38 701 people for one year. Local communities have also benefited from over R1bn spent by IPPs on education initiatives, among other socio-economic upliftment projects.",Fin24.com | 5 reasons renewables are here to stay,Fin24.com,https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/5-reasons-renewables-are-here-to-stay-20190225-2

The Local Planning Appeal Support Centre was created just last year as part of the Wynne government's reforms to the former Ontario Municipal Board (OMB), a body long criticized for favouring developers in its decisions about zoning.

The centre provides information to citizens on the complicated land-use planning process, guiding neighbourhood groups through public meetings. It also offers free legal help with appeals of municipal zoning decisions, now heard at the Local Planning Appeals Tribunal, the quasi-judicial body that replaced the OMB.

The centre's closure is prompting critics to accuse the Progressive Conservatives of pro-developer bias. The move was not publicly announced by the government, but was revealed in a short note posted on the agency's website.

""The Government of Ontario has made a decision to close the Local Planning Appeal Support Centre (LPASC). LPASC has until June 30, 2019 to wind down the business,"" says the posting,

""Effective immediately, LPASC will no longer be accepting new requests for professional services from the public. During this wind down period, LPASC is committed to continuing to serve, to the best of its ability, those clients who have retained its services.""

Attorney General Caroline Mulroney, whose ministry oversees the centre, declined a request for an interview Friday. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)

The agency began last April with 10 staff and a budget of $1.6 million for 2018-19, according to provincial government figures.

Attorney General Caroline Mulroney, whose ministry oversees the centre, declined a request for an interview Friday.

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the ministry of the attorney general said the government has to make ""difficult decisions"" about programs and demand for the centre's services has been low, averaging just three enquiries per day.

""Recent reforms to the land use planning and appeal system give greater weight to the decisions of local communities, while balancing development and growth in Ontario,"" said the statement. ""Over time this will result in fewer appeals at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. and an appeal process that is more efficient and affordable for everyone.""

Mulroney did not respond to questions from CBC about the fate of the staff, and how shutting the centre squares with Ford's promise that no public sector workers will lose their jobs.

'The land-use planning process is very complicated and is very difficult to work through,' says Anna Pace, chair of the support centre about to be closed by the Ford government. (Taylor Simmons/CBC)

The New Democrats say the move amounts to ""stacking the deck"" against ordinary people in favour of powerful developers.

""Doug Ford is once again doing favours for his friends,"" said NDP municipal affairs critic Jeff Burch in a statement. He said the centre ""gave local communities a fighting chance when facing off against wealthy developers.""

""It really looks like a confirmation of the alliance between Doug Ford and the developers,"" said Liberal MPP Nathalie Des Rosiers in an interview Friday.

""This support centre was specifically designed to help citizens groups meaningfully participate in planning appeals that traditionally have been dominated by well-heeled developers,"" Des Rosiers said.

Former minister of municipal affairs Ted McMeekin tweeted that the move is ""going backwards.""

Hard to believe! Building strong, healthy and complete communities is predicated on good Official Planning. And that planning only works when citizens can meaningfully engage and receive support for that engagement. This is going backwards folk.

The chair of the centre's board of directors, Anna Pace, said she is disappointed by the decision.

""The land-use planning process is very complicated and is very difficult to work through,"" said Pace in an interview Friday.

""Big developers can afford to hire the resources that they need,"" she said. ""It's important for people to have advice and support.""

Pace said the centre made ""a lot of progress"" in its first year of existence. ""We had very good staff,"" she said.

Plecas released a 32-page report Thursday that calls into question many of the defences provided by clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz in response to allegations of “flagrant overspending,” lavish trips overseas, large retirement payouts and cash payments in lieu of vacation time.

Lenz and James have said the expenses were work-related and important to the functioning of the legislature, adding that many of them were approved by Plecas himself. They have said they have done nothing wrong, and have questioned the accuracy and truthfulness of Plecas’s accusations.

In his latest report, Plecas alleges that James organized an earthquake preparedness conference in Washington state in August 2017 which amounted to no more than a $1,024 whale-watching trip for eight people and $1,073 worth of tickets to a Seattle Mariners baseball game.

The official-sounding agenda for the Washington trip was misleading, Plecas alleges. He says a whale-watching trip was listed as “Tsunami Watch: Guided tours of Haro Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait with explanations of aquatic life and seismic activity” and a baseball game at Safeco Field was described as “Safe passages: Large-Scale Evacuations.” Lenz and James’s spouses were also on the trip.

Three “working dinners” cost taxpayers $3,601, Plecas writes, although Lenz reimbursed the legislature $93 for his wife’s meals.

Plecas notes there was no prearranged conference in Washington state that required travel there; rather the trip was arranged by James.

“What in fact appears to be the case is that their extensive ‘work’ travels served as their de facto holidays,” Plecas writes. “If this weren’t so serious, it would be the stuff of comedy.”

James and Lenz have been suspended since Nov. 20, when they were escorted out of the legislature by police.

The legislative assembly management committee, a panel of MLAs that oversees the running the legislature, agreed Thursday to appoint a retired Supreme Court justice to report on whether Lenz and James engaged in misconduct. The independent report will not interfere with an ongoing RCMP investigation, said NDP house leader Mike Farnworth.

The retired judge could make recommendations on whether the two senior legislative officers should remain suspended with pay. James was paid a salary of $347,090 in 2018 and Lenz was paid $218,167.

Plecas said he will recuse himself from any matters relating to the independent report, including creating the terms of reference and selecting the retired judge.

The Speaker told reporters after the committee meeting that he made the recommendation to recuse himself because “we’ve reached a place in all of this where so much of the information was presented by myself. I think most people would say that at some point I should step back and say it should be someone other than me who is making comment.”

The retired judge’s review will run parallel to auditor general Carol Bellringer’s forensic audit of the legislature’s finances and a workplace review that will look into allegations that legislative staff members were fired after raising concerns about questionable expenses.

In his latest report, Plecas writes that “the house leaders need to decide whether confidence in these two officers has been undermined to the point that, regardless of the outcome of the further processes, audits and investigations, Mr. James and Mr. Lenz cannot realistically return to their positions as the senior executives of the legislative assembly.”

Plecas raises concerns about the lack of oversight and accountability for the clerk and the sergeant-at-arms: “Why are these officers travelling all over the world like dignitaries, spending enormous amounts of money and justifying it all by their bare assurances that the events were useful?”

He writes that while he agreed with James and Lenz that it’s important to develop relationships and compare best practices with other parliamentary officials, the two seemed to be meeting with the same people about the same topics in different locations around the world.

For example, a December 2017 trip to Scotland was arranged to meet with an expert in “business continuity” at the Scottish Parliament, but that same official was in B.C. and attended the Washington trip four months earlier, Plecas writes.

James’s response says that the Speaker approved the itineraries for several overseas trips, including two trips to London, and never flagged any issues with expenses.

In his report, Plecas explains why he signed off on some of the expenses.

“That is because I trusted Mr. James when he told me that something had been long in the works, had already been approved, was an inconsequential administrative matter, or was something he and all employees were entitled to,” he writes. “Senior executives depend on forthright advice from senior managers about matters put forward for approval — it is not a game of ‘catch me if you can.’ ”

James is also accused of loading his pickup truck with $10,000 worth of alcohol and driving it to the Penticton home of former Speaker Bill Barisoff. In his rebuttal, James says he took some alcohol, along with a desk and chair, to Barisoff’s home but “categorically” denies that the liquor was worth $10,000. James says Barisoff wrote a cheque to the legislative assembly for the alcohol.

Plecas’s latest report says Barisoff wrote a cheque, dated June 26, 2013, for $370 with a memo reading “wine purchase.”

Plecas says that amount does not match up with employees’ accounts that two truckloads worth of alcohol, including beer, boxes of wine and hard liquor, were loaded into the truck. James took two work days to make the trip to Penticton and expensed taxpayers for a hotel and travel expenses, which far exceeded the $370 cheque, Plecas says.

James’s lawyer, Mark Andrews, who was also authorized to speak on behalf of Lenz, appeared Thursday before the all-party legislative assembly management committee. Andrews argued that Lenz and James should have the opportunity to review the Speaker’s followup report before it was released publicly.

That was rejected by the committee.","Taxpayer-funded work trips were ‘de facto holidays’ for B.C. Legislature clerk, speaker",Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/22/taxpayer-funded-work-trips-holidays-bc-legislature-clerk-speaker/

Abstrac…","Monitoring of the FITC labeled {Eu(SiW 11 O 39 ) 2 }–CMC within HeLa cells showed that the nanoparticles were preferably located in the perinuclear region in close proximity to the nuclei. 98 Clathrin‐mediated endocytosis was proposed as POM‐free chitosan nanoparticles are internalized by this pathway; however, this was later excluded as the cellular uptake of POM‐CT was not inhibited by the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine indicating a clathrin‐independent pathway. 99 Thus, macropinocytosis and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis were suggested as internalization pathways for, at least, POM‐CT hybrids as chitosan‐DNA‐poly(γ‐glutamic acid) complexes are uptaken by these pathways. 125

Nevertheless, it is still generally assumed that POMs are mainly taken up by cells by some form of endocytosis. Different POTs were traced within murine macrophage J774 cells revealing POM containing vacuoles within the cells, wherefore, it was suggested that POMs might bind to scavenger receptors and enter the cell by scavenger receptor‐mediated endocytosis. 124 Similarly, huge POMo nanoparticles such as (NH 4 ) 42 [{(Mo VI )Mo 5 VI O 21 (H 2 O) 6 } 12 {Mo 2 V O 4 (CH 3 COO) 30 }] were found to be located within endosomes that were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of Hep‐G2 cells, supporting internalization by an endocytotic pathway. 119

The antiproliferative activity of an anticancer drug is directly associated with its degree of cellular uptake. It is well accepted that POMs are able to penetrate cancer cells, as many studies have experimentally confirmed their location within the cytoplasmic space. 46 , 99 , 109 - 111 , 119 However, no convincing data has been reported revealing the exact mechanism. Owing to their large size and negative charge, POMs are supposed to be rather unable to penetrate the largely negatively charged cell membranes of mammalian cells. POMs such as the Keggin‐type were characterized as super chaotropic agents with a surprisingly high tendency to adsorb on neutral and hydrophilic surfaces, whereby POMs with lower charge densities were more chaotropic. 120 Owing to this feature, POMs exhibited destructive activity towards model cell membranes by adsorbing to the vesicle surface, followed by the formation of a stable POM–lipid conjugate, which finally desorbs from the membrane (Figure 10 ). 121 , 122 These desorption processes led to leaky membrane structures. Studies with anionic lipids revealed that depending on the charge density, the POM–lipid interactions can switch from electrostatic to hydrophobic nature, owing to the charge neutralization by cationic counterions. 123

3.2 Proposed Modes of Action and Biological Targets of Antitumoral Polyoxometalates

Figure 11 shows most of the putative mechanisms of antitumoral POMs in a comprehensive Scheme. The first suggested mechanism for the antitumor activity of POMs was that by Yamase, which was already mentioned in the introduction.19 Briefly, repeated reduction/oxidation cycles between the POM and cell components, most likely members of the electron transport chain, are supposed to interfere with ATP generation, which finally leads to apoptosis (Figure 11 a). The theory is widely accepted, as a series of studies revealed a putative correlation between the cytotoxicity and the redox potential of bioactive POMs.38-44 This correlation is a weak one and only applies to very closely related structures, as other factors like size, structure, and composition play also a significant role. In general, there is no unambiguous correlation between the anticancer activity of POMs and parameters such as POM size, total net charge, charge density, oxidation power, and archetype.

Figure 11 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Illustration of most of the proposed modes of action of antitumoral POMs. a) POM induced inhibition of ATP synthesis by interfering with the electron transfer chain (represented as dark blue entities, the inset shows a zoomed view of the chain). b) POM induced increase in ROS‐level (for example by oxidizing cell components) and depletion of the GSH pool (by GSH oxidation). c) POM induced enhancement of the expression of pro‐apoptotic components (Bax and Bim) and the reduction of the expression of anti‐apoptotic components (bcl‐2 and NF‐κB). d),e) Activation of the p53 and/or p38 pathway by POMs. Please note: the circles reading p38 and p53 do not represent the respective protein but the pathways. f) Induction of apoptosis by direct DNA damage. g),h) POM‐mediated inhibition of angiogenesis via interaction with bFGF and VEGF leading to the disruption of the VEGF/bFGF‐receptor interactions (receptors are indicated as yellow and brownish channels). Without VEGF/bFGF‐receptor binding, the ERK pathway cannot be activated leading to the breakdown of angiogenesis. i) Inhibition of ectonucleotidases by POMs leads to a distortion in the concentrations of nucleotides (NTP, NDP, and NMP) and nucleosides (Ns), which negatively affects the functioning of cancer cells. j) Inhibition of HDAC by POMs leads to the accumulation of acetylated histones, causing fatal changes in the expression of genes. k) Inhibition of P‐type ATPases has fatal effects on the cellular ion homeostasis. l) Decavanadate‐induced mitochondria membrane depolarization. m) Inhibition of other proteins that affect cell viability (for more details, see text of Section 2.3.1 and 3.2.5, and references therein). n) POM hybrids loaded with siRNA (siRNA is depicted as red RNA structure) downregulate HIF‐1, leading to the impairment of angiogenesis and the adaptation of cancer cells to the hypoxic environment. o) Immunostimulating activity of POMs by promoting the expression of antibodies and immune‐related components (for example, NK cells). The figure depicts the activation of NK cells via antibody binding enhancing the recognition of tumor cells (antigens are depicted as purple triangles) by NK cells. Dotted lines indicate that the reason of activation/deactivation (for example, enhanced/decreased expression) of certain components is not known. The release of cytochrome c (purple circle) triggers the apoptotic machinery of the cell, which ultimately activate the final executers of apoptosis (caspases).

3.2.1 Activation of Cell Death Pathways Apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy are types of cell death, which are generally highly sophisticated processes including complex signaling cascades that are tightly regulated. According to Section 2, a number of POMs induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway as no study describes, for example, the involvement of a death receptor, which is a hallmark for extrinsic apoptosis. The reason for this is that most POMs mainly induced “internal damage” by oxidative stress, which is signaled to mitochondria (Figure 12 b). Some POMs like the Wells–Dawson POM are able to induce apoptosis by affecting the expression of cell death regulators, for example, by increasing the amount of the pro‐apoptotic proteins Bax and Bim (Figure 12 c).126, 127 Other POMs, such as Krebs‐type, do also reduce the expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein bcl‐2 and the transcriptional factor NF‐κB (Figure 12 c).33, 34 Active NF‐κB is responsible for the expression of genes that protect the cell from undergoing apoptosis, however, many tumor types have a constantly active NF‐κB and therefore its inhibition represents a promising approach in cancer therapy. Furthermore, Krebs‐type tungstobismuthates are able to increase the expression of p53 activating apoptosis partially by this pathway (Figure 12 d).33 The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that induces anti‐carcinogenesis events such as cell growth arrest and inhibition of angiogenesis, making it the guardian of the genome and one of the most promising targets as about 50 % of human cancers are thought to be related to p53 mutations.128 Some POMs like the CoII containing Krebs‐type (H 2 im) 2 [(W(OH) 2 ) 2 (Co(H 2 O) 3 ) 2 (Na 4 (H 2 O) 14 )(BiW 9 O 33 ) 2 ] are able to enhance the activation of caspase‐3, the final executioner of apoptosis.35, 127 Na 7 [CrIIICuIIW 11 O 39 ] was observed to induce the upregulation of both cytochrome c and activated p38 in human ovarian SK‐OV‐3 cancer cells (Figure 12 e), despite its very low anticancer activity (IC 50 =1.87 mm).127 Cytochrome c is an essential component of the electron transport chain but plays also a decisive role in apoptosis as its release from the mitochondria into the cytosol upon apoptotic stimuli triggers apoptosis.129 Thus, POM‐induced overexpression of cytochrome c can promote cell death. p38 is a mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) that has oncogenesis suppressing properties as it is required for dormancy, that is, inhibition of the cell proliferation upon certain stress stimuli.130 Furthermore, Na 7 [CrIIICuIIW 11 O 39 ] is also able to trigger autophagy, which means that two cell death pathways can run in parallel. The same was observed for PM‐17 as it induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death in vitro and in vivo.18 The sandwich POM [H 4 {CuII 9 AsIII 6 O 15 (H 2 O) 6 }(AsIIIW 9 O 33 ) 2 ]8− exhibited remarkable activity against cancerous K‐562 (leukemia) and Hep‐G2 (liver) cells (IC 50 =0.4 μm for both) by affecting lysosomes in vitro, which led to the induction of both apoptosis and autophagy.131 The autophagy inducing property might originate from the AsIII containing unit as As 2 O 3 is known to induce autophagy in leukemia cells by increasing the level of Beclin‐1, a critical regulator of autophagy.132

3.2.2 DNA Interaction One of the main stimuli inducing intrinsic apoptosis is DNA damage. Therefore, the anticancer activity of a series of POMs and POM‐based hybrids was associated with DNA lesions but mainly induced indirectly as the negative charge of both molecules is supposed to prevent direct electrostatic interactions. However, some POM‐based structures were found to directly interact with DNA (Figure 12 f), for example, [(CpTi) 3 SiW 9 O 37 ]7− interacts strongly with DNA, most likely via its CpTi moiety.43, 47 These results were confirmed by the group of Habibi, which investigated the behavior of different CpM‐substituted Keggin POTs (M=ZrIV, TiIV, FeII) towards ctDNA and suggested a direct but noncovalent groove or outside stacking binding mode for the POM.46 Later, the number of POMs directly interacting with ctDNA was extended, including [PV 2 Mo 10 O 40 ]5− and [V 18 O 42 (H 2 O)]12−.31, 109-111 Despite the suggested groove or outside stacking interaction, the exact POM binding mechanism remains elusive. Another study investigating the interaction between heptamolybdate [Mo 7 O 24 ]6− and the DNA model bis(p‐nitrophenyl)phosphate showed that the POM was able to cleave the phosphodiester bond by a yet unknown mechanism.133

3.2.3 Inhibition of Angiogenesis Angiogenesis describes the formation of new blood vessels, a vital process in cell growth.134 As cancer cells are rapidly dividing, tumors need special blood supply to provide oxygen and other nutrients to continue their abnormal growth. Thus, they induce angiogenesis by activating various growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which stimulate the formation of blood vessels. The inhibition of angiogenesis promoting factors is a potential approach in cancer therapy. A series of POMs, including lacunary and fully saturated Keggin, sandwich Keggin, and Wells–Dawson structures, interact strongly with bFGF leading to the inhibition of its proliferation promoting activity in HUVECs.135, 136 Independent of the charge, Wells–Dawson POMs were most efficient in binding bFGF and therefore it was assumed that the POM structure determines the affinity towards bFGF. Competition assays with suramin, which is known for its angiosuppressive properties, and heparin, an activity enhancer and inhibitor of bFGF, revealed that POMs bind in the vicinity of the heparin binding site, which is rich in positively charged amino acids. According to the dimensions of the proposed binding site, Wells–Dawson structures are supposed to fit better into it than the smaller Keggin ions, which might explain the differences in binding affinity (Figure 12). POM binding might interfere with the ability of bFGF to interact with its receptors, which is required for its angiogenesis promoting function (Figure 12 g). Figure 12 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Putative POM‐binding site of bFGF. a) Crystal structure of human bFGF (PDB entry 1BFF137) with the putative binding site being marked by a red circle. Side chains of amino acids that potentially contribute to heparin binding are shown as sticks. b) Coulombic surface representation of bFGF is illustrated with blue surfaces representing regions exhibiting a positive potential, whereas gray and red surfaces possess neutral and negative potentials, respectively. c) Zoom view and dimensions of the putative POM‐binding site. d) Polyhedra structures and dimensions of the Keggin and Wells–Dawson anions for easier comparison. Blue polyhedra are {MO 6 }, green polyhedra {XO 4 }, green sticks carbon, dark blue sticks nitrogen, red sticks and spheres oxygen. Mo‐based giant POMs like (NH 4 ) 42 [{(MoVI)Mo 5 VIO 21 (H 2 O) 6 } 12 {Mo 2 VO 4 (CH 3 COO) 30 }] exhibited astonishing anticancer activities against some cancer cell lines with high selectivity towards Hep‐G2 cells (IC 50 =9–55 μg mL−1) mainly by inhibiting angiogenesis (Supporting Information, Table S1, described as Mo‐compounds 1–3).119 The Mo‐nanoparticles impaired the formation of blood vessels by inhibiting key processes of angiogenesis, namely VEGF‐induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells (HUVECs) and neovascularization on CAM (chorio‐allantoic membrane). Furthermore, the level of NO, a mediator of angiogenesis, was also significantly reduced in the presence of the POMos as was the VEGF‐induced phosphorylation of signal‐regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (AKT), signaling processes normally associated with the promotion of angiogenesis (Figure 13 h).

3.2.4 Interaction with Proteins Owing to their negative charge and their tendency to bind to neutral or hydrophilic surfaces, POMs interact with an array of proteins.138 Ectonucleotidases are membrane‐associated enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular nucleotides to the respective nucleosides and are thus involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes.139 They can be subdivided into four families, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatases (NPPs), alkaline phosphatases (APs), and ecto‐5′‐nucleotidase (eN). POMs are potent inhibitors of ectonucleotidases, with some of them being superior to known inhibitors (Figure 13 i; Supporting Information, Table S17).140 Crystallographic studies investigating the interaction of decavanadate, metatungstate, octa‐, and heptamolybdate with rat and bacterial NTPDase1 revealed that decavanadate and heptamolybdate bind either at the periphery (rat NTPDase) or deep inside the active site cleft (bacterial NTPDase) of the enzyme at positively charged patches, where they interact with substrate binding residues (Figure 13).141, 142 Therefore, it was suggested that enzyme inhibition occurs by blocking the nucleotide‐active site interaction. Octamolybdate (Figure 13 i) is located at the entrance of the active site cleft and could also interfere with substrate binding. Interestingly, one of the most potent inhibitors, metatungstate, binds distantly from the active site and therefore the inhibitory effect might result from POM‐mediated destabilization of the entire enzyme structure. Figure 13 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint POM‐binding sites of NTPDase1 from Legionella pneumophila. The structure of bacterial NTPDase1 consists of two domains (cyan and green cartoon) with the interface forming the active site cleft. The depicted structure is taken from PDB entry 4BVO142 as model example. The interacting amino acid residues are shown as sticks. Light blue spheres are tungsten, cyan spheres molybdenum, gray spheres vanadium, cyan/green sticks carbon, dark blue sticks nitrogen, red sticks oxygen. Dashed lines represent POM–protein interactions. Note that octamolybdate forms a covalent bond with a serine (Ser 127). The inhibition of human NTPDase1, also known as CD39, is of particular pharmacological interest as it converts ATP into adenosine, which is an important molecule in the suppression of the antitumor T cell response and therefore it is exploited by tumors to overcome immune response.143 NTPDase1 inhibition by metatungstate led to a significant in vivo suppression of murine B16‐F10 melanoma (inhibition rate ca. 86.1 %, 5 mg kg−1) and to a moderate reduction of murine colon adenocarcinoma (MCA‐38, ca. 27.3 %, 5 mg kg−1) in mice.144 Metatungstate was not active in NTPDase1 deficient tumor‐bearing mice confirming NTPDase1 inhibition as the mode of action. Further studies investigating the effect of several POMs on human NTPDase1‐3, NPP1‐3, and rat eN revealed that POMs were most efficient in inhibiting NTPDase1‐3 and NPP1, with some of them exhibiting inhibition constants in the nanomolar range (Supporting Information, Table S17).145, 146 [Co 4 (H 2 O) 2 (PW 9 O 34 ) 2 ]10− was identified as a very potent inhibitor of human NTPDase1‐3 (K i =4, 20 and 100 nm), being the most potent inhibitor of human NTPDase1 described to date. POMs are also potent inhibitors of tissue specific alkaline phosphatase (TSAP, from calf intestine) and of tissue non‐specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSAP, from pork and human), with some of them being active at nanomolar concentrations (Supporting Information, Table S17).145, 147 Regarding human TNSAP, [P 6 W 18 O 79 ]20− (K i =2.3 μm) is the most potent inhibitor.145 APs are highly expressed by osteoblasts to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate for bone mineralization. This osteoblastic activity is remarkably increased in prostate cancer, which preferentially metastasizes to bone, leading to dysregulated bone formation.148 Therefore, the inhibition of APs by POMs could be a promising strategy in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. A series of POMs were tested on several kinases showing high specificity for protein kinase CK2.149 Protein kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of proteins leading to their modification, that is, change in enzymatic activity, cellular location, or interaction behavior to regulate cellular processes such as signal transduction. Protein kinase CK2 is upregulated in many cancer types and thus associated with their increased proliferation rate and ability to suppress apoptosis.150 Derivates of the Wells–Dawson (IC 50 =1–70 μm) and Preyssler archetype (IC 50 =1–5 μm), and giant POM anions (IC 50 =8–70 μm), showed moderate to high inhibition of CK2. In contrast, smaller POMs such as Keggin derivates (IC 50 =60–1000 μm) were less active indicating that the POM structure roughly determines the inhibitory effect. Further analysis revealed that the POM binding site is located at an exposed site outside the ATP/peptide binding pocket and the catalytic cleft from where the POM could however interfere with the activation loop of CK2 (Supporting Information, Figure S4).151 A high‐throughput screening study assaying 400 POMs was performed to identify potential histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors revealing [{(n‐Bu)Sn(OH)} 3 GeW 9 O 34 ]4− as the most efficient HDAC‐inhibitor (IC 50 =1.1 μm) (Figure 14 j).48 HDAC is an enzyme that is responsible for the removal of the acetyl group from an acetylated lysine making histones to wrap DNA more tightly. This is an essential process as DNA expression is regulated by the acetylation and deacetylation of histones. HDACs are involved in cell‐cycle progression and differentiation and therefore disturbances in HDAC encoding genes are linked to tumor development rendering them promising targets.152 This rationale was confirmed by the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of [{(n‐Bu)Sn(OH)} 3 GeW 9 O 34 ]4−, which were discussed in Section 2.2.1. Several POMs like [V 10 O 28 ]6− or [P 2 W 18 O 62 ]6−, which are known to exhibit antitumor activity, have also been described as potent P‐type ATPase inhibitors (Figure 14 k).153-155 P‐type ATPases are a large group of ion pumps that play a crucial role in maintaining the ionic balance in cells and therefore have been described as potential molecular targets for the treatment of several diseases. P‐type ATPases like Na+/K+‐ATPase also act as signal transducer and their activity was found to be significantly changed in tumors making Na+/K+‐ATPase inhibitors particularly interesting as anticancer drugs.156 Therefore, the reported anticancer activity of some POMs, especially that of decavanadate and other POVs, may partially derive from their ability to inhibit P‐type ATPases. However, POM‐mediated P‐type ATPase inhibition is not tumor‐cell‐selective. Besides this, decavanadate induces mitochondria membrane depolarization and inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption in vivo rendering mitochondria the main toxicological target for decavanadate (Figure 14 l).157 The mechanism behind the anticancer activity of POM‐bisphosphonate (POM‐BP) complexes, which were discussed in Section 2.2.2, is supposed to be the inhibition of the prenylation of important proteins like the Ras subfamily, which belong to the class of small GTPase. The Ras genes are the most common oncogenes in human cancer, and point mutations within these genes result in the accumulation of activated Ras, which in turn causes a permanent cell growth‐promoting signaling, ultimately leading to cancer.158 Therefore, the Ras pathway is a promising biological target. BPs like Zol are known to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme supplying precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids that are essential for prenylation. In the same way, POM‐BP complexes could inhibit the prenylation of (mutated) Ras, preventing it from reaching its full functionality, and thus impairing tumor growth. This mechanism was supported by the finding that the addition of geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an isoprenol that is also used for protein prenylation, impaired the antitumor activity of Mo‐based POM‐BP complexes as prenylation was restored. Interestingly, the activity of V‐containing BP complexes was not affected by GGOH, suggesting that the activity of these complexes is governed by the POV unit and thus follows a POV‐based mode of action. Besides the discussed biomacromolecules, POMs interact with an array of other important proteins including phosphatases, kinases, polymerases, proteases, actin, sulfotransferases, and sialyltransferases (Figure 14 m).28, 138, 159-162 POM‐mediated inhibition of certain enzymes has a specific effect on the cell viability and may thus contribute to pharmacological activities. Some of these enzymes are membrane‐associated proteins of which targeting is facilitated as the POM does not has to enter into the cytoplasmic space for inhibition.",Polyoxometalates as Potential Next‐Generation Metallodrugs in the Combat Against Cancer,Wiley.com,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201803868

Abstrac…","Monitoring of the FITC labeled {Eu(SiW 11 O 39 ) 2 }–CMC within HeLa cells showed that the nanoparticles were preferably located in the perinuclear region in close proximity to the nuclei. 98 Clathrin‐mediated endocytosis was proposed as POM‐free chitosan nanoparticles are internalized by this pathway; however, this was later excluded as the cellular uptake of POM‐CT was not inhibited by the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine indicating a clathrin‐independent pathway. 99 Thus, macropinocytosis and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis were suggested as internalization pathways for, at least, POM‐CT hybrids as chitosan‐DNA‐poly(γ‐glutamic acid) complexes are uptaken by these pathways. 125

Nevertheless, it is still generally assumed that POMs are mainly taken up by cells by some form of endocytosis. Different POTs were traced within murine macrophage J774 cells revealing POM containing vacuoles within the cells, wherefore, it was suggested that POMs might bind to scavenger receptors and enter the cell by scavenger receptor‐mediated endocytosis. 124 Similarly, huge POMo nanoparticles such as (NH 4 ) 42 [{(Mo VI )Mo 5 VI O 21 (H 2 O) 6 } 12 {Mo 2 V O 4 (CH 3 COO) 30 }] were found to be located within endosomes that were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of Hep‐G2 cells, supporting internalization by an endocytotic pathway. 119

The antiproliferative activity of an anticancer drug is directly associated with its degree of cellular uptake. It is well accepted that POMs are able to penetrate cancer cells, as many studies have experimentally confirmed their location within the cytoplasmic space. 46 , 99 , 109 - 111 , 119 However, no convincing data has been reported revealing the exact mechanism. Owing to their large size and negative charge, POMs are supposed to be rather unable to penetrate the largely negatively charged cell membranes of mammalian cells. POMs such as the Keggin‐type were characterized as super chaotropic agents with a surprisingly high tendency to adsorb on neutral and hydrophilic surfaces, whereby POMs with lower charge densities were more chaotropic. 120 Owing to this feature, POMs exhibited destructive activity towards model cell membranes by adsorbing to the vesicle surface, followed by the formation of a stable POM–lipid conjugate, which finally desorbs from the membrane (Figure 10 ). 121 , 122 These desorption processes led to leaky membrane structures. Studies with anionic lipids revealed that depending on the charge density, the POM–lipid interactions can switch from electrostatic to hydrophobic nature, owing to the charge neutralization by cationic counterions. 123

3.2 Proposed Modes of Action and Biological Targets of Antitumoral Polyoxometalates

Figure 11 shows most of the putative mechanisms of antitumoral POMs in a comprehensive Scheme. The first suggested mechanism for the antitumor activity of POMs was that by Yamase, which was already mentioned in the introduction.19 Briefly, repeated reduction/oxidation cycles between the POM and cell components, most likely members of the electron transport chain, are supposed to interfere with ATP generation, which finally leads to apoptosis (Figure 11 a). The theory is widely accepted, as a series of studies revealed a putative correlation between the cytotoxicity and the redox potential of bioactive POMs.38-44 This correlation is a weak one and only applies to very closely related structures, as other factors like size, structure, and composition play also a significant role. In general, there is no unambiguous correlation between the anticancer activity of POMs and parameters such as POM size, total net charge, charge density, oxidation power, and archetype.

Figure 11 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Illustration of most of the proposed modes of action of antitumoral POMs. a) POM induced inhibition of ATP synthesis by interfering with the electron transfer chain (represented as dark blue entities, the inset shows a zoomed view of the chain). b) POM induced increase in ROS‐level (for example by oxidizing cell components) and depletion of the GSH pool (by GSH oxidation). c) POM induced enhancement of the expression of pro‐apoptotic components (Bax and Bim) and the reduction of the expression of anti‐apoptotic components (bcl‐2 and NF‐κB). d),e) Activation of the p53 and/or p38 pathway by POMs. Please note: the circles reading p38 and p53 do not represent the respective protein but the pathways. f) Induction of apoptosis by direct DNA damage. g),h) POM‐mediated inhibition of angiogenesis via interaction with bFGF and VEGF leading to the disruption of the VEGF/bFGF‐receptor interactions (receptors are indicated as yellow and brownish channels). Without VEGF/bFGF‐receptor binding, the ERK pathway cannot be activated leading to the breakdown of angiogenesis. i) Inhibition of ectonucleotidases by POMs leads to a distortion in the concentrations of nucleotides (NTP, NDP, and NMP) and nucleosides (Ns), which negatively affects the functioning of cancer cells. j) Inhibition of HDAC by POMs leads to the accumulation of acetylated histones, causing fatal changes in the expression of genes. k) Inhibition of P‐type ATPases has fatal effects on the cellular ion homeostasis. l) Decavanadate‐induced mitochondria membrane depolarization. m) Inhibition of other proteins that affect cell viability (for more details, see text of Section 2.3.1 and 3.2.5, and references therein). n) POM hybrids loaded with siRNA (siRNA is depicted as red RNA structure) downregulate HIF‐1, leading to the impairment of angiogenesis and the adaptation of cancer cells to the hypoxic environment. o) Immunostimulating activity of POMs by promoting the expression of antibodies and immune‐related components (for example, NK cells). The figure depicts the activation of NK cells via antibody binding enhancing the recognition of tumor cells (antigens are depicted as purple triangles) by NK cells. Dotted lines indicate that the reason of activation/deactivation (for example, enhanced/decreased expression) of certain components is not known. The release of cytochrome c (purple circle) triggers the apoptotic machinery of the cell, which ultimately activate the final executers of apoptosis (caspases).

3.2.1 Activation of Cell Death Pathways Apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy are types of cell death, which are generally highly sophisticated processes including complex signaling cascades that are tightly regulated. According to Section 2, a number of POMs induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway as no study describes, for example, the involvement of a death receptor, which is a hallmark for extrinsic apoptosis. The reason for this is that most POMs mainly induced “internal damage” by oxidative stress, which is signaled to mitochondria (Figure 12 b). Some POMs like the Wells–Dawson POM are able to induce apoptosis by affecting the expression of cell death regulators, for example, by increasing the amount of the pro‐apoptotic proteins Bax and Bim (Figure 12 c).126, 127 Other POMs, such as Krebs‐type, do also reduce the expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein bcl‐2 and the transcriptional factor NF‐κB (Figure 12 c).33, 34 Active NF‐κB is responsible for the expression of genes that protect the cell from undergoing apoptosis, however, many tumor types have a constantly active NF‐κB and therefore its inhibition represents a promising approach in cancer therapy. Furthermore, Krebs‐type tungstobismuthates are able to increase the expression of p53 activating apoptosis partially by this pathway (Figure 12 d).33 The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that induces anti‐carcinogenesis events such as cell growth arrest and inhibition of angiogenesis, making it the guardian of the genome and one of the most promising targets as about 50 % of human cancers are thought to be related to p53 mutations.128 Some POMs like the CoII containing Krebs‐type (H 2 im) 2 [(W(OH) 2 ) 2 (Co(H 2 O) 3 ) 2 (Na 4 (H 2 O) 14 )(BiW 9 O 33 ) 2 ] are able to enhance the activation of caspase‐3, the final executioner of apoptosis.35, 127 Na 7 [CrIIICuIIW 11 O 39 ] was observed to induce the upregulation of both cytochrome c and activated p38 in human ovarian SK‐OV‐3 cancer cells (Figure 12 e), despite its very low anticancer activity (IC 50 =1.87 mm).127 Cytochrome c is an essential component of the electron transport chain but plays also a decisive role in apoptosis as its release from the mitochondria into the cytosol upon apoptotic stimuli triggers apoptosis.129 Thus, POM‐induced overexpression of cytochrome c can promote cell death. p38 is a mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) that has oncogenesis suppressing properties as it is required for dormancy, that is, inhibition of the cell proliferation upon certain stress stimuli.130 Furthermore, Na 7 [CrIIICuIIW 11 O 39 ] is also able to trigger autophagy, which means that two cell death pathways can run in parallel. The same was observed for PM‐17 as it induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death in vitro and in vivo.18 The sandwich POM [H 4 {CuII 9 AsIII 6 O 15 (H 2 O) 6 }(AsIIIW 9 O 33 ) 2 ]8− exhibited remarkable activity against cancerous K‐562 (leukemia) and Hep‐G2 (liver) cells (IC 50 =0.4 μm for both) by affecting lysosomes in vitro, which led to the induction of both apoptosis and autophagy.131 The autophagy inducing property might originate from the AsIII containing unit as As 2 O 3 is known to induce autophagy in leukemia cells by increasing the level of Beclin‐1, a critical regulator of autophagy.132

3.2.2 DNA Interaction One of the main stimuli inducing intrinsic apoptosis is DNA damage. Therefore, the anticancer activity of a series of POMs and POM‐based hybrids was associated with DNA lesions but mainly induced indirectly as the negative charge of both molecules is supposed to prevent direct electrostatic interactions. However, some POM‐based structures were found to directly interact with DNA (Figure 12 f), for example, [(CpTi) 3 SiW 9 O 37 ]7− interacts strongly with DNA, most likely via its CpTi moiety.43, 47 These results were confirmed by the group of Habibi, which investigated the behavior of different CpM‐substituted Keggin POTs (M=ZrIV, TiIV, FeII) towards ctDNA and suggested a direct but noncovalent groove or outside stacking binding mode for the POM.46 Later, the number of POMs directly interacting with ctDNA was extended, including [PV 2 Mo 10 O 40 ]5− and [V 18 O 42 (H 2 O)]12−.31, 109-111 Despite the suggested groove or outside stacking interaction, the exact POM binding mechanism remains elusive. Another study investigating the interaction between heptamolybdate [Mo 7 O 24 ]6− and the DNA model bis(p‐nitrophenyl)phosphate showed that the POM was able to cleave the phosphodiester bond by a yet unknown mechanism.133

3.2.3 Inhibition of Angiogenesis Angiogenesis describes the formation of new blood vessels, a vital process in cell growth.134 As cancer cells are rapidly dividing, tumors need special blood supply to provide oxygen and other nutrients to continue their abnormal growth. Thus, they induce angiogenesis by activating various growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which stimulate the formation of blood vessels.

Several POMs like [V 10 O 28 ]6− or [P 2 W 18 O 62 ]6−, which are known to exhibit antitumor activity, have also been described as potent P‐type ATPase inhibitors (Figure 14 k).153-155 P‐type ATPases are a large group of ion pumps that play a crucial role in maintaining the ionic balance in cells and therefore have been described as potential molecular targets for the treatment of several diseases. P‐type ATPases like Na+/K+‐ATPase also act as signal transducer and their activity was found to be significantly changed in tumors making Na+/K+‐ATPase inhibitors particularly interesting as anticancer drugs.156 Therefore, the reported anticancer activity of some POMs, especially that of decavanadate and other POVs, may partially derive from their ability to inhibit P‐type ATPases. However, POM‐mediated P‐type ATPase inhibition is not tumor‐cell‐selective. Besides this, decavanadate induces mitochondria membrane depolarization and inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption in vivo rendering mitochondria the main toxicological target for decavanadate (Figure 14 l).157 The mechanism behind the anticancer activity of POM‐bisphosphonate (POM‐BP) complexes, which were discussed in Section 2.2.2, is supposed to be the inhibition of the prenylation of important proteins like the Ras subfamily, which belong to the class of small GTPase. The Ras genes are the most common oncogenes in human cancer, and point mutations within these genes result in the accumulation of activated Ras, which in turn causes a permanent cell growth‐promoting signaling, ultimately leading to cancer.158 Therefore, the Ras pathway is a promising biological target. BPs like Zol are known to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme supplying precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids that are essential for prenylation. In the same way, POM‐BP complexes could inhibit the prenylation of (mutated) Ras, preventing it from reaching its full functionality, and thus impairing tumor growth. This mechanism was supported by the finding that the addition of geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an isoprenol that is also used for protein prenylation, impaired the antitumor activity of Mo‐based POM‐BP complexes as prenylation was restored. Interestingly, the activity of V‐containing BP complexes was not affected by GGOH, suggesting that the activity of these complexes is governed by the POV unit and thus follows a POV‐based mode of action. Besides the discussed biomacromolecules, POMs interact with an array of other important proteins including phosphatases, kinases, polymerases, proteases, actin, sulfotransferases, and sialyltransferases (Figure 14 m).28, 138, 159-162 POM‐mediated inhibition of certain enzymes has a specific effect on the cell viability and may thus contribute to pharmacological activities. Some of these enzymes are membrane‐associated proteins of which targeting is facilitated as the POM does not has to enter into the cytoplasmic space for inhibition.",Polyoxometalates as Potential Next‐Generation Metallodrugs in the Combat Against Cancer,Literatumonline.com,https://pericles.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201803868

Many on the Canadian left have spent decades defending them,"The disturbing and tense situation playing out on Venezuela’s land borders with Brazil and Colombia turned deadly on Friday. The impoverished country’s neighbours have been permitting international flights to bring huge quantities of aid supplies into the region — aid that is desperately needed by the people of Venezuela. With their economy destroyed by socialism and mismanagement, even essential foods and medicines have become scarce. International relief, some of it flown on United States Air Force transport planes, has been arriving in Colombia and Brazil for weeks, enough to provide basic necessities and food to thousands of Venezuelans.

And Nicolás Maduro, the authoritarian Venezuelan leader no longer recognized as president by Canada and many of its allies, is refusing to let it in.

Not that anyone should be surprised. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has been escalating for years, while the government was busy further tightening its hold on power (with Maduro and his cronies not likely having to miss many meals themselves). Now that the country’s economy has collapsed, and with international aid sitting in warehouses along the border, it’s entirely in keeping with the regime’s lack of concern for its people that it would rather close the borders — in some cases by literally blocking bridges with impassable barriers — than admit there’s a problem and let the food in for people who desperately need it.

There have been growing protests near the border, and some reports of Venezuelans sneaking across to try reaching the aid. On Friday, Venezuelan soldiers opened fire on protestors along the country’s border with Brazil, killing at least one person and injuring at least a dozen. This is not the first time the military has killed its own people to preserve Maduro’s corrupt grip on power; it may not be the last. But it still marks a new low for the Bolivarian Revolution begun by Maduro’s thuggish mentor, Hugo Chavez. A mere twenty-one years after Chavez unleashed his grotesque experiment, soldiers are gunning down their countrymen for daring to object to their own government denying them badly needed emergency food and medicine — aid rushed in by other countries and sitting in warehouses just over the border.

Too many on the Canadian left have spent the last two decades defending their fellow socialists Chavez and Maduro as they gradually and ruthlessly destroyed what was once a prosperous, healthy nation. This is yet another opportunity, after many others, for Canada’s union leaders and the NDP to reconsider their support for the cruel Maduro regime, and add their voices to those calling for Venezuela to be not only freed, but fed.

But they won’t.","NP View: He’s shooting starving Venezuelans, yet somehow Canadian socialists still support Maduro",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-hes-shooting-starving-venezuelans-yet-somehow-canadian-socialists-still-support-maduro

On Tuesday, Premier Rachel Notley unveiled a $3.7 billion deal for Alberta to lease its own little railway, on Wednesday United Conservative leader Jason Kenney signed a giant cardboard ""guarantee"" on health care, and on Friday we'll have Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel fretting his hour on the Court of Queen's Bench stage arguing he should be allowed to run in the upcoming election campaign.



Notley would no doubt prefer not to be in the position of borrowing 4,400 rail cars from CN and CP to ship Alberta crude to market but this is what happens when the headline act ""Pipeline to Tidewater"" has been postponed indefinitely.

​Notley was hoping Prime Minister Trudeau would play a supporting role in the deal but he's busy starring in his own melodrama involving a former attorney general and a corruption prosecution against SNC-Lavalin.

Even though Trudeau agreed to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion last year, he apparently doesn't feel the need to ride to her rescue on the eve of the Alberta election this year.

Crude by rail





""The risk is in doing nothing,"" Notley told reporters Tuesday.Yes, but there's also a risk in doing something.



For Notley, the long-term risk is that this deal might not work out. On paper it will cost the province $3.7 billion but recoup $5.9 billion for a profit of $2.2 billion.



But for Notley the real risk here isn't long term economics but short term politics. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced a plan Tuesday to lease locomotives and rail cars to get oilsands crude to American and international markets. (Emilio Avalos/CBC)

Her multi-billion-dollar rail deal has painted a great big $3.7-billion target on her government's back — alongside a $7.5-billion deficit and a $50 billion-plus debt.



After mulling over the deal for a day, Kenney contacted CN and CP to tell them he will scrap the deal if he becomes premier.



""If elected, a United Conservative government will do everything within our power to cancel the NDP's reckless $4-billion expenditure of borrowed tax dollars to interfere in the market,"" said Kenney.



That prompted Notley to accuse Kenney, who has told his supporters to ""stay humble"" in the upcoming campaign, of displaying ""an unprecedented level of arrogance"" for already presuming he'll win. That left Notley to take centre stage in a three-year agreement with Canada's two major rail companies to ship 120,000 barrels of oil per day by tanker car.""The risk is in doing nothing,"" Notley told reporters Tuesday.Yes, but there's also a risk in doing something.For Notley, the long-term risk is that this deal might not work out.

When it comes to political theatre, though, Kenney is something of a carnival barker himself.

Health care guarantee

In a news conference Wednesday, he announced a UCP government would quickly conduct a performance review of Alberta Health Services ""to get more bang for the taxpayers' buck.""

That doesn't sound like a bad idea except that Kenney tends to suggest he can find efficiencies in administration when in fact Alberta spends the least amount of money of any province in health administration (3.3 per cent vs. a national average of 4.5 per cent).



And if Kenney wants to know why we spend so much on health care, look no further than the old Progressive Conservative governments that gave large salary hikes to doctors and refused to scale back rural hospitals.



The NDP has frozen wages for pretty much everyone on the health care system but that's a Band-Aid, so to speak, on an open wound.



Kenney also promised to maintain or increase health care spending and to maintain a universal, publicly funded health care system.



And, as if to make the promise legal, he signed a giant cardboard health care ""guarantee"" onstage.



Of course, this puts you in mind of his famous big, cardboard ""grassroots guarantee"" he signed onstage during the UCP leadership race where he insisted, ""The policies of the United Conservative Party must be developed democratically by its grassroots members, not imposed by its leader.""



But when some party members endorsed policy resolutions he didn't like at their founding convention last May, he declared, ""Guess what? I'm the leader. I get to interpret the resolution and its relevance to party policy.""



Sometimes political guarantees aren't worth the cardboard they're written on.​

​Mandel's ban

And finally we come to the tragicomedy that is the Alberta Party and leader Mandel's court case Friday where he is hoping to overturn a decision by Elections Alberta to ban him from elections for five years for failing to turn in financial documents on time last year.

Mandel has alternately complained that the fault was his chief financial officer's, that the rules were confusing, that the penalty is too severe. Mandel has alternately complained that the fault was his chief financial officer's, that the rules were confusing, that the penalty is too severe.

If this little tale was limited to Mandel, it would be sad enough but a half dozen other Alberta Party candidates are facing a similar fate. What's up with that?



For the sake of giving Albertans a choice in the upcoming election, I hope Mandel wins his case.



But voters will be forgiven for wondering if the Alberta Party is, to paraphrase Shakespeare, a party that struts and frets its hour upon the campaign stage, and then is heard no more.

Manitoba’s chief public health officer says substance abuse and a lack of prenatal care were common factors in many of those cases.,"WINNIPEG—At least 10 infants have been treated for syphilis in Manitoba in the last six months, and the public health office says the methamphetamine crisis could be exacerbating the outbreak. The number of people with syphilis has nearly tripled since 2014 — to 350 from 118. For women, it’s gone to 168 from 16 in four years.

Michael Isaac, Manitoba’s acting chief public health officer, says women can pass the bacterial infection on during pregnancy. Isaac says substance abuse and a lack of prenatal care were common factors in many of the cases. The province is urging people to practise safe sex and to get tested. Women should seek regular prenatal medical care, especially if they are intravenous drug users.

“I think the injection drug use that we are seeing in Manitoba certainly is linked with crystal methamphetamine use,” Isaac said Monday. “And we’ve noted that some of the moms with congenital syphilis have been using crystal meth and injecting drugs.” Winnipeg’s police chief has said the skyrocketing use of meth is creating a crisis for police, treatment centres and health-care services. The Addictions Foundation of Manitoba has said meth use increased by more than 100 per cent in adults and nearly 50 per cent in youth since 2014. Isaac said the rise in injection drug use is linked to the increase in blood-borne illnesses such as syphilis. Syphilis can have a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other conditions. Tests confirm whether a person has the infection and, once diagnosed, it is easily treated with penicillin.

“It’s a very treatable and preventable condition,” Isaac said. If untreated, syphilis can be passed on before or during a pregnancy and can result in birth defects or stillbirth.

Congenital cases of syphilis were rare in Manitoba and Isaac said no babies were born with the infection for decades before 2015. “We noticed in late 2018 and early 2019 a large increase in cases of congenital syphilis, especially the last six weeks.” Of those mothers, Isaac said, 70 per cent were using drugs. Health Minister Cameron Friesen said the outbreak is affecting hard-to-reach populations, in particular people with addictions, and that’s created a significant challenge. He said a plan has been developed by public health experts to increase testing and education, but there are not simple or easy solutions. Documents obtained by the Manitoba NDP in December have also shown a rise in communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis. NDP Opposition Leader Wab Kinew said the government has known about the connection with intravenous drug use but hasn’t acted on it. “We need a safe injection site in Winnipeg. We need more harm reduction measures,” he said. “We also need to have a variety of public health outreach steps taken.” Multiple provinces, including Alberta, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, are also seeing cases of congenital syphilis.","Spike in Manitoba babies treated for syphilis, substance abuse likely factor",Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/25/spike-in-manitoba-babies-treated-for-syphilis-substance-abuse-likely-factor.html

The ombudsman said the exact number of positions affected will be determined in the coming weeks. The Child and Youth Advocate’s office said it currently employs 75 people. The Progressive Conservative government announced the decision to roll the Child and Youth Advocate’s office into the office of the ombudsman in its fall fiscal update. Dube said plans to transfer the duties of the French languages services commissioner — which his office will also assume this spring — will be finalized soon. “With the added expertise of colleagues from the two former offices, we will focus on conducting high-quality investigations and bringing constructive change to these two new areas of our jurisdiction,” he said. “We will establish dedicated teams for both areas — bearing in mind that we must also work within the parameters the government has set in this legislation.” NDP children and youth critic Monique Taylor said the layoffs will hurt both the employees impacted and the youth they advocate for.

“These hard-working and caring employees will be laid off, and youth in care will be further disadvantaged, with the front-line staff they’ve come to rely upon ripped away,” she said in a statement. Taylor said the elimination of the Thunder Bay office will mean children and youth in Ontario’s north and Indigenous communities now have nowhere to turn for help close to home.

Premier Doug Ford hit with profanity and racial slurs by student protestors

Posted on by massmike

Premier Doug Ford was called a fg cracker by a bunch of young commies on Tuesday.

Student activists attempted to unfurl a protest banner in the legislative chamber at Queens Park during the first sitting of the year. As they were stopped by security, one young woman erupted with expletives.

Doug Ford can kiss my a, she yelled.

Then the young black woman followed up with a racial slur.

Youre a fg cracker! You know that? she yelled at the premier.

Outside the legislature students were rallying. They are upset that the Ford government is making changes to Ontarios student loans and grants program that the government says brings them in line with the federal program. The students are also upset at having their tuition cut and even for Ford referring to some student activities as crazy Marxist nonsense in a fundraising e-mail.

Did I mention all the crazy Marxist nonsense at the rally?

There was a Che Guevara flag, banners from the Young Communist League and a Marxist club, as well.

They have the right to protest outside, colleges and universities minister Merrilee Fullerton said. But in the chamber, I think we need to show respect.

It was a view echoed by Liberal leader John Fraser but not NDP leader Andrea Horwath.

Horwath refused to condemn or say anything negative about students using profanity and racial slurs in the legislature.

Theres no doubt emotions are running high, students are really worried, Horwath said.

384,Empty,2019-02-22T01:51:08Z,"Meg Davis, Waterfront Toronto’s chief development officer, told a federal ethics standing committee in Ottawa that the goal has always been to “build out the Quayside property,” so the expanded vision for the Port Lands comes as no surprise.","Meg Davis, Waterfront Toronto’s chief development officer and Kristina Verner, vice-president of innovation, sustainability and prosperity for the corporation appeared for before the federal ethics committee’s Liberal-majority standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics Thursday afternoon.

A senior Waterfront Toronto director told a hearing in Ottawa that it was known all along that Sidewalk Labs might need to go beyond redeveloping a 12-acre parcel near Parliament St. and Queens Quay and expand their vision to 350 acres in the Port Lands.

Standing committee member, and Conservative MP Peter Kent suggested to Davis that senior politicians and the general public in the GTA and beyond are now viewing the Sidewalk proposal as a “high profit real estate property development project rather than a technology partnership.”

Politicians at the local, provincial and federal level and the general public understood the development proposal was only for a 12 acres parcel of land called Quayside, but last week the Star revealed Sidewalk wants to broaden that to encompass the Port Lands — developing new neighbourhoods and a new light rail transit line throughout the entire area and getting a share of the property taxes, development fees and other benefits from increased land values — money that would normally go to the city’s coffers.

The two were asked about the corporation’s partnership with Google sister firm Sidewalk Labs to develop a proposal for a data driven residential neighbourhood on the waterfront.

Davis replied that the goal has always been to “build out the Quayside property” and that the original March 2017 RFP (request for proposals) for the project — which Sidewalk later won — envisioned an initiative that would be climate positive and improve transit and infrastructure on the waterfront.

“You need district energy systems, you need different electric grids, transportation systems. What does it take to get to these lofty objectives,” said Davis, adding: “12 acres probably doesn’t get you there.” This echoed a statement Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff made to the Star last week in the story about the Port Lands revelations.

She went on to say the RFP and subsequent July 2018 plan development agreement between Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk allowed for “thinking at scale” beyond Quayside — in other words an expanded vision.

“We were looking for innovative opportunities to help fund a waterfront LRT system,” Davis told the standing committee.

But committee member and NDP MP Charlie Angus disagreed with Davis’ version of events.

“The first map (in the RFP) was 12 acres. Quayside — but then the plan development agreement was for the whole designated waterfront area. Isn’t that rather unusual for one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in North America?” Angus asked Davis tersely.

“People who bid (on the RFP) thought it was only 12 acres. (That) was the understanding from the get-go,” Angus told Davis.

She replied that the “designated waterfront area” in the plan development agreement goes beyond Quayside.

A map in the agreement shows an area that takes in the Port Lands and also stretches west past the Rogers Centre.

A press release in July explaining the agreement says that the final plan for Quayside “may also bring forward proposals that work best at scale.”

The RFP does reference the potential for expansion.

One section says: “it may be beneficial to advance the solutions, processes and partnerships proven successful through the (Quayside) project to subsequent developments on the eastern waterfront.”

But Toronto developer Julie Di Lorenzo, who quit the Waterfront Toronto board last summer over her objections to the Sidewalk project, said after Thursday’s committee meeting it was always her belief as a board member that the deal with Sidewalk only pertained to Quayside.

She says she was a bit stunned to hear Davis embrace the expansion idea.

“From my time on the board, I was surprised to hear Waterfront Toronto representatives describing the (master plan Sidewalk is working on) as anything more than the Quayside lands,” Di Lorenzo told the Star, noting that the city of Toronto’s own web page on the project only refers to Quayside.

Davis pointed out that the proposal — Sidewalk is expected to put forward draft and final master plans later this year — must get approval from Waterfront Toronto and the city of Toronto.

Any agreements regarding development charges, or tax sharing or anything stemming from land values would also need city of Toronto approvals, she added.

After the meeting Angus, the standing committee member, said he still has many questions.

“I don’t know how you put forward a project that in the long-term is about a major real estate development for the entire waterfront and not make that clear from the get-go. I have that concern,” he said in a telephone interview from Ottawa.

“And they talk about, you need economies of scale and transit and you need to do it for climate change. All that might be true but that’s not what the conversation was for the RFP,” he added.","Sidewalk Labs vision for Port Lands was a possibility all along, senior Waterfront Toronto official says",Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/21/sidewalk-labs-vision-for-port-lands-was-a-possibility-all-along-senior-waterfront-toronto-official-says.html

The question came to a head over the weekend when documents, including a set of talking points, were released to the media. The documents suggested the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services was trying to control the message given to parents. In one email to staff, a manager in another jurisdiction noted the ministry “has asked us not to stray outside of their messaging.”

The issue boiled over Monday during question period at Queen’s Park.

Lisa MacLeod, the embattled minister of children, community and social services, told the legislature that allegations the program was frozen are “erroneous,” and that if the program had continued under changes introduced by the Liberals, it faced bankruptcy.

NDP leader Andrea Horwath shot back that the province would be be bankrupting families with its new program.

NDP MPP Monique Taylor was ejected from the legislature after accusing the government of “lying” to parents. Ottawa West-Nepean Progressive Conservative MPP Jeremy Roberts, who has a sibling with autism, did not stand up to applaud statements made by Premier Doug Ford and MacLeod, who is the MPP for Nepean. (A spokesman for Robert said he would not comment on the incident.) Ottawa South MPP John Fraser said parents had lost confidence in MacLeod and needed “a fresh set of eyes and ears” on the issue.

Meanwhile, the ministry released a statement saying agencies were instructed last October to bring in only new clients in three priority areas.

“At no point did Minister MacLeod instruct the Ministry of Children, Community and Social services to freeze the wait list,” said the statement. “These families were prioritized for services and supports following changes made to the Ontario Autism Program in January 2018, which placed significant funding pressures on the program budget that could not be supported within the allocated budget. Minister MacLeod secured the necessary investment upon taking office.”

In an interview Monday, Alex Munter, the president and CEO of CHEO, said that as of July 2018, the autism program at CHEO was facing a $8.2 million shortfall in a $25-million program because of the changes introduced in January 2018. As a result of the shortfall, CHEO cut discretionary expenses in the program and imposed a hiring freeze. CHEO also asked the province for more funding. “The shortfall would have had impacted services through CHEO,” Munter said. The autism program is different from the rest of the programs at CHEO, he said. In most other treatment areas, clinicians make decisions. In this program, the government dictates which children get services and how much. The program has been rebooted four times in the past three years and changing criteria has been hard for families, Munter said. But parents who called CHEO would have been told that if their child was not in one of the priority groups they would not be admitted into the program. “The reality is that we were working with a major budget shortage that we were trying to manage,” he said. “I can see why people thought we should have been more public. But we don’t normally start negotiations in a public kind of way. Our first step is to bring it to government.” Munter noted the issue has become a highly polarized, partisan debate. “We’re not going to participate in that.” It is still unclear how much individual families will receive under the new program, known as the “childhood budget,” which is targeted at low and middle-income families. It will depend on how long the child remains in the program. A child who enters the program at age two could receive as much as $140,000, but another child entering the program at seven could only receive as much as $55,000. Many parents are concerned they won’t meet the income test and will get little or nothing.

Sherri Brown, the mother of nine-year-old Quinn, said her son has been on the wait list ever since she moved to Ontario in September 2017 from British Columbia. “Thirty hours a week would change the entire trajectory of his disability. I wish I could afford 30 hours a week. I can’t,” Brown said.

The priority categories set by the province are “cherry-picking” who would receive services, she said. “For our kids, every months makes a difference. To halt a wait list for six months in unconscionable. This is a neurological disorder. Six months is forever.”

Meanwhile, Brown argues that funding for autism should be covered under the province’s Health Ministry, not the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. “Three independent medical professionals have indicated that Quinn needs this level of treatment. It’s the gold standard of treatment for children with autism,” she said.

“A three-year wait list wouldn’t fly for children with cancer. But it flies for our children.”

Ottawa-Centre MP for nine years and the son of former Ottawa mayor Marion Dewar, Dewar died on Feb. 6, a year after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. He was 56.

Numerous current and former politicians and officials attended the packed memorial service at Dominion Chalmers Church in downtown Ottawa. Among them were Ed Broadbent, the former federal NDP leader who was Ottawa Centre MP before Dewar and Catherine McKenna, the current Minister of the Environment who is current Ottawa Centre MP. Former Conservative cabinet member John Baird, who served as Foreign Affairs minister when Dewar was foreign affairs critic, was there, as was Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and Ontario’s Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell. They were among many politicians and local officials.

Dewar lived a very public and political life. He watched his mother in politics and worked on campaign before winning his first federal election in 2006. “Politics was part of his DNA,” said Brian Cornelius, the United Church minister who officiated at the memorial service.

Still, most of the words about Dewar’s life delivered at the service came from his family, including his wife Julia Sneyd, sons Nathaniel and Jordan, siblings, close friends and former staff on Parliament Hill who remembered him with laughter, music and tears.

Julia Sneyd read a letter she had penned to her husband.

“As we shed tears of sadness for a life too short, tears of joy for a life fully lived and tears of hope for a better world … you will always be my bubble of joy, love Julie,” she read.

Echoing the public goodbye message Dewar wrote before his death, Sneyd described the past year since his diagnosis as “a year of magical living that will give us strength in the years to come.”

In his letter, Dewar described his illness a gift. “In this time in between, I got to see the wonder of the world around us. This reinforced my belief that inherent in our community is a desire to embrace each other with kindness and compassion.”

Sneyd said that making sense of her husband’s dying “was our biggest challenge yet.”

She described daily walks during the final months of his life in which he would talk about his illness and the future with Sneyd and their sons Nathaniel and Jordan.

“I know it was hard to only walk when you spent a lifetime in fast forward. Sometimes I think you actually lived until 80, you just compressed it.”

She said his work with children and youth will live on in Youth Action Now, the youth leadership project he launched last year.

As a politician, she said, Dewar excelled at bringing people together and was a model of the “roll up your sleeves” approach.

Dewar died of terminal glioblastoma, the same kind of cancer that killed Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie in 2017. Dewar spoke publicly about his diagnosis and took part in a clinical trial that he hoped might benefit others diagnosed with the aggressive cancer.

He considered devoting all of his time to his family and friends after his diagnosis but was inspired to do more after the shooting at Parkland High School in Florida and the response of surviving students there. He said that gave him hope for the future. That is why he launched Youth Action Now, a youth leadership initiative.

“A better world is possible,” he said at the time. “I believe in the power of the next generation of change leaders to get us there. I want to do my part in unleashing that power.”

The two-hour memorial opened with a smudging ceremony by his friend Claudette Commanda, a First Nations activist and University of Ottawa law professor.

“Thank you my friend for all that you have done for my people.”

387,Empty,2019-02-25T10:00:00Z,"Don’t expect to see the much-discussed national pharmacare plan in the March budget, writes David Olive.","Universal pharmacare has long been in place widely in Europe. The Liberal-dominated Commons health committee called last year for universal pharmacare, because about 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for drugs. And roughly one in 10 Canadians goes without prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

In the spring budget, just over three weeks from now, the Trudeau government will once again pass on the chance to finally give Canadians the universal pharmacare that doctors and a multitude of studies have shown is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the country’s prescription-drug bill.

That’s not what the doctor ordered, but it is what the insurance lobby wants. And the Trudeau government will oblige the private insurers, who fear having to compete with universal pharmacare.

Morneau will speak glowingly of how the Trudeau government is “filling the gaps” in our patchwork system of drug spending by government, private drug plans, and the $3.6 billion that Canadians spend out of pocket on prescriptions. Actually, Morneau will add complexity to the patchwork system rather than streamline it.

But in his next budget, which was set last week for March 19 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau will reject that holistic solution. He will instead announce narrowly targeted partial coverage of selected patient groups.

A government that has already broken its promise to balance the books by now understandably blanches at the estimated $20.4 billion annual cost of universal pharmacare. But the country’s total drug bill would actually drop by an annual $4.2 billion, according to the federal budget watchdog, due to volume buying by a single provider.

Putting private-sector insurers ahead of the people doesn’t sound like an effective means of winning a tight election contest in October.

The Alberta election campaign hasn’t officially started yet, and already the man poised to win it has effectively declared war on the rest of the country.

As premier, after a provincial election that must be held by May 31, Jason Kenney will demand that Ottawa sunder the federation by withholding transfer payments from provinces that don’t do Alberta’s bidding (that would be B.C., Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario) by deep-sixing their misgivings about new heavy-oil pipelines in their backyards.

If those pipelines don’t rapidly materialize, Kenney will hold a nationally divisive Alberta referendum on the equalization-payments system. And he wants Ottawa to debauch the Federal Court of Appeal, which ordered a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by using a Constitutional provision to overturn that decision.

At home, Kenney will set Indigenous communities against each other, favouring pro-pipeline communities with subsidies (that sure sounds like a bribe), and withholding the same from pipeline opponents.

He’ll throw Alberta teachers into confusion over elements of the curriculum that strike him as an NDP socialist plot. And he’ll strip farm workers of recently won means of redress for workplace injuries, on the untested theory that a safe farm is an unprofitable one.

Premier Rachel Notley has already blamed Canada for Alberta’s self-inflicted woes. Expect four more years of the same, only ramped up to firebrand level.

But understand that the next spell of Wildrose Country vitriol is coming from a good place. Kenney says he is simply “moving Alberta from an apologetic or defensive posture to an assertive posture.”

Apologetic? We await with interest a list from Kenney of Alberta’s apologies.

No rush, our patience is infinite.

Tariff-bully Trump: First Canada, now Germany

Canada may soon have an ally in Germany in our mutual despair over the U.S. as a threat to our economies.

Germany is bracing for the same 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. auto imports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Canada with in pressuring Ottawa for a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that neither Ottawa nor Canada’s business community much likes.

The looming tariffs on the German auto sector threaten to pitch Europe’s biggest economy into recession.

Recall that Trump justifies America’s continued 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian steel on the specious grounds that imported Canadian steel girders somehow threaten U.S. national security.

A long-awaited report by Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a former steel baron, is expected to make the same bogus assertion about imports from Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG.

Likely the best way this turns out is a compromise that imposes quotas on German auto imports, but that would be damaging in reducing the revenues of a key German economic sector.

A more productive outcome would be a German commitment to make more vehicles in the U.S. The Germans already do so, of course.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said recently she doesn’t understand how the BMWs built in South Carolina are a threat to U.S. national security. She might be wiser to put ironies aside and accurately broadcast Trump’s tariffs as an attack on Europe, given that the German auto sector assembles vehicles and sources parts widely across that continent.

None of this would be an issue, of course, if only Detroit made cars as well as the Germans, who perfected the internal-combustion engine in the 19th century and have never looked back.

388,Empty,2019-02-23T16:31:10Z,Liberals pounce! The post Trump announces new nominee for U.N. ambassador appeared first on Hot Air.,"As is his way, President Trump announced on Twitter Friday evening that he’s made a decision on who will fill the vacancy created by Nikki Haley’s resignation. He’s chosen to nominate the current ambassador to Canada, Kelly Knight Craft, to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She has some heavy-hitters in her corner.

The opening came up when former Fox News producer and State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert dropped out of consideration due to a personal issue – allegedly her nanny is in the U.S. legally but lacking the proper visa for work. By the way, how is it in 2019 that nominees for top jobs in government are still getting sidetracked because of employment issues with household staff? This allegation conjured up memories of the first purge of nominations due to domestic help issues back in the days of the Clinton administration.

I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2019

As I said, she has some heavy-hitters in her corner. She even has the backing of Nauert’s boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Craft emerged as the front runner for the post after being backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, officials said.

Nikki Haley tweeted out her approval, too.

Congratulations to Kelly Craft. She’s done a great job representing us as @USAmbCanada and we know she’ll be a strong voice for America at the United Nations. #USstrong🇺🇸 https://t.co/5zude3JVXs — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) February 22, 2019

Craft is the current U.S. ambassador to Canada. Pompeo’s statement was brief and to the point.

“Ambassador Craft has been an outstanding advocate for America’s national security and economic interests in Canada and she is extremely well-qualified to do the same at the United Nations,” he continued. “I look forward to her confirmation and continuing to work with her at the United Nations.”

McConnell’s statement included a mention that Craft is a native of Kentucky.

“Kelly Craft is a strong advocate for American interests and will be a powerful representative of our great nation at the U.N.,” his statement read. “She has a long record of service to her state and the nation and I’m confident she will continue to serve with distinction as America’s voice to the world at the United Nations. I was proud to recommend this remarkable Kentuckian to President Trump.”

So, who is she? Let’s go to her bio for a little more information.

A third-generation Kentuckian, Ambassador Craft demonstrates a deep commitment to her home state by serving in several leadership roles with the Salvation Army of Lexington and the Center for Rural Development, a non-profit dedicated to economic development in rural Kentucky. She also served on the Boards of Directors for the Kentucky Arts Council, the Lexington Philharmonic, YMCA of Central Kentucky, and the United Way of The Bluegrass. With a deep commitment to education, Ambassador Craft has served on the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, and co-founded the Morehead State University Craft Academy for Excellence in Science and Mathematics which nurtures the academic talents of young Kentuckians. In the private sector, Ambassador Craft founded a successful marketing and business advisory firm providing leadership advice to businesses in her community and across the country. In 2007, President George W. Bush appointed Ambassador Craft as an alternate delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.

She certainly has more experience than the relatively inexperienced Nauert. She’s a former Bushie and she’s been instrumental in putting together the Trump administration’s replacement to NAFTA, now known as USMCA. She will come under fire from the climate change extremists on the left as she takes a reasoned, moderate view of scientific findings in line with most conservatives. She doesn’t sign on to the hysteria that the world will soon end if the U.S. doesn’t agree to cripple our economy with excessive regulations and government overreach. Oh, and her husband is president of a coal producer and a big donor to Republican candidates, including Trump. The horror.

She faced early scrutiny, however, after she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that she believed scientists on “both sides” of the climate change debate. “I think that both sides have their own results, from their studies, and I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science,” Knight Craft had said. According to Open Secrets, a non-profit group tracking political contributions, Knight Craft’s husband, Joe Craft, who is president of coal producer Alliance Resource Partners, donated $1 million to Trump’s 2017 inauguration fund. He also donated $371,100 to Republican candidates during the 2018 election cycle, according to Open Secrets.

I can hear the snarling and gnashing of teeth now from our environmental betters on the left. Here’s a good example from California Rep. Ted Lieu. His district includes Beverly Hills, you know, the Hollywood celebrities who preach the gospel of climate change yet haven’t given up their private jets and mansions.

Dear @USAmbCanada Kelly Craft: Here are both sides: Side 1: We have 12 years to significantly reduce greenhouse gases or our children face catastrophic consequences. Side 2: We have 20 years to significantly reduce greenhouse gases or our children face catastrophic consequences https://t.co/gHgVc5OGvE — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 23, 2019

We’ll see how Craft’s nomination hearing goes. As long as McConnell can keep Senate Republicans together, she should be able to win a floor vote. Maybe she can even get the vote of coal country’s Senator Joe Manchin.",Trump announces new nominee for U.N. ambassador,Hotair.com,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/02/23/trump-announces-new-nominee-u-n-ambassador/
389,Empty,2019-02-22T23:36:35Z,After reporting a record number of B.C. real estate audit assessments in 2018 – amounting to $140.7 million – the Canada Revenue Agency is expected to receive a treasure trove of data from the B.C. government tying home ownership to income declarations. The p…,"After reporting a record number of B.C. real estate audit assessments in 2018 – amounting to $140.7 million – the Canada Revenue Agency is expected to receive a treasure trove of data from the B.C. government tying home ownership to income declarations.

The province is estimating it will collect $642 million over the next four years from the newly implemented BC speculation and vacancy tax, aimed at satellite families and those who leave their secondary urban homes empty for most of the year.

Whether these 2019 budget estimates hold water will partly depend on what the government deems to now be the “most advanced auditing processes in the country,” thanks in part to a suite of new efforts to collect information on home ownership.

Complex audits are bound to follow the submission of speculation tax declaration forms, policy and tax experts suggest.

The annual 2% tax against a satellite family’s assessed home value is designed to bridge a policy gap that has led to tax avoidance attributable to trends in global migration and the internationalization of B.C. real estate.

In essence, satellite family breadwinners earn income abroad while having their families live in B.C. The household thus pays little income tax in Canada but utilizes social services, the bulk of which is paid for by such taxes.

B.C. real estate audits lucrative for the taxman

In 2015 the CRA augmented its compliance program for B.C. and Ontario real estate audits. Last month the agency issued a report claiming it had collected $140.7 million from 1,417 real estate audits in B.C. alone, from April, 2018, to December, 2018. That’s $99,294 per audit, well above the three-year average of $45,182 per B.C. audit, and miles ahead of Ontario’s average of $17,241 per audit.

Tax collectors are getting more efficient, it appears, as 1,470 B.C. real estate audits from April 2015 to March 2016 generated only $18.5 million in evaded taxes.

In B.C., $173.4 million of the $310.4 million recovered in taxes – from 6,861 audits since April 2015 – is income tax related (lifestyle audits of owners of expensive homes and capital gains assessments on home sales). The other portion relates to unreported GST on sales and house flipping. Ontario’s 31,749 real estate audits since April 2015 brought in $547.4 million. Overall, the CRA also applied $70.9 million in penalties for knowingly making false statements.

The $642 million estimated new tax revenue is payment of the speculation tax only. The B.C. government says it has not assessed the amount of tax from unreported worldwide income or capital gains could be recovered from the data it collects for the speculation tax. After Ministry of Finance experts declined an interview request from Glacier Media, the government said it does expect the speculation tax auditing process to help identify overseas tax evasion and thus the ministry is expected to flag audit leads for the CRA.

Out migration and expensive homes

B.C. technically defines a satellite family as one in which reported worldwide household income is greater than local income.

Satellite family arrangements can be observed by looking at investor-class immigrant “out-migration.”

A government study of the now defunct federal investor immigrant program (foreigners paying an $800,000 loan for permanent residency), favoured by Chinese nationals, showed “out-migration” rates of investor immigrants after 10 years was 26.2 %, well above any other immigrant stream.

As an example, from 2006 to 2010, Canada admitted 13,151 investor immigrants and 34,544 of their spouses and dependents. According to the 2016 census, there remained only 7,590 of those investor immigrants and 27,370 spouses and dependents, showing a disproportionate number of breadwinners left the country within five years.

The average assessed value of homes owned by investor class immigrants in Metro Vancouver, in 2018, was $1.78 million for those admitted by the federal government and $2.2 million for those entering via Quebec, according to a recent Statistics Canada study. Furthermore, recent investor immigrants (since 2009) own single detached houses with average values of either $3.11 million for federal investors or $3.30 million for Quebec investors.

Of 121,650 investor immigrants admitted since 1986 and still declaring residency in Canada, 52% are now located in British Columbia, per census data.

Tax tries to close “bad tax setup”

Satellite family arrangement have given rise to wealthy people – often foreign nationals or recent immigrants – with access to foreign sources of money having a greater advantage in owning homes in Metro Vancouver than local income earners, said Josh Gordon, assistant professor at Simon Fraser University’s School of Public Policy.

Foreign money inflows into real estate by various means have decoupled housing prices from local income earners, Gordon contended, pointing to widely available data of the Vancouver real estate phenomenon where relatively low incomes are reported in some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Canada.

Gordon said the purpose of the speculation tax is to close the gap on a “huge subsidy” due to a “bad tax setup.”

“It’s a tax avoidance problem, not purely tax evasion. This arrangement is perfectly legal and that’s the problem,” he argued.

“Over time much of the expensive property will come to be owned by people outside the labour market,” said Gordon.

Gordon said presumably higher consumption based taxes paid by satellite families are an inadequate substitute for any unreported or even reported worldwide income.

“Those families will be using the education and health care system for much of their life. The purchase of a couple luxury vehicles does not capture the services they will consume,” said Gordon, adding that even if worldwide income is diligently declared and paid (minus the home country’s tax assessment), Canada’s social systems are still disadvantaged.

Richmond’s Andersen Tax LLP international tax accountant Steven Flynn said at first glance the speculation tax should be able to capture those families whose breadwinner is not filing Canadian taxes. Should a satellite family try to file a speculation tax exemption, the federal and provincial governments should be able to cross reference low income to high property value, via the auditing system, said Flynn.

For satellite families, “in general terms, by filing for an exemption under the B.C. speculation and vacancy yax, you’re admitting to a government agency that you’re a Canadian resident for income tax purposes. The expectation is the individual is subject to Canadian income tax of their worldwide income,” said Flynn.

Some audits of overseas spouses could be tricky, said David Duff, professor and director of the LL.M. in Taxation program at University of British Columbia’s Peter A. Allard School of Law.

Duff said people make arrangements to ensure that they are not residents in Canada for tax purposes. So one could remain a non-resident for tax purposes even if their de facto Canadian household pays the speculation tax.

“The key is that they’re not residents for Canadian tax purposes. Residence for tax purposes is not the same thing as citizenship or permanent residence status,” he explained.

Opaque, if not non-existent, spousal status; children (students) put on the title of homes; income transferred by the non-resident spouse from offshore corporations; and cash “gifts” to the family makes for a difficult gambit for Canadian auditors, should initial red flags, such as low income declarations from expensive homes, arise, Duff said.

“Perhaps the [speculation] tax will trigger real or fictitious separations for tax purposes,” he said.

Flynn said under the federal tax act, overseas cash gifts do not count as worldwide income.

And so, said Duff, “since the CRA has no way to audit this income directly, it will have to rely on whatever information it is able to obtain from the jurisdiction in which the spouse is a resident.”

For instance, according to the Canada-China Income Tax Agreement a person shall be deemed a resident for tax purposes first and foremost if “he has a permanent home available to him.”

If the person has homes in both countries the tiebreaker is where most personal and economic relations lie. If this cannot be determined then nationality determines tax liability.

The agreement eliminates double taxation in the event a person is deemed a resident for tax purposes in both countries (and presumably files tax returns in both countries as mandated to do so).

Polling indicates the BC NDP’s new speculation tax is supported by four in five British Columbians, but the opposition BC Liberals and special interest groups have panned its implementation, citing objections such as allegedly unclear and unfair exemptions and privacy concerns about providing one’s social insurance number.

“I think its revealing that someone would be more concerned about connecting income tax data to property ownership than about widespread tax avoidance,” countered Gordon, who seems confident the tax will do what it is intended to do.

Flynn said collection of a SIN should not be a concern and would appear necessary to make the tax effective.

Bryan Short, director of the BC Freedom of Information and Privacy Association, said his group is “monitoring” the tax.

“If the B.C. government can demonstrate that the collection of SINs is absolutely necessary to the facilitation of the speculation tax, then they are not overstepping boundaries,” said Short, via email.",B.C. real estate audits reveal widespread tax evasion,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/22/widespread-tax-evasion-real-estate-audits-bc/

From data breaches to phone scams seeking to collect your information to sell on the black market, it could happen to anyone.

But as some 27,000 Canadians report being victims of identity theft every year — a number that the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says is vastly underreported — a Marketplace investigation reveals Canada is doing little to match the strength of protections offered in the U.S.

Marketplace began looking into identity theft protections after receiving a leaked database of nearly 3,000 Canadians who fell victim to a low-interest credit card scam operating out of one overseas call centre.

As part of its research, Marketplace tested two services offered to identity-theft victims by Canada's two credit-reporting bureaus, Equifax and TransUnion, and learned that they won't necessarily prevent the risk of fraud.

Credit monitoring: 'It's a flaw in the system'

The top advertised product for both Equifax and TransUnion is credit monitoring — a service that costs between $11.95 and $29.95 a month, depending on the plan.

Marketplace tested each bureau's recommended plan, at $19.95 a month, by having two producers sign up with both companies. Call-centre staff for the companies said that with these products, clients can expect an email notification whenever ""key changes"" occur to their credit reports, including any inquiries or new accounts opened.

The two producers then applied for six different credit cards — three apiece — with major banks across Canada. As each bank made inquiries into the producers' files, an email notification was only received from one credit bureau — never both — and always one day after the application was submitted.

Some of the sensitive information leaked to Marketplace included credit card numbers, social insurance numbers and addresses — even recent account balances. (CBC)

Equifax and TransUnion both declined requests for an on-camera interview, but each credit bureau told Marketplace through email that financial institutions typically pull credit reports from only one bureau.

This means that in order to ensure consumers are getting a full picture of their credit reports, they would need to sign up for monitoring with both bureaus, at a cost of nearly $500 a year.

""Definitely it's a flaw in the system,"" said Claudiu Popa, a cybersecurity expert and author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook. ""No amount of monitoring will give you 100 per cent guarantee that you're going to be protected against identity theft.""

Even if a consumer does cough up the hundreds of dollars each year, Popa says credit monitoring won't do anything to prevent identity theft.

""It's a reactive system,"" he said. ""In many cases, these provide nothing more than a false sense of security.""

Fraud alerts: 'They definitely didn't protect me'

When Robert Darch had his wallet stolen, the North Vancouver man knew one of the first things to do was to alert both credit bureaus.

""I thought I was doing the proper due diligence that one needs to do when you have your ID stolen or your wallet stolen,"" said Darch.

He says both Equifax and TransUnion placed a fraud alert on his account, which triggers a notice on someone's credit report, saying they may have been a victim of identity theft.

Legislation in Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick says that if a fraud alert is placed on someone's credit file, a lender must take reasonable steps to verify someone's identity before a new account can be opened. All other provinces and territories have no legislation around fraud alerts.

With these alerts in place, Darch said he expected someone would call him if there was suspicious activity on his file. ""I thought once you notify Equifax, once you notify TransUnion, there's like a firewall in place and you are protected,"" he said.

It wasn't until CTV News knocked on his door, wanting to know why he was selling illegitimate phones on Craigslist, that he realized the fraud alerts hadn't worked.

Watch Robert Darch explain why credit alerts didn't work for him:

Someone using Darch's identity had managed to open two phone accounts with his personal information, and was selling the phones online under Darch's name.

While Darch was able to quickly clarify the situation with the news crew, he was left concerned that the protection offered by the credit bureaus didn't work.

""I definitely wasn't covered, wasn't protected.""

Marketplace's producers also placed fraud alerts on their accounts in Ontario, where specific legislation exists. And while no credit cards were approved, producers only received phone calls to verify their identity three times out of five.

""I don't think they have any teeth,"" said Darch about fraud alerts. ""I don't think that they are going to protect Canadians. They definitely didn't protect me.""

Both Equifax and TransUnion told Marketplace through statements that it is up to the lending organization to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant.

Equifax added: ""We believe it would be a mistake to discourage consumers from signing up for fraud alerts. We believe fraud alerts are an effective way to help identify fraudulent activity and help better protect consumers against identity theft.""

Canada behind in identity theft protections

Several experts Marketplace spoke with agree one of the best ways to safeguard against identity theft is a credit freeze, which gives the consumer control of their credit by allowing them to lock their file.

Even the consumer won't be able to access any credit until they unlock the freeze. As a result, potential lenders and fraudsters can't open new accounts or even inquire about their credit.

The product is offered for free by Equifax and TransUnion in the U.S. by law — but it's not available in Canada.

""Canadians have the right to know what's happening with their personal information,"" said Popa. ""There's absolutely no reason those same companies should not be offering credit freezes in Canada.""

Claudiu Popa is a cybersecurity expert who believes credit freezes should be offered in Canada — and for free. (Jenny Cowley/CBC)

The U.S. law to mandate free credit freezes passed in May 2018 after a public outcry following the 2017 Equifax data breach, though paid credit freezes had already been available there for more than a decade.

""In Canada, we have yet to catch up,"" said Popa, who would like to see credit freezes applied by default and for free.

When asked why Equifax doesn't offer credit freezes to Canadians, the company said: ""We are monitoring recent changes made to this service in the United States to see how consumers are responding to changes in the lock/freeze capability, as well as changing Canadian consumer needs in order to create the solutions which best meet those needs.""

In a previous statement, Equifax told Marketplace that ""unless it is an industry-wide requirement, it would present a false sense of security to consumers.""

TransUnion did not respond to questions about why it doesn't offer credit freezes in Canada.

Lenders and creditors pay credit agencies to access customer credit reports. But major banks in the U.S. told Marketplace that if a customer has a credit freeze, they can't access the data and don't have to pay.

Darch believed a credit freeze would have saved him a lot of hassle and embarrassment.

""I don't see a good reason why we can't have that in our country,"" he said. ""And I really wish that would be fast-tracked into place, so other people don't have the misfortune that I've had.""

Ontario credit freeze law in limbo

In Canada, provincial and territorial governments have the power to mandate that Equifax and TransUnion provide credit freezes for Canadians. Marketplace reached out to all 13 provinces and territories, and none have plans to introduce new legislation around the issue.

But Ontario has come close.

Just before 2018's provincial election, the Wynne government had passed legislation that would have forced TransUnion and Equifax to offer free credit freezes to Ontarians. Bill 8, the Access to Consumer Credit Reports and Elevator Availability Act, received royal assent, but the Liberals were voted out of power before the law became active.

The current Conservative government has told Marketplace there are no plans to finalize the legislation.

While still in Opposition, Consumer Services Minister Bill Walker told the Legislature that he supported credit freezes during an April 2018 reading of the bill. ""We have to have the ability to protect our information and know what's being used or what's being given to people out there,"" he said at the time.

But after more than seven months in office, there are still no plans to push the law forward.

After Marketplace reached out to the minister's office multiple times, it released a statement attributed to Walker that said the issue of consumer protection is on its department's radar.

""Consumer protection, as well as ensuring consumers know they can trust the government to implement effective rules, is our top priority.""

When Marketplace approached Walker at a public event for further clarification, he responded: ""I will commit to you that I will go and look at it.""

According to Popa, the issue is one that requires government intervention.

""When it comes to credit-monitoring bureaus, we cannot trust them to give us 100 per cent visibility into the risk of identity theft,"" he said. ""Canadians have the right to know what's happening with their personal information.""",Credit freezes are one easy way to protect against identity fraud — but they're not available in Canada,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-identity-theft-credit-monitoring-freeze-1.4937903
391,Empty,2019-02-22T21:05:56Z,It's already clear where this whole affair is heading,"On Thursday, Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council — the top civil servant in the federal government — came out swinging against the recent allegations that have thrown the Liberal government into disarray. Specifically, after a long, eyebrow-raising introduction that had very little to do with the matter at hand, Wernick acknowledged that former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould had indeed been “pressured” to grant SNC-Lavalin a break from criminal prosecution on bribery charges and move towards a settlement in the form of a remediation agreement. Indeed, he had done some of the pressuring himself. If this was a problem, Wernick said, Wilson-Raybould should have spoken up.

But, Wernick insisted, this wasn’t inappropriate pressure. “I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it (her decision) right,” was his delightful turn of phrase. To Wernick, this was somehow materially distinct from the kind of “undue” or “inappropriate” pressure the Liberals have been insisting never occurred.

If this was a problem, Wernick said, Wilson-Raybould should have spoken up

The Liberal defensive lines have fallen back some as this scandal progressed. First, of course, the line was that Wilson-Raybould had not been “directed” — the prime minister himself stuck to that one quite closely for days. It was an odd thing for him to say, as the original Globe and Mail story that kicked this whole affair off had never said the former attorney general was directed, but rather that the Prime Minister’s Office had tried pressuring her. When that non-denial didn’t help, the Liberals shifted gears slightly. Consider Monday’s resignation letter by Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s now-former principal secretary: “I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in (the prime minister’s) office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould,” he wrote.

How the Liberals reconcile that categorical denial with Wernick’s subsequent admission that he is “sure the minister felt pressure” remains to be seen. But it’s already clear where this whole affair is heading. Unless Wilson-Raybould ultimately says nothing, or suddenly starts offering complete, if belated denials that she was pressured, the Liberals are going to find themselves arguing that this accomplished Indigenous woman simply overreacted when a series of men tried to pressure her into making a decision that was rightfully hers to make — and if she’d been bothered by the pressure, it was her responsibility to take action.

It would be an interesting response. It’s possible that senior Liberals might even believe there is some truth to it. But if that’s the best they’ve got, it will be something to see feminist, progressive Trudeau resorting to “blame her” as his defence against a scandal that continues to bog down his government.",NP View: Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin defence is awkwardly shaping up to be ‘blame her’,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-trudeaus-snc-lavalin-defence-is-awkwardly-shaping-up-to-be-blame-her
392,Empty,2019-02-22T22:52:00Z,The Star breaks down five key issues in the Doug Ford government’s proposed policing legislation.,"When Ontario’s Attorney General proposed new policing legislation earlier this week, the message was clear: officers are “everyday heroes” who have the government’s unwavering support. “Our police deserve our respect,” said Caroline Mulroney at an announcement at Halton Regional Police Service headquarters, unveiling the Doug Ford government’s proposed plans to “fix” policing laws brought in under the previous government less than a year ago.

Mulroney was backed up by Sylvia Jones, the minister of community safety and correctional services, who said the Liberals’ omnibus policing legislation — known as the Safer Ontario Act, or Bill 175 — was a “disaster” and the “most anti-police legislation in Canadian history.” But hours later once the hefty 363-page legislation landed at Queen’s Park, it became evident the proposed legislation isn’t a complete rewrite of the previous government’s laws, which when passed in March were hailed as “historic” for strengthening police oversight. Some key parts are, in fact, identical.

Article Continued Below

What it is: Right now, police are expected to notify the SIU whenever it’s reasonable the watchdog’s mandate could be invoked: namely, when someone has died, been injured, or alleges they were sexually assaulted during any encounter with police. If there’s doubt, police are expected to err on the side of caution and let the SIU decide whether the threshold for an investigation has been met. Has it changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes, though more in the spirit of the legislation’s interpretation. Mulroney specified that police services will no longer be expected to call the SIU for certain kinds of deaths — like when officers are present for a suicide, or when someone dies of a heart attack in their presence — provided its reasonably clear police conduct was not a contributing factor.

Article Continued Below

The intent, Mulroney said, is to spare officers a lengthy and stressful investigation into how they tried to save a life, and free up the SIU’s time and resources to focus on cases core to its mandate. In cases such as deaths and injuries caused by use of force, or allegations of sexual assault, notification of the SIU will still be mandatory. When the watchdog probes cases of an officer unsuccessfully attempting to save a life, “he or she is treated like a suspect,” Mulroney said, and “this is not what the SIU should be doing.” Why it matters: The issue has been a thorny one between police and the watchdog, most recently over to the growing number of officers carrying naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses — yet another instance where an officer may fail at saving a life, then become the subject of an SIU probe. But the debate dates back more than two decades, and in 1998 the disputes prompted a review of by former Ontario Superior Court judge George Adams. “The issue of notification must be treated more like that of calling an ambulance — when in doubt, call,” he concluded.

Adams acknowledged the approach would result in unnecessary calls to the SIU, but he said the public would have more confidence in a decision not to investigate if it was made by an independent body. And while the SIU has the reputation amongst many police services for unfathomably long investigations, it does have the ability to examine an incident and decide not to pursue a full-fledged probe — a process called “closed by memo”. This allows the watchdog to at first scrutinize a death, injury or allegation, then decide no probe is needed. This has occurred, for example, in deaths involving an officer administering naloxone. On average, those investigations have been terminated in less than one month. The SIU can also quickly decide not to investigate — as recently happened in the case of Roopesh Rajkumar, the father alleged to have killed his 11-year-old daughter, Riya, after it was discovered he had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound before OPP officers arrested him (he later died). Under the proposed legislation, it’s likely the watchdog will no longer be called. Though welcomed by police associations this week, the change presents a slippery slope, says Kingsley Gilliam, a founding member of the Black Action Defence Committee (BADC), whose advocacy in the 1980s was a catalyst for the creation of the SIU. The group protested in the streets precisely because they did not want police making the determination on when an investigation was warranted. “Which police officer is going to squeal on his partner to say that he committed a criminal act?” he asked. Issue No. 2 — Suspension without pay What it is: Determining when Ontario’s police chiefs can suspend an officer without pay when he or she is facing criminal charges or serious misconduct allegations. Ontario is the only province in Canada that requires, by law, that an officer must be paid while suspended unless they are sentenced to jail time. Has it changed from the Liberals’ bill? No. Similar to Bill 175, the proposed COPS Act would allow for a few more circumstances in which an officer might be suspended without pay, including for convictions for an offence, even if it’s under appeal, or when an officer is charged with certain serious offences, to be determined in future regulations.

Why it matters: The ability for chiefs to suspend more officers without pay has been called upon for years, foremost by the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP). The province’s strict stance is widely perceived as both a waste of tax money and, too often, an embarrassment. A few high-profile cases have exposed how officers facing serious allegations have continued to collect a large salary for years. In 2015, a Waterloo Regional Police officer made headlines with a mocking email in which he thanked his service for the perks of his three-year paid suspension — a “dream come true” which included golf, travel and the ability to take a firefighter course. In another case, former Toronto Police Const. Ioan Floria was paid while suspended for 11 years before he was fired last year. Jeff McGuire, executive director of the OACP, said earlier this week that police chiefs did not see what they wanted in the proposed legislation. “It’s not something we relish or look forward to doing,” McGuire said, “but as the managers of the service there are times when, in our opinion, we should have the authority to suspend without pay. And it is very limited right now.” Issue No. 3 — SIU transparency requirements What it is: Requiring that the SIU provide greater details about its decisions to not lay any charges against the police. This would ideally come in the form of a publicly available report, complete with relevant photos, videos, a narrative of the incident and detailed account of how the SIU came to its decision.

Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? No. This is was a central tenet of the Liberals’ Safer Ontario Act, and its virtually ‘copy-pasted’ into the COPS legislation, though the PC bill does add that “any delays” in the investigation be noted in the required timeline. Why it matters: Up until the high-profile death of Andrew Loku, a Black mentally ill man killed by Toronto police in 2015, the SIU provided limited explanation of its decisions, via a press release announcing whether an officer would be charged. In his 2017 review of police oversight in Ontario, Justice Michael Tulloch had a laser-focus on transparency, and one of his key recommendations was that the agency become “more open, candid, and communicative,” including by releasing detailed public reports “in every case in which it does not lay charges.” He noted there was an “overwhelming need for greater transparency.” The SIU has since adopted a practice of providing far more extensive reports on some cases where no charge is laid, including fatal police use of force. The COPS Act, however, will make this reporting required by law, as the Liberals’ bill would have accomplished. “I’m pleased they kept it in — I’m surprised they kept it in,” said Sandy Hudson, one of the founding members of Black Lives Matter Toronto, which demanded the release of far more information about Loku’s shooting death and all other SIU investigations. “We fought a lot for transparency. It’s something that we need in order to actually understand what is happening in our communities,” she said. She added, however, that the provision of requiring more information is undercut by giving police “far more discretion on when they call the SIU” due to the changes to notification requirements.

Issue No. 4 — Public complaints about police What it is: Revamping Ontario’s independent police complaints agency. Currently, complaints about the police in Ontario can be filed with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD). Established in 2008, the office accepts and screens complaints about police across Ontario, determining whether further investigation is required. If so, the agency either assigns one of its own investigators to the case, or refers it back to the police service in question. The OIPRD also conducts systemic reviews to tackle larger issues within policing in the province. Late last year, the agency wrapped a major probe into the Thunder Bay Police Service’s handling of cases involving deaths or disappearances of Indigenous people. Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes. The PC legislation acts on a Tulloch recommendation to rename the organization, whose unwieldy title and acronym confuse citizens and police alike. Under COPS, the OIPRD would become the Law Enforcement Complaints Agency (LECA), its mandate would include some special constables and peace officers, and it would retain the ability to launch systemic investigations. Similar to how the complaints body works now, the proposed LECA would receive complaints then either investigate in house, or assign a probe to a police service, including the service where the complaint originated. That’s a departure from Bill 175’s proposed “Ontario Policing Complaints Agency” — the Liberals had demanded that, within a five-year period the agency be fully independent, no longer referring complaints out. Why it matters: As noted in Tulloch’s report, the vast majority of public complaints brought to the OIPRD are referred back to the police service for investigation, which he concluded “erodes public confidence in the complaints process.” During his broad public consultation, the judge found a “deep mistrust of the public complaints process,” and the referral back to police services was “seen as a major impediment to a good-faith and impartial investigation.” Gilliam, from BADC, had lauded recent efforts to make the complaints system fully independent.

“That’s a retrograde move there,” said of the PC’s proposed complaints body, noting the Liberals’ bill would have meant “some semblance of confidence could be restored.” “This is a setback,” he said. Issue No. 5 — SIU power to charge civilians What it is: Determining whether the SIU should be allowed to investigate and charge non-police officers. Currently, the SIU can investigate and charge a civilian, even though its core mandate is to probe the actions of police officers. They can do so if the civilian is involved in alleged criminal activity alongside a police officer. The situation is exceedingly rare, but the watchdog did charge a civilian in 2017: Christian Theriault, who alongside his Toronto police officer brother Michael Theriault, is alleged to have assaulted Dafonte Miller in a high-profile incident in late 2016. Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes. Bill 175 had provided for the watchdog to continue to be able to investigate a civilian under certain circumstances. The PC bill removes that power. “Police would still be able to investigate in such situations, allowing the SIU to concentrate on its core mandate,” according to Ontario government backgrounder. Why it matters: In the case of the Theriault brothers — who are set to go to trial later this year — the incident was the subject of widespread public outrage, with members of the public and Miller’s lawyer Julian Falconer alleging there had been the “deliberate concealment” of a crime. That’s because the SIU had not been called in to investigate the circumstances surrounding Miller’s severe injuries, including damage to his eye, following an encounter with the Theriault brothers in Whitby; neither Toronto police, who employ Michael Theriault, nor the Durham Regional Police Service, where the incident occurred, notified the watchdog. As pointed out by Falconer and others, the Theriault brothers’ father was employed at the time in the Toronto police professional standards unit. Under the proposed PC system, the investigation into Christian Theriault would have instead been taken over by police, which Toronto lawyer Daniel Brown says would not inspire confidence, given the perception of bias in the case. He says though they are uncommon, there may be other instances where the SIU should be allowed to investigate and charge a civilian in order to ensure public confidence in the probe. “These instances are rare, but given that, why are we so worried about the SIU investigating them?” Wendy Gillis is a Toronto-based reporter covering crime and policing.

Here, from","Mark is at the Oncenter in Syracuse, New York with the great Dennis Miller tonight, so, in lieu of his Saturday movie column and with tomorrow's Academy Awards looming, we thought we'd take a look back at some Steyn Oscar columns of the past. Here, from his Spectator review of twenty years ago, are Mark's thoughts on the 1999 ceremony:

Around the time of his fiftieth birthday, when he was having a little difficulty attracting A-list celebrities, President Clinton opined wistfully to a friend that it would be nice to go to a gala in his honour that wasn't hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. After Sunday's Oscars ceremony, we all know how he feels. I thought she'd have difficulty improving on her last gig three years ago, when after hearing ""Colours Of The Wind"", the overwrought eco-ballad from Pocahontas, she mused that she'd always wondered about the colour of her wind. On the evidence of her tacky commentary on Sunday night, the colour would seem to be grey: it wasn't just windy, it was stale and flat and hung in the air. If you're going to get into the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" gags a year late, you have to do better than Whoopi's dull quips about A Bug's Life being ""The Linda Tripp Story"". It was a timely reminder that lazy mainstream Hollywood easy-listening liberalism is somehow even more irritating than those unreconstructed Stalinist fellow travellers outside the hall demanding Elia Kazan apologise. Come back, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Bob Hope, anyone.

The awards themselves, as distinct from the show, were more interesting. Academy voters, for whatever reasons, had chosen to reject precisely the kind of film that, come Oscar time, Hollywood likes best: commercial pap with aspirations. It seems only yesterday that American critics were hailing The Truman Show as surefire Oscar material: who now even remembers it? In the end - that's to say, the final award of the evening - the same fate befell even Saving Private Ryan. The Academy was always going to have a hard job resisting Roberto Benigni, but I felt sorry for Best Actor nominee Ian McKellen, who gives a lovely performance in Gods and Monsters that's as good as anything he's ever done - better even. The villain roles, from Richard III down, can by their very nature never quite tap into that distinctive softness, gentleness of McKellen. This film does, in a way we've never seen before.

He's playing James Whale, the once famous director of Frankenstein (the 1931 Boris Karloff version, still the best), The Invisible Man (the 1933 Claude Rains version, also the best) and Show Boat (the 1936 Helen Morgan/Irene Dunne/Paul Robeson version, likewise). On 29 May 1957, Whale wound up at the bottom of his pool 'in mysterious circumstances', an obscure Gloria Swanson type reduced to playing his own William Holden. And there he lay, more or less, until a 1995 book by Christopher Bram, Father of Frankenstein. To the dying embers of Whale's reputation, Bram served as, er, stoker, and this film is one of the happy results. Most of the events depicted here are fictitious, but Bill Condon directs with a droll, precise command that is as much a tribute to Whale as anything else. We are in the last months of his life, and Whale has time on his hands and, indeed, on his eyelids and in his consonants: to listen to the way McKellen's Whale lingers over his own name 'Hhwwwhhhale' - is to understand the sprawling emptiness of his days. After 1941, he made just one film - a 40-minute adaptation of a William Saroyan play that was never released: this is a man who has had all the time in the world to perfect every detail of an empty existence - or, as Whale puts it, in a line whose delivery ought to have earned the actor an Oscar all by itself, ""My pyjamas are all tailored.""

McKellen holds the picture together with a kind of enervated panache and, even when the surrounding campery gets out of whack, he never does. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe the title, which I'll bet is one reason why it didn't do as well at the US box-office and at the Oscars as it should have. Father of Frankenstein was much better.

As for Elia Kazan that night two decades ago, Steyn wrote in Mark Steyn's Passing Parade:

Kazan can make a claim to be the father of modern American acting, having brought Stanislavskian techniques to Broadway and then to film through Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Rod Steiger. He was the best theater director of the forties and fifties, and later a fine novelist, and when he walked onstage in 1999 to receive a belated Lifetime Achievement Oscar, he might reasonably have expected the orchestra to be vamping Leonard Bernstein's theme to On the Waterfront for a good ten minutes while Hollywood roared its appreciation. Instead, outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion elderly hack screenwriters led protests, and inside, the likes of Sean Penn sat on their hands. For both Hollywood's ancient D-list Communists and its A-list anti-anti-Communists, there's only one thing about Kazan that matters: he ""named names..."" As the former blacklisted screenwriter Norma Barzman told CNN, ""Elia Kazan's lifetime achievement is great films and destroyed lives, and even a third thing, which is a lasting climate of fear over Hollywood and maybe over the country...""

At gatherings in the arts it's boorish and tedious to become too exercised about communism—no matter how many faraway, foreign, unglamorous people it kills. Elia Kazan was on the right side of history. His enemies line up with the apologists for thugs and tyrants. Whose reputation would you bet on in the long run?

And here's Mark's Spectator column five years later on the 2004 Oscars, the year of Tolkien:

It was a night of triumph for British film. Well, okay, it wasn't. ""UK Overlooked By Oscar Voters"" was the BBC headline. ""Whatever Happened To The Brit Pack?"" wondered The Scotsman. ""Ring Of Failure,"" declared a gloomy Birmingham Post, waking up to the bleak realization that the only Tolkien tourism boom was going to be the stampede to New Zealand to see the actual Shire where the great Kiwi author wrote his famous fantasy.

So it was a crummy night for British film. But it was a great night for British Commonwealth film – New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, even Britain (the one-third of the Best Song written by Annie Lennox, plus make-up man Peter King and set designer Alan Lee, all three sharing in the Hobbit spoils); even my own decayed Dominion picked up Best Foreign-Language Film for Les Invasions Barbares. If the Eurocentric UK press weren't so parochial, it would hail the Oscars as a grand triumph for what the Queen calls ""our Commonwealth family"": if you were a nominee who had the good fortune to be a subject of the Crown, you had a much better chance of taking home a statuette than those poor souls cursed to be free-born citizens of the United States.

Indeed, the Oscars are a much better – or, at any rate, less feeble - advertisement for the Imperial family than the Commonwealth Conference. If I were Her Majesty, I'd make it the theme of this year's Christmas message: start with one of those sappy Oscar-intro things about movies bringing the world together to sit in the dark and dare to dream our dreams, blah, blah, and then put her next to an Alberta key grip and a New South Wales gaffer showing her how to grip and gaff (""Really? How interesting"") and end with her asking Charlize Theron's mum about the night she shot Charlize's dad (""Really? How interesting"").

Billy Crystal had some cute cracks about down under: ""It's official,"" he announced halfway through the night. ""There's now no-one left to thank in New Zealand."" But an opening reference to the Great White North was more pointed: ""All of Hollywood is here. It's like the Canadian Oscars."" Hollywood is the only place on the planet frightened of Canada. New Zealand is still an exotic, remote location, but Vancouver and Montreal are the default backlot. When Clint Eastwood insisted Mystic River, set in Boston, actually be filmed in Boston, it was considered as radical a move as when Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen insisted on filming On The Town in New York. In those days, if they wanted Manhattan or the mid-west or the Rockies or darkest Africa they built a set. Now they just do it in Canada: ""New York"" is Toronto, ""Philadelphia"" is Calgary... The film unions, from the carpenters to the bit-players, are sick of it.

On the campaign trail, John Kerry keeps hammering corporations about ""outsourcing"" and ""exporting"" American jobs. But you'd be hard put to find as outsourced an industry as Hollywood, except maybe children's toys. The only difference is that, unlike the toy makers, the guys making the big decisions at head office in LA seem to have forgotten the basic business rule: KYC – Know Your Customers. All last week, Oscar types were whining that Mel Gibson was stealing their buzz. That's true to the extent that it was a buzz-less Oscars, and on the big night even the frocks were dull, with a pronounced lack of cleavage, save for game gals of a certain age like Jamie Lee Curtis and Susan Sarandon. But the buzz about Mel's movie came from the Hollywooden liberals in the big media who've spent the best part of a year warning that The Passion Of The Christ was going to be the biggest thing on the anti-semitic scene since The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion. All those liberal columnists who champion the necessity of brave transgressive artists when it comes to giving us a horny Jesus (The Last Temptation Of Christ), a gay Jesus (the Broadway play Corpus Christi) or a Jesus floating in the artist's urine (Piss Christ) have finally discovered a Jesus it would be grossly irresponsible to show to the public.

But what's really hilarious is Hollywood's failure to get The Passion Of The Christ as a business proposition. Until a month ago, the standard line from the studio execs was that Mel Gibson had blown well over 30 million bucks of his own money on a vanity project for him and and a handful of other Jesus freaks. Last week, it racked up the biggest mid-week opening – not just of any film in Aramaic but of any non-sequel movie ever; the only bigger opening gross was for The Return Of The King. Now the new rap on Mel is that he claims to be a Christian but he's making gazillions off his Saviour's suffering. Well, one reason he's making so much is because he doesn't have to share it with any of the big Hollywood muscle who were convinced the fundamentalist weirdo was out of his tree. Unlike all that Miramax pseudo-art-house stuff, The Passion is a genuine independent film: the system wasn't interested, so Mel bypassed it, and he's cleaning up.

How did they get it so wrong? Until 40 years ago, religious movies were a staple of Hollywood. The audience didn't change, Hollywood did. A couple of years back, I was at a conference at Paramount on American values and someone asked why they didn't make more religious pictures. Carmine Zozsora, producer of the Die Hard movies, replied in all seriousness: ""Well, we tried that with The Last Temptation Of Christ, and it didn't work out too well.""

That's the reality behind all that Oscar-night blather about how movies bind us together in stories of our common humanity, etc, etc. In fact, Hollywood defines our common humanity ever more narrowly. Nobody was in the mood for big anti-Bush speeches on Sunday night, and even Sean Penn contented himself with a mere subordinate clause about how actors had known there were no WMDs. But that's all you need. Like Billy Crystal's crack about Bush's National Guard service, it's the celebrity equivalent of a Masonic handshake – a way of signaling that you're in the club. But the club excludes too many people, and, if it carries on like that, the movie biz will be in as much trouble as the music biz.

That's not my main rap against Sean Penn, of course. Bill Murray was not only robbed but weirdly humiliated in his loss by Billy Crystal. As I said in my review, as you watch Mystic River Penn and Tim Robbins seem to be ""furiously tap-dancing for Oscar votes."" More fool the Academy for falling for it.

In Anchorage, emotionally preparing students for the scary prospect of climate change

The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development is in the process of revamping its science standards. It hopes to have a draft released by March. But for the past 13 years, teachers have been working with a curriculum that gives little guidance on how to explain the science behind one of Alaskas most pressing problems: climate change.

This week, were going inside two Alaska classrooms to learn how teachers and students are navigating these difficult conversations.

Bryan Smith is the kind of teacher who goes by his first name in his classroom at Polaris K-12 School in Anchorage. You could call his teaching style eclectic.

Today, his class of high school students are learning about resource extraction by competing to grab Goldfish crackers off of a row of tables. Snatch too many goldfish and you deplete the fishery.

As soon as I saw people taking more than three fish, I knew it was over for me, Kadi LeBlanc, a ninth-grader, said with a laugh.

She says not everyone is playing fair. But she understands the point.

If people are greedy and take more than an ecosystem can handle, by the end no one be able to use that resource, LeBlanc said. Itll be gone.

Later, the class brainstorms helpful values for solving the problem. They list things like communication, planning and following rules or regulations.

It sounds like students are having a good time. But Bryan acknowledges these are tough things to talk about, especially in a resource-dependent state.

Ive got this Upton Sinclair quote above my door: Its difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it, Bryan said.

That quote alludes to the tightrope discussions Bryan has to have with his students. Some of their parents are employed by the oil and gas industry. Bryan says it can be a sensitive topic; the business thats feeding some families is also contributing to an increase in carbon emissions.

So there are the social complexities of teaching about climate change in an oil state, and then there are the emotional ones.

One of the reasons why I suspect other teachers might not want to jump into this, besides it being a political hot topic its heavy and its a real downer, Bryan said.

Bryan says the future can appear increasingly uncertain, dangerous and even scary for kids.

He describes it as taking an unblinking look into the void. Alaska is warming twice as fast as the global average temperature.

So the students in his classroom are given a choice.

And this is where Bryan takes another page from one of the great contemporary works: The Matrix.

He uses an iconic scene from the dystopian sci-fi thriller in class. In the movie, Morpheus tells the protagonist Neo that theres no turning back.

You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe, Morpheus explains. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Bryan says he has had one student tell a counselor, I dont want want to take this class.

Of course, Bryans not presenting his class of middle and high school students with real pharmaceuticals. Its a metaphor. Take the blue pill and drop the elective science class. Or, take the red pill and learn more about the leading causes of climate change and its effects.

Bryan believes the student who opted out felt like the subject was just too much to handle, and he says thats OK. He wants his classroom to be intellectually and emotionally prepared for the things theyre about to hear.

The projections are grim, Bryan said. Thats why in the past couple of decades scientists have started speaking out publicly.

Bryan admits hes struggled to explain this to his own kids, who are 11 and 14 years old. He feels conflicted, like hes stealing away a piece of their childhood by telling them the truth.

The concern is somewhat valid. The states former Department of Health and Social Services commissioner even put out a report warning about increased anxiety and depression as Alaskans grapple with a changing environment.

Some of Bryans younger students have asked him to dial it back.

They were kids, and they just wanted to go play on the swings and thats fine, he said.

But like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix, if a student is ready, Bryan wants to them have all the information: Climate change is happening. The future, as projected, looks pretty bleak. Our carbon emissions are a major contributing factor.

But he assures them there are things they can do. The antidote to despair is action, he says.

Still, Bryan has received some push back from at least one of the teens in his class.

It was for an assignment where he asked students to engage in some kind of activity, applying their values to what they learned. So a student made a flyer for an Anchorage neighborhood.

The gist of it was climate change wasnt happening, Bryan said.

But he didnt fail that student because he completed the assignment and applied his values to the task. Unlike carbon emissions, beliefs can be harder to measure.

Some people you wont be able to reach, Bryan said.

But that was one isolated event over the course of seven years of teaching about climate change.

Bryan says most of his students know its occurring, and they genuinely want to do something about it.

Whats the biggest takeaway he wants his classroom to leave with? After a pause, he says he wants them to feel empowered to take some action, whatever that means to them, and then stop thinking about the rabbit hole. Go out and enjoy the sunshine.

Of course, when people are starving, they’ll resort to killing and eating weak humans. I’m guessing that’s not in his lesson plan, nor is for the libs to stop procreating.

Crackers don’t reproduce; fish do. That said, it is possible to over fish some species in some areas. It is happening to the menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay. But what has that got to do with ‘climate change’? And, frankly, if climate change were to bring warming to Alaska, it would be to that state’s benefit. Huge areas which are now virtually uninhabitable by humans would become viable.

Will humans ever wake up? Quite a few already have, but those are the ones you very seldom hear about, and in anticipation of what may be coming down the pike, have built underground Safe location or are moving to what they believe will be fairly safe areas on planet Earth. At least this is what they believe may (or may not) safe their hide. Only time will tell. As we look around worldwide we find events such as too hot in one area, unseasonably cold in another, along with floods, draughts, more destructive and frequent earthquakes as well as volcanic eruptions. Someone in a motorboat going down an avenue in Kuwait City, while they are trying to get rid of locusts and bugs in Mecca. And there are many, many, many more of such unusual events, too numerous to mention them all here, and the biggest share completely unrelated to any human endeavors. Each event considered individually may easily construed to be an aberration, just what you may think by looking at the individual paint strokes of a picture, but looking at the overall and whole picture worldwide, the idea may sink in that there are forces at work way beyond our control.

Unfortunately this is just the prelude of THINGS TO COME unrelated to human endeavors, even so ignorant and dumb politicians including many so called scientists are attempting to tell us otherwise. Passing it off as global warming and since this did take off like a lead balloon, more recently referring to it as CLIMATE CHANGE which of course is true up to a point, as climate does change from one day to the next, yet it does not address the real causes, the two forces most likely in play are complex and completely unrelated to any human endeavors or activities. The most recent but not the only cause for Earths unusual behavior is another GSM or Grand Solar Minimum with the last one, the Maunder Minimum taking place from 1645 to 1715 and the other joining in is the BEGINNING or re-occurrence (repetition) of the 3600 year signature cycle. Having both running concurrent does not bode well for smooth sailing. There is also a good possibility that this re-occurring 3600 signature cycle may also have ushered in or triggered this new GMS cycle of our sun, in the same manner as it has triggered some unusual behavior amongst some of the other planets in our solar system. This 3600 signature cycle is the same cycle which ushered in the TEN PLAGUES and gave the then Egyptian Pharaoh, most likely Thutmose an Excedrin headache. Eventually being document and recorded as the biblical stories of the TEN PLAGUES followed by the EXODUS. Those were worldwide events not just limited to ancient Egypt as by checking historic accounts of ancient China we find that they were plagued by very similar events, such as unseasonable heat or cold spells, along with storms, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Anyone who has been paying attention to what is going on a worldwide scale, aside from humans getting into each others hair and attempting to kill each other; one would think it would ring a bell! But has it? As stated earlier, so far by living in the Midwest we have gotten by relatively easy and unscathed. Let us hope it will continue.

I experienced this BS school scare tactics back around ‘71 when I was in school. They told us “by year 2000 we would be in a frozen wasteland, the earth would be so polluted and unable to produce food, we would become cannibals. Everyone would die at 40. The earth would be so over populated, everyone would be crammed in tiny shacks and would starve.” They should have all been thrown in prison for mentally abusing little kids and attempting to scare them. But most of us guys pretty much claimed, even at 12 years old, this is “bull shit”.

I’ve been posting this because the study this guy (Patterson) did was put down EARTH TO COOL DOWN WARNS GEO SCIENTIST

2007 The US MAT.Com Scientific reports from Canada and Greenland has indicated that the the shrinking arctic ice sheets have begun to replace themselves rapidly. Strongly suggesting the earth instead of warming, is beginning to cool down. It is still not known (or proven) if this is the result because of the reduced rate of sun spot activity. Canadian geo scientist Professor R. Timothy Patterson of Carelton University is urging a go-slow on the rush for governments to Play God with global warming legislative blaming this on CO2 (carbon dioxide) discharges. Legislating corrections attempting to control a natural cyclic occurrence caused by; sun spots, the magnetic solar wind, and cyclic earth magnetic polarity reversal, among other natural occurrences including volcanism, meteors etc. Probably plays a very significant role in climate change. Yet ignorantly blaming man made CO2 emissions for climatic change. which is becoming a rapidly discredited and minuscule cause of global warming in his article published by Canadas Financial Post. 6/20/07 Patterson was selected by the Canadian government to study the fluctuations in certain types of fish populations.

While doing so the Canadian Geo-Scientist found a correlation when certain species of fish had high population and then drastic drop offs. He discovered these fluctuations corresponded with sun spot activity and solar radiation vs cosmic activity. When earth cooling occurred. Studying deep fjords along the Western Canadian coast where deep pools of low oxidation water exist. The Patterson study reached deep into the earths recent past of 4000 years of undisturbed sediments. Patterson found that when aquatic activity was highest and lowest in those collected sediments having high aquatic content had matched known solar protection when the magnetic wind was highest, and dropped off when earth magnetic fields activities were lowest.Thus causing cosmic radiation to intensify. Then because the earth became unprotected by its magnetic fields from galactic cosmic activity. Patterson cites several accepted theories which concludes this then created cloud activity during such periods which increased drastically. Thus cooling earth and bringing in its ice ages. In his presentation here is a professor urging more scientific study (like Pope Benedict)is needed. That politicians including Al Gore, of The Earth Is Flat Society, dont know what the hell theyre talking about. Strongly suggesting that the global warming may be caused by exhaling politicos rather than serious scientific examination. Patterson seems to be saying before Canadians start investing in palm trees they should be considering better parkas because what goes up must come down and the Mexicans better move over for a reverse population flow. The story was featured in The Drudge Report, and World Net Daily, which were linked in The US Mats last page. But lost due to source link changes . http://www.theusmat.com/index.htm

395,Empty,2019-02-25T22:07:09Z,Wilson-Raybould said she still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued an official cabinet order to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The cabinet order, called an order-in-council, was published Monday evening, and comes on the same day Wilson-Raybould released a letter saying she needs more clarity on the constraints on her speech before she’ll schedule an appearance at the House of Commons justice committee.

The committee has invited Wilson-Raybould to testify about her version of events about the allegation, published in the Globe and Mail, that she was politically pressured to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order allows Wilson-Raybould and “any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin” to disclose to the justice committee information about discussions on that subject that are covered by cabinet confidences or solicitor-client privilege.

It also allows those people to disclose the information to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, who is also conducting an investigation into the matter.

Cabinet confidence privilege protects information that is the subject of discussion at cabinet meetings or between cabinet ministers. Solicitor-client privilege protects information that is given by the government’s legal advisor.

“However, in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings, this authorization and waiver does not extend to any information or communications between the former Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin,” the order says.

Trudeau had given a vague promise earlier on Monday that he would allow Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about “relevant matters.”

Wilson-Raybould’s letter to the justice committee — revealed Monday afternoon — said these issues need more attention before she’ll agree to testify.

“I am anxious to appear at the first available time,” she said in the letter dated Feb. 25. “However, I believe that in advance of my appearance, the Members of the Committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.”

She said she has taken legal advice, but still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed without violating the Parliamentary convention that it not interfere with ongoing court matters.

“I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues,” she said.

I am anxious to appear at the first available time

Wilson-Raybould said that when she does appear, she would like 30 minutes for an opening statement to give her recollection of events, and then would stay and answer questions for as long as the committee wants.

SNC-Lavalin is facing criminal charges for allegedly bribing public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011. It has also filed a case in Federal Court that challenges the decision made by federal prosecutors last September to not negotiate a remediation agreement. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

The political controversy centres on whether Wilson-Raybould, when she was justice minister and attorney general, was pressured by Trudeau or his senior staff to order federal prosecutors to stay the corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and instead pursue a remediation agreement. It is a Canadian constitutional principle that attorneys general must not be pressured politically when acting in their role of overseeing the federal prosecution service.

The Commons justice committee started its study of the matter last week, and heard a fiery defence of the government’s side from Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council.

Despite Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about solicitor-client privilege, Wernick told the committee he doesn’t see any privilege around the conversations. “I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,” he said. “The matter was never discussed at cabinet, ever. So she was not giving advice to cabinet. She was not advising the prime minister.”

Wernick predicted that Wilson-Raybould will raise concerns about three meetings, including a phone call he had with her on Dec. 19, 2018 — just weeks before she was shuffled out of the justice minister role.

He told the committee he was confident that all the conversations were “lawful.” Yet he also said that in his conversation with her, he told Wilson-Raybould that “a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.”

The Conservatives sought to turn up the pressure on Trudeau by calling on him to testify at the justice committee. On Monday they introduced a motion that, citing Trudeau’s “alleged direct involvement” in pressuring Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin case, called on him to “to appear, testify and answer questions at the (justice committee), under oath, for a televised, two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019.”

The Liberals used their majority to defeat the motion on Monday evening by a vote of 155 to 106.

Earlier Monday the justice committee heard testimony from lawyers and law professors with expertise on remediation agreements and the role of attorneys-general in government.

UBC law professor Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge, said that once prosecutors have reached the “decision point” to proceed with a trial, she is skeptical government officials having any legal basis for raising it with the attorney general.

“There is limited lawful authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point, and going forward,” she told the committee.

Turpel-Lafond said it’s fine for government officials to offer their assistance if the attorney general wants more information, but that’s where the limit lies.

“I think when we get beyond that position of the more passive and respectful approach, and we get into a very rigorous position of saying, ‘I challenge you to take a different position,’ I think we are into very serious issues with the rule of law,” she said.

Democracy Watch, a Canadian advocacy group, believes Trudeau broke two sections of the Conflict of Interest Act by failing to abstain from a vote held last week in the House of Commons over whether or not to hold a public inquiry into the growing scandal. The Liberals defeated the motion with 159 against and 133 in favour.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould did the right thing by abstaining,” Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, told the Sun. “Democracy Watch will soon file a complaint with the Ethics Commissioner about Trudeau’s vote.”

If Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion takes on the case, this would be in addition to the investigation he is already undertaking in response to complaints by the NDP about the broader concerns around political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The first section Democracy Watch believes Trudeau violated, subsection 6(2), states that: “No minister of the Crown, minister of state or parliamentary secretary shall, in his or her capacity as a member of the Senate or the House of Commons, debate or vote on a question that would place him or her in a conflict of interest.”

The second, section 21, states: “A public office holder shall recuse himself or herself from any discussion, decision, debate or vote on any matter in respect of which he or she would be in a conflict of interest.”

If found guilty, it would not be the first time for Trudeau. In December 2017, Trudeau became the first sitting prime minister to have been found guilty of breaking federal conflict of interest rules, in relation to his Bahamas vacation to the Aga Khan’s island.",Watchdog filing ethics complaint against Trudeau for voting against public inquiry,Torontosun.com,https://torontosun.com/news/national/watchdog-files-ethics-complaint-against-trudeau-for-voting-against-public-inquiry

Congratulations if you had “Canada’s top civil servant rides to Justin Trudeau‘s rescue against Jody Wilson-Raybould” on your SNC-Lavalin Bingo cards.

Appearing before the justice committee, Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick said there was nothing to the idea that when Wilson-Raybould was Canada’s attorney general the PMO tried to pressure her into helping SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and corruption. “At every opportunity, verbally and in writing in December, the prime minister made it clear that this was the decision for the minister of justice to take. She was the decision-maker,” he declared. He blasted the Globe and Mail story that first raised the allegations of political interference, saying it “contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory.” And he praised Trudeau and his staff for their integrity: “You may not like their politics or their policies or their tweets but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing, in their own view, in the right way.” (Canadian Press)

Wernick also used his testimony to go well beyond the question of political interference in the SNC-Lavalin case, warning darkly that “somebody’s going to be shot” during the next Federal election campaign, that “trolling from the vomitorium of social media” was making its way into the “open media arena”, and without naming him he singled out Conservative Sen. David Tkachuk who urged the yellow-vested convoyers who descended on the Hill this week to get in their trucks and “roll over every Liberal left in the country. Because when they’re gone, these bills are gone.” Wernick called the Senator’s words “totally unacceptable,” given the Toronto van attack, and said “I hope that you as parliamentarians are going to condemn that.”

Incidentally, Conservatives who fell into fits earlier this month when Liberal MP Adam Vaughan extended a whack-a-mole analogy to suggest someone should “whack” Ontario Premier Doug Ford—whack being what the mobsters say when they kill someone, in case you didn’t know—have been silent on the Conservative Senator’s call for truckers to drive around the country ploughing down Liberals. Candice Bergen, we’re looking at you.

Also, fun fact: no one has ever used the word “vomitorium” on the Hill before, according to Hansard and the Library of Parliament.

Wernick’s statement was overtly political, coming from a civil servant, which didn’t go unnoticed. “Fine. I’ll just say it. Parts of this performance are why politicians like Stephen Harper can plausibly argue the Canadian Public Service is the Liberal Public Service,” tweeted constitutional scholar Emmett Macfarlane. “Some of the Clerk’s comments today amount to cheerleading for the current government.” (Twitter)

John Geddes parses Wernick’s full testimony, which offered “a glimpse inside the way the powerful interact—and evidently sometimes don’t—around Ottawa”:

Then Wernick made the link to how Canadians might process news of Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin. “I think Canadians need to be assured,” he said, “that their police and investigators with the powers of the state operate independently, and that the prosecution services—the state charging people with offences—are completely independent.” He stressed repeatedly that even though SNC-Lavalin had aggressively lobbied the federal government, the company never did manage to get the remediation agreement it so badly wanted. Wernick was eager to put on the record the fact that he personally refused to meet with the company more often than he agreed, and even walked out of a National Arts Centre gala last Oct. 3—an event headlined by pop singer Diana Ross—to avoid proximity to SNC-Lavalin executives.

Every time Justin Trudeau has tried to free himself from the SNC-Lavalin affair with a new explanation, Wilson-Raybould has been there to hem him back in, writes Andrew MacDougall:

To date, there have been several ifs, many ands, and one lost (Gerry) Butts —with no end in sight. And the next cut might just be the deepest: on Monday Jody Wilson-Raybould rolls into Justice Committee looking to “speak her truth”. Trudeau is clearly not in control of events. But somebody is, and that somebody is…Jody Wilson-Raybould. Indeed, when you beam the SNC mess through the Wilson-Raybould lens, everything snaps into focus. As one wag in London said to me the other day: right now, Ottawa has gone all House of Cards because Jody Wilson-Raybould is going all Frank Underwood. (Maclean’s)

Tariffic news: We’re not sure exactly when Canada ceased posing a national security threat to the United States, but apparently we’re a more docile lot now, and the Trump administration is ready to remove the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum that have mostly served to make things more expensive for Americans. Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, said he’s confident the tariffs will be lifted “in the next few weeks” though he hasn’t said why he thinks that. If the tariffs aren’t lifted, Ottawa might just forget to proceed with legislation to implement the USMCA treaty, suggested Transport Minister Marc Garneau: “We will be doing some serious thinking about whether we want to proceed forward with it … you know the situation with respect to steel and aluminum is not yet resolved.” (Global News, CBC News)

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers’ integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de l’immigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers’ applications as the bill is being debated.

“This situation is a catastrophe for us,” said Seeun Park, a nurse and plaintiff in the case who came to Quebec with her two children from South Korea in 2017.

“We already invested a lot of money and efforts end energy to work in Quebec,” she told reporters on Friday outside the courtroom in Montreal.

A spokesman for the province’s immigration minister declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was before the court.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

But he told the West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson he’s taking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at his word and hopes Canadians’ “reasonableness” will prevail.

“Canadians will have to make up their own minds,” said Carr, who the Prime Minister’s Office put up to answer questions on the matter.

“I take the testimony of the Clerk of the Privy Council, who is the chief non-partisan public servant. I take the prime minister’s word that there was no direction, that it was her decision to make. He said so many times and I believe Canadians will — and you have to believe in the reasonableness of Canadians on this.”

WATCH BELOW: Wilson-Raybould’s reasons for stepping down ‘still unclear’ to me, says Trudeau

Wilson-Raybould was Carr’s cabinet colleague up until Feb. 12, when she abruptly resigned.

That came after Trudeau responded to questions about allegations of political interference by appearing to suggest Wilson-Raybould’s continued presence in his cabinet suggested nothing untoward had taken place.

The allegations published in the Globe and Mail on Feb. 7 asserted Wilson-Raybould was pressured by unknown officials in the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the decision of the director of public prosecutions not to offer an untested legal option called a “remediation agreement” to SNC-Lavalin.

A remediation agreement, created by the Liberals just last year, would have allowed a company to admit wrongdoing, face a fine, and avoid a criminal trial and a potential guilty verdict and a decade-long ban on bidding for lucrative government contracts.

Such a ban could have also had a heavy hit on the Montreal company’s bottom line and the thousands of jobs in an election year.

Trudeau initially said the report of pressure being applied was “false” and that he never “directed” her to take any specific decision.

The government line has evolved from that over the past three weeks, with officials later saying there had also been no pressure writ large and that Trudeau had spoken with Wilson-Raybould about the case and told her the decision was “hers alone.”

On Friday, he also offered more details on the considerations involved in conversations on the matter.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters when asked about his conversations with Wilson-Raybould.

Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, told the House of Commons justice committee last week that he also met with Wilson-Raybould after the decision was made not to offer a remediation agreement, and did so in order to “convey consequences.”

WATCH BELOW: Top public servant defends government’s handling of SNC case

He said those “consequences” included the potential loss of Canadian jobs — not threats against her.

When asked whether he believed any inappropriate pressure had been applied, Carr would not say but noted it was Wilson-Raybould who made the ultimate decision not to intervene and order a remediation deal be offered — something the company had lobbied heavily for.

“I believe that she made a decision that was hers to make and it was a decision that everybody is respecting,” Carr said, adding that he does not himself know the specifics of why Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet, which came almost exactly one month after Trudeau moved her from attorney general to the lower-profile position of Minister of Veterans Affairs.

“It wasn’t clear in the letter but she has reasons and she will give those reasons as she sees fit to do,” Carr said.

“She’ll be appearing in front of the justice committee on Tuesday and we will learn in more detail what was in her mind and what motivated her. I think that’s reasonable — the system is working.”

Wilson-Raybould is expected to appear before the House of Commons justice committee conducting a limited probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday.

She has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, saying instead that she believes solicitor-client privilege prevents her from speaking on the matter.

Wernick said he disagrees and that solicitor-client privilege would not apply.

Wilson-Raybould has retained former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to help her decide what she can and cannot discuss publicly.

The OGarden system lets you grow herbs, tomatoes, leafy greens, and more year-round.","If you've always wanted to start your own herb or vegetable garden but don't have the yard space or the ""green thumb"" to pull it off, there's now another option. The OGarden Smart is an indoor gardening system that grows up to 90 plants at one time—20 of which are edible.

Strawberries, celery, kale, bok choy, green beans, cayenne pepper, green onion, and cherry tomatoes are just a few of the fruits and veggies the OGarden can grow. Up to 30 growing cups can be placed in a lower cabinet, where the seeds are allowed to germinate. Once they sprout, the plants can then be transferred to the rotating wheel up above, which holds up to 60 plants at a time. It takes about 30 to 40 days to harvest the produce, depending on the type of plant grown.

The system is self-watering and uses automatic LED lights to provide the right amount of sunlight, no matter what season it is. The only work that's required is planting the seeds and refilling the water tank once a week.

The OGarden Smart is the second product launched by company co-founders Pierre Nibart and Pierre-Etienne Bourget, of Quebec, Canada. The original OGarden debuted in 2017, and the Smart upgrade incorporates a few new features, including automatic watering, automatic LED lighting, and a water warning system. Some reviewers of the original OGarden commented that the system is easy to use, and that the vegetables taste better than store-bought produce.

The OGarden Smart will set you back $859 Canadian dollars (about $650 USD) if you order it on Kickstarter at a discounted rate, but the company's founders are quick to point out that it will help you save money in the long-run. The system lets you grow organic produce at a fraction of the price you'd pay at your local grocery store.

The seven-time Grammy winning fourth season “American Idol” winner isn’t seeking much profit on the property she bought for $1.353 million in 2007, not too long before she hooked up with her Canadian professional ice hockey player husband Mike Fisher, and hasn’t lived in since at least sometime last year. At the end of a manicured cul-de-sac that backs up to the rolling greens of the tony Governors Club, and somewhat curiously described in marketing materials as an “Italian Style Villa,” the 7,083-square-foot, stone accented beige brick mansion, which might more accurately be depicted as a luxurious if otherwise pretty ordinary transitional traditional with a decadently celebrified basement, has four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms over three opulently outfitted floors.

A grand, double-height foyer featuring a curved staircase and herringbone pattern stone tile flooring is open to the formal dining room and steps down to a cavernous living room with oak floorboards, a carved stone fireplace mantel and plush velvet drapes over a double-height stack of windows. With a plethora of up-to-date stainless steel appliances and dark brown granite countertops on elaborately carved custom cabinets, the kitchen opens over a boomerang-shaped island stack bar to a breakfast area and adjoining family room with a beige brick fireplace and golf course view. The residence also offers a library/office, a games room/guest apartment with kitchenette and a mirror-walled gym with black rubber floor mats.

Each of the three guest bedrooms has a private bathroom while the wall-to-wall carpeted main floor master suite offers a fireplace, a spacious bathroom and custom-fitted walk-in closet where a corkscrew staircase winds down to a basement done up as a girlishly glitzy “glam-room” fit for an international music superstar with radiant heated polished marble floors, a hair and makeup station, a shoe and handbag display area and a roomy lounge with wet bar.

Although the house sits on just over half of an acre, outdoor living spaces are limited to a not entirely private veranda outside the family room that overlooks the golf course and a planted courtyard outside the formal living room and master suite that is mostly shielded from view of passing golfers by verdant clumps of trees and foliage.

Sometime after a freaky fall outside the home in late 2017 that left her wrist broken and put dozens of stitches in her face, Underwood and Fisher reportedly decamped Brentwood for a semi-remote spread in nearby Franklin, Tenn., where they took up residence in a rustic-luxe barn-style home on close to 1,000 acres they acquired in a handful of transactions between 2011 and 2016 for a total of about $4 million. The couple have since moved to a rambling, multi-story Cape Cod-style mansion they custom built on the vast country estate where one of their nearest neighbors is veteran country music heavy hitter Wynona Judd.

sum-up of the wedding vibe: A cozy backyard dance party wedding at our favorite neighborhood restaurant.

Planned Budget: $10,000 (CAD)

Actual Budget: $9,500 (CAD)

Number of Guests: 45

Location: Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Where we allocated the most funds:

Our priorities for the wedding were good food, good music, good dancing, and good company, so our budget followed that model. The most funds went to the cost of our dinner, which we knew would be excellent because our venue is our favorite local restaurant. We were able to sit down with Josh, the chef and owner, and chat with him about our dietary restrictions and the atmosphere we wanted for the wedding, and he came up with an amazing meal for us. We also invested in our photography, and we are so glad we did because Sarah was great to work with and we love our photos. A large portion also went on rentals. We used the restaurant itself for the dinner, but our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dance party were all outdoors in the backyard. Given that the wedding was in October, we had no idea what the weather would do, so we made sure to rent a big tent, a dance floor, and a heater just in case. (It poured with rain, so we were grateful for the tent. It was also strangely very warm for October, so we didn’t need the heater. Nevertheless, we were glad to be prepared).

Related Post Is There A Better Way To Do A First Look?

Where we allocated the least funds:

We didn’t put a lot of money into flowers. We didn’t have a wedding party, so we only needed one bouquet and a handful of boutonnières for family. We also didn’t buy arrangements for the tables because Oliver’s mother and one of her friends bought cut flowers and greens from our florist and did a lovely job arranging them for us. We also decorated with seasonal items like pumpkins, which added to the (Canadian) Thanksgiving weekend coziness but without adding a lot of cost. We were lucky enough to be gifted our wine, which Kate’s parents made (and Kate designed the labels), as well as our beer, which was a custom brew by Oliver’s brother Jeremy (who is a German-certified brewmaster) in conjunction with local brewery Chapter II. Our friend Ivy, who is an incredible artist, designer, and illustrator, also generously designed and made our invitations, our friend Keenan, a talented chef, made us a beautiful and delicious cake as a gift, and our friend Dana gifted us her artistic skills on our chalk signs. We were able to do the graphic design for the seating chart, table numbers, and other printed signage ourselves.

What was totally worth it:

The day went by so quickly, and we couldn’t be everywhere at once, so receiving our photos and being able to go through them and experience the day all over again at a more relaxed pace was absolutely wonderful. Sarah, our photographer, has an amazing way of putting people at ease, even those people who don’t usually like being in photos. We were so completely overwhelmed not only at how well the photos turned out, but also by her kindness and the amount of care she puts into her work. We loved working with her so much on our wedding and our engagement photos, and she has become a friend. Our day-of coordinator, Grace, was also incredible. Any time there was a potential problem, she solved it immediately without letting the stress of it even reach us. She is incredibly organized, patient, and great at getting things done right, so she was perfect. She had no problem running around in the rain and getting muddy setting up our venue, which is worth noting! And, of course, she’s a friend too (there’s a pattern here I think!).

What was totally not worth it:

Honestly, not much. The only thing we didn’t end up needing was the heater for the tent because it was unseasonably warm. It was really cold the day before, however, so we were glad to be prepared for whatever weather came our way. We knew we had a small budget throughout the whole process, so we eliminated pretty much all of the expenses that wouldn’t be worth it. For example, we knew we wanted to do a donation to a charity instead of wedding favors. Because our black cat Winn is such a big part of our lives (yes, we took wedding photos with him, and the portrait our friend Ivy drew of him was hanging at the reception), we decided to donate to the Windsor Essex Humane Society (where we adopted him) instead of doing traditional favors.

A few things that helped us along the way:

Taking eighteen months to plan the wedding from engagement to wedding day was a great decision because it allowed us to take our time, book things well in advance, and keep our budget and priorities straight without too much stress (plus, we got the October wedding Kate wanted). Also, working on it together and not letting one person take on too much work made the process a lot easier and more balanced. We were also lucky to have family who we could ask favors and bounce ideas off, including Kate’s brother and sister-in-law who live nearby. It meant we could sit on their porch when we got stressed or stuck on a decision and get some advice without even leaving the neighborhood.

My best practical advice for my planning self:

Remember that you can’t control everything. Kate is a very organized but anxious person, so when the wedding started approaching, it was hard for her to let go of little details. Giving in to the fact that there were inevitably things out of our control was important but difficult. Don’t be afraid to go against tradition if it does not align with your priorities. Also, don’t check the weather. Ever. The forecast changed about thirty-six times before our wedding day, and there was nothing we could do about it, so it was pointless to check and stress about. Yes, it was freezing the day before while we set up the tent. Yes, we were sweating in the heat the day of the wedding. Yes, there was a massive rain storm in the afternoon. We couldn’t control any of it, we were well-prepared (and Rino’s owner Josh saved the day with some hay for the backyard mud), and luckily the sky cleared up just when we needed it to for our photos, ceremony, and dance party.

Favorite thing about the wedding:

How it became, through design or serendipity, this amazing little neighborhood-focused event. We started counting how many of our vendors were based within a short walking distance of our venue (which is also in the neighborhood where we live), and it was most of them: photographer, DJ, both florists, hairdresser, baker… This really added to the cozy feeling of the wedding along with the fact that we are friends with a lot of our vendors. It made the atmosphere very relaxed and familiar. Some of our vendors even commented on how they felt included and how much they enjoyed knowing some of the guests and other vendors at the wedding. We also loved doing a first look and getting to share that moment together before our family photos. The build up of anticipation throughout the morning and afternoon was exciting, and we really enjoyed the experience of surprising one another. Oh, and our dance party was phenomenal.

We loved that every part of our wedding felt like us. During our planning, it was suggested that we might be focusing on the little details too much, but it was the details that really made the day our own. We chose music that was meaningful to us for our ceremony musicians, we wrote our own secular ceremony to reflect our life together (with a focus on being equal partners and including some serious sappy stuff, but also a couple jokes), we made a dinner playlist with songs that had meaning to us and our guests (including some that we listened to with our families as children), we drew (Oliver) and designed (Kate) table number signs that told the story of different bicycles throughout our relationship (and a pair of roller skates because Kate is a roller-derby skater), and we prioritized the things that meant the most to us without worrying too much about tradition.

We kept it small to share it with our closest family and friends (we both have small families, so that made this easier). We were able to spend time with each and every guest, which was incredibly important to us. And, this was a huge priority for us, we had the most fun dance party I have ever experienced. Our dance floor was packed all night, Jamie, our DJ, was fabulous, and everyone had a really fun time. That’s about all we could ask, so we wouldn’t change a thing. Finally, our wedding hashtag #ourOKwedding got a few laughs. The running joke was that we were turning an OK (Oliver/Kate) romance into a more-than-OK wedding.",Our Cozy $9K Wedding In The Backyard Of Our Favorite Restaurant,Apracticalwedding.com,https://apracticalwedding.com/rinos-kitchen-wedding/

by Egon von Greyerz

Is a total collapse of the financial system next or will we see the globalists taking control of the world? Either way, the world is now at one of the most critical crossroads ever in history. Shakespeare expressed it eloquently in Julius Caesar:

There is a tide in the affairs of men.

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

On such a full sea are we now afloat,

And we must take the current when it serves,

Or lose our ventures.

THE NOT SO BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE WORLD

One of the brightest minds in finance, R.E. McMaster, has summarised the global situation as follows:

“The globalist New World Order could fall apart. First of all, all of the world’s governments today are socialist, a guarantee of failure.

Moreover, debt globally has reached a tipping point (by 2022 at the latest). (A root meaning of the word “debt” is “death”.)

Social Credit Red China could implode from all its excessive reckless debt and imperialistic over-extension.

The un-elected elitist EU is already coming part with Italy, France, the UK, Poland and Hungary in revolt.

The US Empire is self-destructing from military overstretch, bloated debt at all levels, and spoiled, childlike, take-offense-at-everything selfishness by identity groups and welfare recipients squabbling over the loot taken from productive citizens by the government, while billionaire oligarchic-run corporations pick them apart.

Plus, nearly all governments are equally destructive cultural Marxist.

Then there is the instability of the earth’s magnetic poles, its fast weakening magnetic field, the increasing numbers and intensity of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, plus solar instability, not to mention expensive and increasingly scarce energy.

The risk of an internet shutdown.

The risk of a population-exterminating epidemic (likely a virus, man-made), and the risk of a destructive global nuclear war.

Mankind today, at least the mad narcissistic sociopathic and psychopathic Luciferian rulers, seem to have a comprehensive death wish. …”

It is hard to argue against many of these projections. R.E. McMaster is a moderate person with an immaculate 50 year track record.

It is possible that the elite is working hard on their globalist agenda to assume control of the world. If they achieve what they have set out, life on earth will be extremely unpleasant to say the least. Also, there will be nowhere to escape.

A DISORDERLY RESET NEXT

But even the best plans can go badly wrong. The most likely spanner in the works for the elite will be a total collapse of the financial system. This would involve first a final round of money printing creating hyperinflation in most Western countries as well as in emerging markets. But this will have no effect as the world discovers that worthless pieces of paper or computer entries cannot create eternal prosperity.

After a brief hyperinflationary phase, we will see an implosion of the financial system when global debt and liabilities of at least $2 quadrillion currently, disappears into a black hole. As the debt implodes, so will all the bubble assets financed by the debt, including stocks, property and bonds.

So the world is not in the position to take the flood that leads to fortune. Sadly whatever current the world takes will lead to miseries. We are now in a LOSE – LOSE situation and it will be a question of the least painful outcome.

Since the world cannot choose which way to go, we must look at the most likely option. Personally I believe that a collapse of the financial system and the world economy is more likely than globalist control of the world. You could argue that the globalists will orchestrate the collapse and take advantage of the anarchy which will arise to take control. But I think that the coming disorderly reset of the world economy will be impossible to control by any individuals, state or military power.

A GLOBAL FIRE IS REQUIRED

So the coming years and decades will be horrific which ever path the world takes. A reset is totally necessary for the world to start the next growth phase. We need a global fire that burns the current system down to the ground. Only from that position can we get strong green shoots that will form the foundation for a healthy growth of the new world economy.

Michael Snyder recently wrote an article about life in Major Wester Cities called:

“Rats, Public Defecation And Open Drug Use:

Our Major Western Cities Are Becoming Uninhabitable Hellholes”

The advantage with the fire is that it will also destroy the decadence as well as the false values and false morals which have become rampant in the last few decades.

The suffering that we, our children and grandchildren will go through during this period of transition will be horrendous but sadly it will be necessary in order to give the world a chance to eventually take the right current.

DEUS EX MACHINA – THE ONLY SOLUTION?

It is with no pleasure I discuss the above alternatives for the world. I obviously wish that the outcome of the mess we are in now could treat the world more gently. But I cannot see another realistic solution. Possibly that would be Deus ex Machina which I discussed many years ago in an article. This is from the old Greek plays when god was lowered down on the stage in a little machine or basket and solved all the problems. But unfortunately I think that this is a very unlikely solution to the problem we are in.

GOLD ON THE WAY TO NEW HIGHS IN ALL CURRENCIES

So let’s finish with some more uplifting news for the ones who understand the importance of wealth preservation or insurance against the current risks in the world economy and financial system. In my article last week I talked about the Gold Maginot Line. Gold in US dollars has not yet broken the important $1,350 line but is now on its way, finishing at $1,320 last Friday.

Important moves often start in the periphery. As the chart below shows, Gold in Swiss franc for example broke out of the same line last week and is now on its way to new highs.

Gold is now breaking out to new all time highs in a number of currencies including the Swedish and Norwegian Krona, Canadian and Australian dollars and many more. In Venezuela gold was 200 Bolivars in 2000 and now it is 327 million. In Argentina gold was 270 pesos in 2000 and now it is 50,000. We are likely to see these hyperinflationary levels in the West in coming years.

Subscribe

As I discussed in my article last week, the time when gold can be bought at current levels is quickly coming to an end. And we might get to the point when gold, due to shortages, cannot be bought at any level.

Finally, remember that gold is the only currency that has survived in history. A 5,000 year old tradition will not change whatever governments or globalists try to achieve.

Gold is not just a store of value, it is also beautiful. Below are 3 pictures of gold, dating back 4,500 to 6,250 years, from Timothy Green’s book “The Ages of Gold”

The bull below is 6,250 years old. It is a symbol of gold being both timeless and eternal as the only money which has survived throughout history.

Whooping Cough Symptoms What Does Whooping Cough Sound Like? Whooping Cough Diagnosis Whooping Cough Treatments Whooping Cough…,"Coughing fits can be irritating and embarrassing, especially when you're in a public place. There may be instances when you could not control it, but know that coughing is the body's way to get rid of foreign particles or mucus from your lungs.

Commonly caused by viruses, a cough may ease on its own without having to be medicated.1 But when a cough persists or you get a ""whoop"" as you inhale, it may not be a mild cough anymore — it could be that you have whooping cough.

What Is Whooping Cough?

Whooping cough, also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease brought on by the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. Its name was derived from the prolonged and intense coughing fits that produce a whooping sound when inhaling.

A person with pertussis can infect up to 15 people2 when the whooping cough bacteria3 spread from their coughing or sneezing. It generally starts off with cold-like symptoms such as mild fever and occasional cough, but the coughing spells can last for more than two weeks.4

Whooping Cough Causes: How Does It Spread?

As mentioned, the Bordetella pertussis bacterium causes whooping cough. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets of fluid with the bacteria coming from their mouth or nose spread into the air and get inhaled by people close by. When inhaled, the bacteria will reproduce in the cells of the nose and throat. This process generates toxins that inhibit the clearing of airways in the lungs and windpipe.5

A milder illness that's similar to whooping cough is caused by Bordetella parapertussis. Though parapertussis has a shorter duration and is less common,6 both can be fatal when acquired.7,8

Is Whooping Cough Contagious?

Whooping cough is highly contagious and is a common infectious disease in the United States. A recent peak in the number of cases occurred in 2012, with 48,277 reported cases of pertussis,9 although there was a 37 percent decrease in the number from 2014 to 2015.10 The latest report shows 18,975 cases in 2017.11

Outbreaks in day care centers and schools that happen annually12 may have contributed to the significant increase in the number of pertussis cases in 13- to 16-year-olds. But among age groups, the majority of deaths occurred in babies younger than 3 years old.13

How Long Is Whooping Cough Contagious?

Infected people may likely spread the disease during the first stage of the illness, known as the catarrhal stage, and two weeks after the coughing fits start. This is when coughing fits begin to get worse and the ""whooping"" sound is produced.14

Whooping Cough Symptoms You Should Look Out For

Symptoms of whooping cough in adults may be determined through the three stages that an infected person undergoes.15,16

Catarrhal stage — Lasting for one to two weeks, symptoms may include sneezing, occasional cough, runny nose and nasal congestion. In some cases, mild fever may occur.

Lasting for one to two weeks, symptoms may include sneezing, occasional cough, runny nose and nasal congestion. In some cases, mild fever may occur. Paroxysmal stage — The common symptoms are vomiting, exhaustion, bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane, choking and acute coughing. The whooping sound may also be evident in this phase.

The common symptoms are vomiting, exhaustion, bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane, choking and acute coughing. The whooping sound may also be evident in this phase. Convalescent stage — At this point, the prolonged coughing fits become less intense.

Other symptoms of pertussis may include:17

Dehydration

Loss of appetite

Inflammation of the middle ear

In many cases, babies do not cough but they experience apnea, a condition that turns their skin blue and causes their breathing to temporarily stop.18

What Does Whooping Cough Sound Like?

The whooping cough sound may be characterized by a high-pitched ""whoop"" when you breathe in. This sound may be heard after coughing fits during the paroxysmal stage of the disease.19 Not everyone infected with pertussis may produce this sound, though, and some may not even cough, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).20

Whooping Cough Diagnosis

If you have been coughing for 14 days or more, it is important to consult with your health care provider to verify if you have pertussis.21 A number of laboratory tests will determine pertussis including culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology.22 Other tests that you may undergo are blood tests and chest X-rays.23

Whooping Cough Treatments You May Follow

Babies who have been infected by whooping cough may need hospitalization or attentive care from their physician, as this can become a very serious condition for a baby.24 For children and adults, who may not need to be admitted to a hospital, here are lifestyle and home remedies for whooping cough that you may follow:25,26,27,28

• To decrease vomiting, eat small, frequent meals. • Avoid foods that trigger mucus production such as peanuts and wheat. Even healthy foods like raw milk and eggs should be temporarily avoided or minimized while you're suffering from the symptoms. • Consume vitamin C-rich foods such as lime, tangerine, berries, bell pepper and broccoli to boost your immune system. A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal29 found that vitamin C, when taken in substantial doses, may help ease coughing fits in the paroxysmal stage of pertussis. • To avoid dehydration, drink at least 70 ounces of pure water per day if you're a 75-kilogram (165 pounds) individual. Refrain from consuming commercial fruit juices and sports drinks, as they not only may contain inflammation-causing sugars, but are lacking in a variety of organic nutrients. • Get rid of irritants in your home that may cause coughing fits, such as aerosol sprays and smoke from tobacco and stoves. • Rest and relax in a cool and quiet bedroom. • Help ease coughing fits by using a cool-mist vaporizer.

A 2014 study found that antihistamines, pertussis immunoglobin and salbutamol may not help ease coughing fits caused by pertussis.30 If you plan to take these medications to help relieve whooping cough, seek your health care provider's advice before doing so.

Also, unless advised by your doctor, cough medicines are not recommended to be taken by people with pertussis, especially children under 6 years old. Coughing is the body's way of clearing airways, which is why it must not be suppressed.31

Whooping Cough Prevention: Is There a Way to Restrain This Disease?

Whooping cough is an airborne respiratory disease that targets the immune system. Simply inhaling the tiny droplets released from an infected person's mouth might put you at risk. Here are some ways to help prevent acquiring this disease:32

If you have pertussis, cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing — doing this may help restrain the spread of bacteria in the air.

Promote proper hygiene everywhere you go. Pertussis is as contagious as the common cold. As much as possible, wash your hands using mild soap and water. While many hospitals and health care factions also endorse using hand sanitizers, actually many of these sanitizers contain isopropyl alcohol, which can dry your hands and increase your risk of absorbing toxins, so if you do use sanitizers, do it minimally.

A 2007 study showed that whooping cough in infants is largely transmitted from household members — including asymptomatic persons who were fully vaccinated 33 — who come in close contact with the babies. 34 To avoid this, keep infants away from known infected persons, especially those in the early stages of the disease. 35

— who come in close contact with the babies. To avoid this, keep infants away from known infected persons, especially those in the early stages of the disease. Boost your immune system by getting enough sleep and including foods rich in B vitamins, protein, vitamins A, C and D, fiber and probiotics to your diet.

Diet for Whooping Cough: Which Kinds of Food Should You Eat?

Since pertussis is an airborne disease, it is essential to boost your immune system to prevent it. One way to do this is by keeping an eye on what you eat. To help reduce the risk of having pertussis, here are the kinds of nutrients that you may need to consume:

• Protein — Commonly found in lean meat, bone broth, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, protein may help fight infections. However, be mindful of your protein consumption, as too much protein can also be detrimental to your health, putting you at risk of insulin sensitivity and even cancer. • Vitamin C — Good sources of vitamin C include broccoli, berries, leafy greens, citrus fruits and bell peppers. • Vitamin A — Add carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, organic, pastured eggs, grass fed beef and dark, leafy vegetables to your diet to lower your risk of infection. • Fiber — Help balance your gut microbiome by adding fibrous foods like blueberries, cucumbers, nuts, celery, carrots, banana, papaya and mango to your diet. • Vitamin D — Best acquired through sun exposure, vitamin D may help support your immune response. Raw grass fed milk, wild-caught Alaskan salmon and organic, pastured eggs also contain vitamin D. • Probiotics — Fermented foods are rich in probiotics that help balance the intestinal bacteria. These include fermented vegetables, natto, kimchi, pickles, miso, kefir, tempeh and raw grass fed yogurt. • B vitamins — Boost your immunity by consuming foods with vitamin B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid) and B12 (cobalamin) such as dark, leafy greens, mackerel, sardines, anchovies, pastured organic chicken, yogurt, cheese and raw, organic grass fed milk.

Croup Versus Whooping Cough: What's the Difference?

Whooping cough, as mentioned, is a respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. Its notable symptoms are runny nose, mild fever and coughing bouts that produce a ""whoop"" sound when inhaling.36

On the other hand, croup is another name for laryngotracheobronchitis and laryngotracheitis. Croup is commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, influenza and adenovirus may also lead to croup. It is an infection that interferes with breathing and is common in children because they have small airways.

Croup symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and fever. An infected person may develop a hoarse voice, a high-pitched wheezing sound or stridor and a seal-like cough. Similar to pertussis, croup may be fatal to infants, but it is rare.37

Unlike whooping cough, croup may not be as serious. Home treatments may help ease it, and only about 5 percent of infected children will require hospitalization.38

409,Empty,2019-02-22T13:00:00Z,Julia* was 16 years old when a man more than three times her age tried to undo her bra.,"Loading She was told it was her own fault that she was repeatedly harassed by her male co-workers, she says. Julia believes that the fact her abusers also had intellectual disabilities meant their alleged offences were seen as lesser crimes. Now 31-years-old, the trauma is still with her. “I felt I had no control over what happened to me,” Julia says. “That feeling is never completely gone."" Julia is just one of many women with intellectual disabilities who have been harassed, abused, assaulted - and ignored. Momentum is building behind the push from Labor and the Greens' for a royal commission into abuse in the disability services sector. The government waved through the parties' motion on Monday, agreeing in principle to a royal commission. However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not commit to a timeline for the inquiry, saying it would first need the agreement of all states and territories.

But the first hurdle to any meaningful inquiry is Australia's lack of robust data that traces the true extent of what experts call an endemic and hidden crisis. “We know women with disability are silenced by the perpetrators of the abuse,” says Associate Professor Patsie Frawley at Deakin University. ""We know violence against women with disabilities is often unreported and when it is reported it is dismissed, ignored or covered up."" Through her community outreach work Frawley has collected countless testimonials from women with an intellectual disability who have been sexually abused. But the reports of abuse are not being tracked at a state or national level.

The 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey shows that more than 43 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds with a disability or long-term health condition report experiencing sexual harassment. That is almost double the proportion of people without a disability or long-term health condition. But because the figure is based on a household survey, it does not capture the population of women with a disability living in facilities or who would not readily disclose abuse, Frawley says. And many facilities, such as boarding houses, prisons and women's shelters, don't identify women with disabilities in their records, ""so there's not a clear and full picture"", she says. And an erroneous, often-quoted statistic: ""90 per cent of women with disability have experienced violence and abuse"", is a two-decade-old conflation of several Canadian studies. “A royal commission would give us the opportunity to get some really good Australian data,” Frawley says. 'I was very terrified'

Soon after Julia started working at the sheltered workshop, several older male employees found her in the phone directory and left countless voicemail messages asking her to be their girlfriend. Loading Through tears, Julia recalls working alone in a storeroom when she felt hands fumbling with her bra clasp. It was a male co-worker aged in his 50s. “I turned around and said ‘why did you do that?’ and he said ‘because I can’.” On another occasion, a male co-worker in his 20s touched her bottom, rubbed himself against her and laughed. She reported the incidents to her boss, who said he would talk to the men.

But Julia was later told that their behaviour was expected, given her youth and appearance, she says. She was advised not to engage with or smile at her co-workers. As she rode the bus home from work one afternoon she saw one of her abusers on the same bus. She panicked, got off the bus, crossed the road and was hit by a car. She sustained a skull fracture and a mild brain injury. She was again traumatised when one of her abusers visited her in hospital. The day she returned to work, she learned the man who had touched her bottom had been making loud sexual noises, moaning her name and making lewd gestures with the workshop machinery as he invited other men to join in. “A female co-worker told me she was scared for me … she was worried [the man] would take the next step of rape,” Julia says. “I was very terrified and became angry.""

She confronted the man in the lunchroom, yelling at him and threatening to call the police. But the most demoralising act, she says, was the reaction from her managers. Julia was ordered to the head manager’s office where several other section bosses were waiting. She says the door was slammed shut behind her and locked, she was reprimanded and her job was threatened. “They told me I had no right to have an outburst at a male with an intellectual disability,” she says. “They said it was very inappropriate of me and it was not tolerated in the workplace.” The intimidating experience was the final straw. Julia had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised. 'It's okay to speak up'

When the perpetrators of harassment and assault are people with an intellectual disability it can be seen as “less of a crime”, Frawley says. The daily, pervasive sexual abuse of women with a disability were usually reported as ""incidents"" and dealt with internally, she says. “We need to take them out in the open and call them what they are. These are crimes.” Julia was an exception. The teenager and her mother launched a long and costly court battle against her employer; it was later settled. But she had lost her job, her self-esteem and her friends. “I couldn’t leave the house for three years. I was very paranoid that someone was going to touch me,” she says. International evidence shows women with disabilities are subjected to higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, both from people close to them and total strangers. The perpetrators might be intimate partners, co-workers, managers, carers and, in isolated cases, transport providers such as taxi drivers. A 2008 survey in the United States found women with severe disabilities were four times more likely to be sexually assaulted than women without disabilities. And a 2005 New Zealand study found women aged between 11 and 17 disclosed experiences of sexual abuse at the hands of step-fathers, mothers' boyfriends and older brothers.

For Julia, it has taken several years of intensive work with a counsellor to claw back her life. “He told me a person who doesn’t have a disability struggles [to overcome the trauma of sexual harassment] but a person with intellectual disabilities struggles 10 times worse,” she says. Julia believes women with intellectual disabilities may be perceived as vulnerable and less likely to defend themselves from sexual harassment and assault. “I want them to know it’s not their fault and it's okay to speak up,” she says. Lawyer and senior advocate at the NSW Council for Intellectual Disability Jim Simpson says a royal commission would “put a spotlight on the terrible injustices that happen so often to people with intellectual disability”. “It's extremely important to have the spotlight of a royal commission because people with disability - by the nature of their disability - find it really hard to identify when their rights are being abused, know what to do about it and have the confidence to seek redress,” Simpson says. “Reporting sexual abuse is so often difficult for any woman. It can be much more difficult for women with intellectual disability.”

It is vital that a royal commission examine all settings, including residential facilities, schools, hospitals, jails, workplaces and within homes, Simpson says. Frawley says there is a role for the National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission to address these issues. The commission - which covers NSW and South Australia - received 29 reports of sexual assault against NDIS participants, and 184 reports overall of abuse or neglect in three months. The Human Rights Commission’s National Inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces was also taking notice, holding a targeted consultation with people with disability in Sydney on Monday. “There is good work being done, but there is a hell of a lot more we need to understand and a lot more that needs to be done,” says Frawley. *Name has been changed","Push for a royal commission into disability sector: the endemic, hidden crisis facing women",Smh.com.au,https://www.smh.com.au/national/push-for-a-royal-commission-into-disability-sector-the-endemic-hidden-crisis-facing-women-20190218-p50ymy.html

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

411,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

RIDE: Although most trails are on MTB Project, for a more localized resource check out swutahtrails.com, a brand-new, one-stop tool for trail descriptions, photos and videos with downloadable maps and GPS navigation. Trails are sorted into geographical zones to showcase the various regions throughout the county.

STAY: You'll find ample lodging options throughout the county via Google. We stayed at a rental house in Sand Hollow Resort, which suited our large group well and was convenient to both Hurricane and St. George. You can also check out Gooseberry Yurts for a more primitive, adventurous option—with four days' worth of riding from your front door. The 20-foot-diameter yurts sleep five to seven adults and cost $150 a night.

EAT: Again, options abound, but you can't go wrong with Lonny Boy's BBQ in Hurricane, George's Corner Restaurant in St. George and the Bit and Spur Restaurant and Saloon in Springdale. Affogato is a worthy coffee shop in St. George, while River Rock Roasting Co., in La Verkin, serves tasty food and everything from coffee to beer on the edge of a canyon carved by the Virgin River.

SHOP: Over the Edge Sports in Hurricane treated our team well, whether that meant providing TLC to the day's testing steeds each evening, sharing local beta on where to ride or leading the way on hard-to-follow loops (OTE also runs a free shop ride every Saturday, which is a great way to see the area's nooks and crannies).

412,Empty,2019-02-22T16:00:00Z,"OPINION: The leaky homes scandal was an education in mismanagement on a grand scale, writes Andrew Bydder.","OPINION: Thank you to all the readers who give great feedback on these columns. Your stories of your own battles with bureaucracy motivate me to keep writing. Suggestions for topics are always welcome, although I have quite a backlog already.

After I touched on untreated timber a couple of weeks ago, several people asked for me to expand on leaky buildings. It is a woe-begotten tale of mismanagement on a grand scale.

In 1996, the Commission of Inquiry into leaky buildings of the previous decade bemoaned ""a loss of collective memory, and lack of conventional wisdom, among inspectors, architects, engineers, developers, and contractors regarding the requirements for effective building"".

""Hang on"" the astute reader may ask, ""wasn't the problem in the period from 1998 to 2003?""

The National Party had been under pressure from the Greens because timber treatment uses some particularly nasty chemicals (such as arsenic) that could be bad for the environment. Untreated timber was allowed to be used for house framing on 28 February 1998, until the Building Industry Authority issued a directive on 9 March 2003, re-introducing treatment for all consents.

The Commission of Inquiry mentioned above was the Canadian inquiry. They had a massive and highly publicised problem. Sure, this was the era before Google, so research took more than a mouse click, but the most basic due diligence a government should carry out prior to changing regulations would be to check what other countries' experiences have been. New Zealand blindly copied a known disaster.

The blame doesn't lie solely with untreated timber. Town planners with no construction experience started using roof area instead of floor area, measuring boundary dimensions to roof lines instead of walls, and setting arbitrary height limits – all because it meant more resource consents would be needed.

Developers responded with the infamous ""Mediterranean style"", totally unsuited to our climate conditions, with flat roofs and no overhangs allowing them to squeeze the most building space into the rules.

Post-disaster, planners actually returned to rules that reflected the needs of the building industry to some extent. But after a decade, I started to see an influx of the same rules and interpretations that created so many problems. It seems we don't learn from history.

Most architects, including myself, had trained at Auckland University, where the Architecture School was split into petty factions, many staff had no practical experience, and it was greater ""status"" to teach theory than technical skills. In short, the education was negligent and the qualification just about worthless for anything outside of academia. It took ten years to teach myself to be competent for the sort of complicated buildings we were designing.

The standard of drawings given to builders was not good enough for the high-risk details that were required.

The dismantling of apprenticeships meant young chippies and tradies were unleashed on buildings without the experience to work through difficult projects. In earlier times, skilled main contractors would be on site to check and coordinate work, but a new breed of project managers were saving clients money by tendering out each trade separately, with no supervision of specialist skills on the actual project. I set up my own practice primarily so I could refuse projects that involved working with them.

Product suppliers, such as a certain Australian firm, happily sold materials that were simply not suitable for what, where, and how they were being used. Some claddings

relied on nothing more than a coat of paint at every joint to keep water out. It was never going to last.

Helen Clark's Labour Party responded to the disaster by disbanding the Building Industry Authority – the government agency that was the ultimate regulator of the construction system. This was a cynical ploy to remove the government from liability as the BIA could no longer get sued.

Instead, the liability was dumped on councils. Building inspectors had probably the smallest part to play in the debacle. They had no say over the design, did not carry out the faulty workmanship, and were not present during most of the construction.

By tradition, they checked some basic structural, fire, and plumbing issues, as accepted by the BIA and courts up until then. Their processes failed to change with the times, and the courts retrospectively decided that building inspectors should have done more. Their employers - the councils, and therefore the ratepayers, had to shoulder a small proportion of the responsibility.

There is a grossly unfair legal principle that is applied to construction projects called ""joint and several liability"". It exists mainly to ensure lawyers make money by always having someone to sue. That small proportion of responsibility meant councils were jointly liable for the whole thing. When problems arose, building firms went bust, and councils were the ""last man standing"".

The courts reached deep into ratepayers' pockets. You, the public, ended up paying for the damage, while most perpetrators never paid a cent.

Along with many others in the architecture profession, I have lobbied hard to change the law to ""proportional liability"" for leaky buildings and any other problems. We should each take our fair share of responsibility, and limit councils' exposure to their small share. Government legal advisers have resisted.

I would like to see all councils join together with building professionals and ratepayers' associations to promote this at the national level on behalf of ratepayers.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier found himself in the dock in connection with the case, but a designated CBI court in Thiruvananthapuram discharged him and six other accused on November 5, 2013. The CBI then approached the Kerala High Court, which upheld the discharge of Vijayan and two others. However, it set aside the discharge of three of the accused and directed that the case against them will stand revived in the trial court.

Besides the CBI’s appeal challenging the August 23, 2017 decision of the Kerala HC, the apex court will also consider petitions filed by some of the accused. Congress leader V M Sudheeran too has filed a plea seeking impleadment. The case relates to the award for renovation and modernisation of three hydro-electric projects in the period 1995-1997. The MoU between the Kerala State Electricity Board and Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin was signed on August 10, 1995.

The scandal came to light following an audit by the Principal Accountant General of Audit (Kerala), who pegged the loss to the exchequer at over Rs 300 crores. The report of the PAG triggered a storm, which led to an inquiry by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB). On inquiry, the VACB found some substance in the report of the PAG as regards the suspicious circumstances, and elements of misconduct in the making of the contracts.

Subsequently, the CBI took over the probe following a HC order. In its case, the CBI had alleged that Vijayan, the then electricity minister, had shown undue haste and interest in the execution of the supply contracts in February, 1997, and the KSEB happened to execute such a contract at the instance of the minister in haste when SNC-Lavalin offered some grant for the construction of a cancer hospital – the Malabar Cancer Centre in Kannur.",SNC-Lavalin graft case: Supreme Court to hear final arguments in April,Indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/snc-lavalin-graft-case-supreme-court-to-hear-final-arguments-in-april-5597347/

As early as Tuesday, Canadians could hear directly from Jody Wilson-Raybould on whether she was inappropriately pressured as attorney general to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

But beyond the political scandal, consider the failures of the RCMP and federal prosecutors in the case. Since 2012, the RCMP have charged eight people tied to allegations SNC engaged in bribery of foreign officials. Seven of those accused have had their cases tossed out of court due to delays or problems with evidence. RCMP and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada have yet to convict anyone from the company.

Many are asking whether they are really up to the job.

""Canada has a very poor record of enforcement,"" says James Cohen, head of the watchdog group Transparency International Canada. ""Canadian companies who engage in corruption have sadly been playing the odds that they will not get caught.""

The RCMP and PPSC's umbrella case against the company itself, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc and its subsidiaries, could be prosecutors' last hope.

To put it bluntly — they desperately need a win.

Bribing a dictator

SNC-Lavalin's troubles began in 2011, and unravelled like a spy novel.

The company, whose top construction executive for years paid bribes in Libya to win billions in contracts, moved out of the country temporarily when its patron, dictator Moammar Gadhafi, was ousted and killed.

One month later, as Libya burned, authorities in Mexico arrested a group of alleged plotters accused of trying to smuggle one of Gadhafi's sons to a life in hiding. Among those detained — but released — was an SNC money man, Stéphane Roy.

SNC employees were implicated in funding a plot to smuggle Saadi Gadhafi, son of Libya’s deposed dictator, to Mexico. (Tim Wimborne/Reuters)

A month after that, a senior SNC-Lavalin employee invited a CBC reporter to a remote ski hill in Quebec. He whispered news of an internal revolt at SNC-Lavalin over allegations the top construction exec for years paid bribes and laundered money for the Gadhafi regime through Swiss banks, all to keep contracts flowing to SNC-Lavalin.

Those stories made headlines, sparked firings, police investigations, and eventually criminal charges.

In April 2012, that executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, was arrested in Switzerland where he was held for two and a half years. He pleaded guilty in Switzerland to bribery and laundering millions to win SNC-Lavalin contracts in Libya.

'We've done nothing wrong'

The company has long maintained that any bribes or kickbacks were the work of rogue employees.

The company's latest CEO Neil Bruce told investors on Friday the company will vigorously defend itself against the charge its international construction arm paid bribes.

""We've done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong,"" Bruce said.

To date, the only conviction of anyone at SNC-Lavalin related to foreign bribery was the guilty plea from Ben Aïssa secured by Switzerland.

In Canada, so far every single charge the RCMP has laid has either not stuck — or not yet been to trial.

This month, a charge of obstruction of justice was thrown out against Sami Bebawi due to court delays.

Bebawi was SNC-Lavalin's top construction executive in the years before Riadh Ben Aïssa. RCMP charged Bebawi in 2014, accusing him of sending a lawyer to visit Ben Aïssa in a Swiss prison to offer $10 million if he covered up Bebawi's involvement in Libya. What Bebawi didn't know is that he'd walked into a sting operation. Ben Aïssa has become a vital co-operating witness for the RCMP.

Bebawi still awaits trial in Montreal on fraud and bribery charges tied to SNC-Lavalin's Libya operations..

Roy, the SNC-Lavalin money man detained briefly in Mexico in 2011, also walked out of court free this month. As vice-president of finance under Ben Aïssa, Roy was charged with fraud and bribery tied to Libya. But last week a judge tossed all charges due to ""unreasonable"" delays by the prosecution.

Bangladesh boondoggle

The RCMP and PPSC suffered similar defeats in its case against employees of SNC-Lavalin International in Bangladesh over the company's failed bid to win a $1.3-billion contract to build the Padma Bridge.

The World Bank eventually debarred SNC-Lavalin from bidding on projects for 10 years.

However, Canada's prosecution of five people over the Bangladesh bridge project, including a low level engineer and two executives, eventually failed.

A joint CBC News investigation shows the bribery scandal surrounding Canada’s SNC-Lavalin is even more extensive than first reported, with its own special code involving several foreign countries. 14:55

Charges were dropped against engineer Mohammad Ismail who became a witness, turning over evidence of a widespread system of secret payments used by the SNC-Lavalin division.

The four others were acquitted, after a judge ruled that RCMP wiretap evidence collected by bugging an executive's office was inadmissible.

Complex investigations, changing priorities

Canada has a sparse record of convicting anyone in foreign bribery cases.

To date, the RCMP and PPSC have only ever secured six convictions under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act since its adoption two decades ago.

The RCMP superintendent who led these international investigations says those convictions nonetheless sent a message to corporate Canada.

""The early cases in Canada which resulted in fines to corporations led to compliance regimes being established country-wide by Canadian firms operating globally,"" says Biagio Carrese, a 29-year veteran anti-money laundering investigator with the RCMP.

Notably, he says, the three-year prison term handed down to Nazir Karagar of CryptoMetrics Canada for attempting to bribe government officials in India put Canadian executives on notice.

""The impact was immediate. It set a precedent,"" said Carrese, who has left the RCMP and now works in the private sector.

He declined to comment on the SNC-Lavalin case, but acknowledges foreign bribery cases can fail — or struggle — due to their international scope, legal and technical complexity, and the need for an intense amount of time, resources and special expertise.

RCMP's National Division had 115 dedicated investigators by 2013. A year later, after the Parliament Hill shootings, and the rise of homegrown ISIS sympathizers, many investigators were reassigned to anti-terrorism, depleting resources in the fight against foreign bribery.

""In a world of ever-changing priorities, this can be difficult. I believe this to be true of police and prosecutors,"" Carrese said.

Watch: SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds in front of the Justice Committee

Canada's top civil servant shared some strong words with the Justice Committee regarding the ever-growing SNC-Lavalin scandal. So what should we make of his testimony? And are we any closer to understanding what actually happened? The At Issue panel is back looking for the answers. 12:57

Transparency International, in its 2018 report Exporting Corruption, noted a recent deterioration in enforcement in Canada, noting no new major cases launched in recent years.

Convictions in Canada

While no SNC-Lavalin employee has been convicted of foreign bribery, the company has faced humiliating headlines over corruption here at home.

Sûreté du Québec and provincial prosecutors won convictions against former CEO Pierre Duhaime and his executive vice-president of construction Ben Aïssa over bribes paid to win the $1.3-billion contract to build the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) superhospital.

RCMP is also still investigating SNC-Lavalin over $2.3 million in kickbacks paid to the head of the Federal Bridge Corp. Appointee Michel Fournier (former chief of staff to Jean Chrétien) is serving a five-and-a-half year prison term for accepting payments to Swiss bank accounts coded named ""Zorro"" while doling out bridge contracts.

Today, as politicians and the public debate the fate of SNC-Lavalin, and whether it ought to be offered an out of court deal to resolve the foreign bribery case, the police and prosecutors who toiled for years no doubt have a thirst to see their work put before the courts.

Beyond the law, the politics, the potential impact on this giant company — our public guardians have spent untold millions building a case and to date have little to show for it.","What's at stake for RCMP, prosecutors in the SNC-Lavalin case",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-bribery-snc-lavalin-case-1.5031712

Are the Liberals worse or better off for the blunt unapologetic testimony of Canada’s top civil servant Michael Wernick in front of a parliamentary committee on Thursday? The short answer is a bit of both.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a donor appreciation event for the Liberal Party of Canada in downtown St. John's on Feb. 22, 2019. This is the week when polls started to document the damage to the Liberal re-election prospects in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal and it’s not looking good, Chantal Hébert writes. ( Paul Daly / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

But first some context: if anyone still had doubts that this is a full-fledged storm and not a passing squall the sight of two of the biggest government players in the national capital stepping out of the shadows — one of them to self-immolate — should have dismissed them. In terms of power and influence, Wernick in his ongoing role as Clerk of the Privy Council and Gerald Butts in the post of principal secretary that he relinquished on Monday, rank or ranked, just below the prime minister himself. This is the week when polls started to document the damage to the Liberal re-election prospects. It is real and significant.

Among voters who are keeping track of the story, only a small minority — 12 per cent — readily agree with Trudeau’s assertion that he crossed no line in his dealings with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould over whether SNC-Lavalin should be offered a remediation agreement in lieu of exposing it to a criminal conviction that would result in the firm being barred from bidding on federal contracts for a decade. The rest are split equally — with 41 per cent on each side — between those who believe Trudeau is in the wrong and those who have yet to make up their minds.

Based on those numbers, the odds that the prime minister can ever win a majority over to his version of events range from slim to non-existent, notwithstanding all that may yet happen over the next few days and all that came to light this past week. For the Liberals, the only win on offer in this battle may be to succeed in putting the issue behind them as long as possible before the upcoming election campaign gets officially underway. After this week they are not there yet. By the time Wernick appeared in front of the justice committee Thursday, Canadians had been presented with the double riddle of Wilson-Raybould and Butts’ resignations compounded by a series of unhelpful clues provided by the prime minister. The Clerk was the first of the main protagonists in the saga to provide a comprehensive take on the internal discussions that attended the SNC-Lavalin file. At a minimum, his testimony moved the goalposts of the story. Before Wernick testified, it was possible to construct a narrative that featured partisan PMO operatives empowered implicitly or actively by the prime minister to wade into political interference territory so as to force the attorney general to follow his preferred judicial course in the SNC-Lavalin file. The clerk’s appearance effectively killed the notion of a rogue PMO operation on the former attorney general. This one was sanctioned by no less than Canada’s top civil servant. Whether that is reassuring or makes the entire affair more ominous is a matter of debate and a vigorous one is already underway. Yes, Wernick said, pressure was put on the attorney general — repeatedly and including by him — to weigh the consequences of putting a firm like SNC-Lavalin and the thousands of jobs that it provides at risk by pursuing a criminal trial rather than a remediation agreement. But he is adamant that pressure was neither undue nor inappropriate but rather a result of legitimate government efforts to “get it right.” Part of Wernick’s role as Clerk is to provide the prime minister of the day and his political staff with guidance as to the lines they are not to cross in their dealings with the machinery of government. He would be the go-to person Trudeau and/or his advisers would consult if they had any doubts as to the propriety of their interventions. By his own account, he found no cause for concern. Wernick’s unequivocal contribution to the SNC-Lavalin saga puts him on the same page as both Trudeau and Butts — a fact that can only be a source of comfort to both of them. But it essentially removes the already slim possibility that common ground could be found between the perspective the former attorney general will hopefully soon share with Canadians and that of the prime minister as to what took place between them.

MONTREAL -- Amid an ongoing scandal that has rocked the Liberal government in Ottawa, the head of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. said he's tired of seeing his employees ""used as a puck in a political hockey game.""

""Frankly, they don't deserve it. And we've had enough,"" chief executive Neil Bruce said Friday after slashing the company's dividend and reporting its biggest quarterly losses in at least two decades.

The beleaguered engineering and construction giant has been in the eye of a firestorm that erupted earlier this month when the Globe and Mail reported the Prime Minister's Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to steer prosecutors toward negotiations with the company.

The company was looking to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with fraud and bribery charges linked to business dealings with Moammar Gadhafi's now-toppled regime in Libya.

In a YouTube video released by SNC on Friday, president and CEO Neil Bruce said the company is seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a criminal trial, but has not asked for the fraud and corruption charges to be dropped.

“It’s not easy for myself, for the management team, or for all of our dedicated, hard-working employees to see SNC-Lavalin’s name effectively in the media repeatedly as it has been over the last couple of weeks,” Bruce said in the interview with SNC’s External Communications Director Daniela Pizzuto.

“This is more of a political inquiry ... I want to categorically say – that we have done nothing wrong as a company. And none of our employees have done anything wrong as a company.”

Bruce said he wasn't holding out much hope for a remediation agreement, which would allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a criminal trial in exchange for fines and other penalties.

""That's certainly at their discretion,"" he said. ""But frankly, it doesn't look like that today.""

SNC-Lavalin chopped its dividend by 65 per cent Friday as it reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion.

It will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share compared with its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share.

Bruce said problems at a mining project in Chile were ""incredibly disappointing,"" noting the company's mining and metallurgy and oil and gas segments had underperformed, prompting a pair of profit warnings earlier this year.

Ongoing diplomatic tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia have jeopardized future contracts in the Middle Eastern kingdom, Bruce said last month after announcing a $1.24-billion impairment charge related to SNC-Lavalin's oil and gas business.

The Jan. 28 announcement, combined with news about delays at the Chilean mining project and an arbitration loss in Australia, sent shares plummeting 27 per cent to close at $35.01, their lowest since September 2012.

Analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities advised investors to ""keep calm and carry on.""

""There remain lots of challenges ahead for SNC, but none of which we would view as insurmountable and more than reflected in the current share price,"" he said in a research note Friday.

A criminal case could result in a ban of up to 10 years on bidding on federal contracts.

Bruce noted that until a conviction comes down, the company faces no bidding restrictions in Canada.

""Basically, they don't penalize you until you're found guilty.""

""This overhang continues to be there,"" he added, ""and competitors in the U.S....use that against us.""

Analysts pointed to a potential sale of some of the company's 16.77 per cent stake in Ontario's 407 ETR highway in 2019. The company has been mulling a partial sale for at least six months, which would hand it a slice of the $2.2 billion some analysts say the stake is worth.

The Montreal-based company's loss for its fourth quarter amounted to $9.11 per diluted share. That compared with a profit of $52.4 million or 30 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Revenue totalled $2.56 billion, down from $2.92 billion.

On an adjusted basis, SNC reported a loss of $1.31 per diluted share compared with an adjusted profit of 98 cents per diluted share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected a loss of $1.19 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

SNC has declined BNN Bloomberg’s multiple interview requests this week.

The post How many times did Jody Wilson-Raybould need to say ‘No’? appeared first on Macleans.ca.","Update: On Feb. 27, 2019, Jody Wilson-Raybould testified during an extended opening statement to the House of Commons justice committee. Read the full transcript of her statement here.

Since its outset, l’affair SNC-Lavalin has been framed as a “he said, she said.” More accurately, the messy scandal arising from allegations that the PMO pressured then-justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a prosecutorial break to the powerful Quebec company has been a “he, he, he-said,” while “she” consults with her lawyer about how much she can say. We’ll learn the answer to that next week when Wilson-Raybould speaks before the House justice committee.

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it.

Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard?

The matter involving SNC-Lavalin’s bid for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) was settled, theoretically, on Sept. 4, when Kathleen Rousell, the director of Public Prosecutions, informed the company in writing it would ineligible for a remediation agreement as part of a DPA, and thus would have to stand trial on charges it had engaged in bribery and fraud in Libya. As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could have overruled the prosecution service, and thus preserve SNC-Lavalin’s unfettered access to billions in government contracts. She did not. That was a “No.” Assuming a “No” is final in this setting, however, is to naively underestimate the determination and the clout of the Montreal construction giant that lobbied so effectively to have deferred prosecution agreements passed into law last year.

Not even two weeks after the decision was made, on Sept. 17, Wilson-Raybould discussed the SNC-Lavalin file with the prime minister. As Trudeau reported it, the attorney general felt the need to ask him whether he planned to tell her what to do concerning the prosecution. Any decision “was hers alone to make,” Trudeau told her, a bit of moral suasion familiar to any parent.

The next day, Sept. 18, SNC-Lavalin, clearly not about to take the prosecutors office’s decision, nor Wilson-Raybould’s decision not to overrule it as a “No,” met with Wernick and Finance Minister Bill Morneau to discuss “justice and law enforcement.”

Another letter from Rousell to SNC-Lavalin, this one dated Oct. 9, confirmed again in writing that the company will not be invited to negotiate a remediation agreement. The next day, Oct. 10, SNC-Lavalin issued a news release to say it strongly disagreed with the director of prosecutions’ position and remained open and committed to negotiating a remediation agreement.

Exactly who it would negotiate with was unclear. What we do know is that between early October and Nov. 19 SNC-Lavalin met with two different senior PMO advisors— Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard— to discuss “justice and law enforcement.” Visits by SNC-Lavalin lobbyists to the PMO would total 14.

The trees turned colour, leaves fell, chill filled the air, and Jody Wilson-Raybould was still talking about SNC-Lavalin at a Dec. 5 lunch at the Chateau Laurier with Gerry Butts, who has said he told the then justice minister to talk to Wernick.

Wernick revealed this week that he raised the issue of SNC-Lavalin during a Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould. He conveyed to her that the prime minister and others were “quite anxious” about the possible economic consequences if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty. That is understandable. Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec. But the law bars prosecutors from considering the national economic interest when they consider offering deferred prosecution to companies charged with bribing foreign officials. Wernick employed a too-big-to fail rhetoric, expressing concern that the board might decide to “close, sell” the company which “would have consequences for 9,000 Canadians, plus the suppliers, plus the pensioners, plus all the communities in which the company’s active.” And the company’s “share price had tanked,” he said.

In all of those conversations “there was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” Wernick said. Even more risible was a comment he’d make later in a scrum with reporters when asked why he’d continue to contact the attorney general three months after a decision had been made: “Because the decision had not already been made,” he said.

We’re talking Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting here. Clearly the “No” registered on the SNC-Lavalin DPA on Sept. 4, Sept. 17, Oct. 7, Dec. 19 did not register as an actual or final decision. As for pressure? She must be imagining things! After all, the decision was Wilson-Raybould’s alone to make. And the insurance kicker: If Wilson-Raybould did feel she was being pressured to override the decision to prosecute, it was up to her to protest to the very office applying pressure, or resign. If she didn’t, well, it’s nobody’s fault but hers. Her behaviour is the problem. As I said, it’s an age-old template.

As for “How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say ‘No?’ before being heard?” It’s a trick question. The correct answer: Zero.

The startling news came Friday afternoon during a technical briefing where city officials revealed the bidders chosen to work on the massive infrastructure project.

The city is planning to borrow an additional $700 million over 30 years to cover the inflated cost. The expansion, which will add 44 kilometres of track and 24 new stations, is now scheduled to be finished by 2025 instead of 2023.

East West Connectors is the top choice to expand the east-west Confederation Line. The consortium is led by Omaha, Neb.-based construction conglomerate Kiewit, which worked on Toronto's Spadina Subway extension, as well as France-based Vinci.

Its bid came in at $2.57 billion, well above the $1.98 billion target the city had set.

The Confederation Line expansion project will see the line extended to Trim Road in the east and Moodie Drive in the west, as well as an extension to Algonquin College.

It was supposed to be completed by 2023, but that assumed the first 12.5-kilometre stage, from Blair to Tunney's stations, would be up and running by the first half of this year.

Allan Hubley, right. (Kate Porter/CBC)

Behind schedule

That's not going to happen, with fewer than half of the 34 vehicles completed, testing far behind schedule and recent concerns about the system's ability to deal with Ottawa winters.

As reported by CBC News, ​SNC-Lavalin beat out two international consortia to win the north-south Trillium Line extension, worth more than $600 million. It would see the line extended into Riverside South, as well as a spur to the airport.

SNC-Lavalin bid for the contract under the name TransitNext. This deal, if approved, would also include a 30-year maintenance contract, making SNC-Lavalin's contract worth $1.6 billion.

The Montreal-based multinational firm is embroiled in a political controversy over its attempts to avoid criminal prosecution over bribery charges. If SNC-Lavalin faces those charges in court and is found guilty, the company could be blocked from bidding on federal government contracts for a decade.

SNC-Lavalin recently slashed its earning projections twice, its shares have hit a 10-year low and its CEO said late last year that the scandal has cost the company $5 billion worth of business.

As well, councillors are sure to question the choice of SNC-Lavalin because of its role as lead partner in Stage 1, which now looks to be delayed a third time. It's unclear when the first phase will be complete.

Mayor Jim Watson has said he's not concerned about the controversy.

Province's share unconfirmed

The bill for Stage 2 is supposed to be split three ways between the city, provincial and federal governments.

The federal cash is confirmed, and the previous Ontario government committed $1.2 billion for Stage 2 in a letter to the mayor in May 2018.

But the Progressive Conservative government elected last spring has still not confirmed the cash, despite Premier Doug Ford having said he supported the light-rail expansion during the 2018 election.

Watson is supposed to be speaking with the premier about the matter at Queen's Park on Tuesday, just a day before council is set to debate the contracts, the largest infrastructure project the city has ever undertaken.

Bennett recently appointed Kim Baird, a consultant and former chief of the Tsawwassen First Nation, as one of two representatives that will be involved in talks with First Nations to revamp policies on comprehensive claims, also known as modern treaties, and self-government.

The Crown-Indigenous Relations (CIRNA) department began rolling out its engagement process for revamping these new policies in January. CIRNA documents, obtained by CBC News, show the department is aiming to have the new policies announced by June 2019.

The effort is part of the Liberal government's attempts to salvage part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's promise to refashion Canada's relationship with Indigenous Peoples through a legislated framework on Indigenous rights that has been shelved.

CIRNA is also moving on changing policies on how lands are added to reserves and the settling of historical grievances over lost lands and mishandled trust money — known as specific claims.

Bennett appointed Baird alongside Tom Isaac, a prominent Vancouver lawyer with an expertise in Indigenous law who acted as a former B.C. government treaty negotiator and has been a federal ministerial representative on various Indigenous files.

Baird's role in modern treaty settlement raises concern

Neskonlith Indian Band Chief Judy Wilson said concerns with Baird date back to her 2016 appointment by the Liberal government to a three-member National Energy Board environmental review panel for the Trans Mountain pipeline project.

""To me there was a perceived conflict of interest at that time,"" said Wilson. ""Somehow, the government keeps hiring her.""

Baird was involved in a leadership exchange program in 2010 with Ian Anderson, the current CEO of Trans Mountain and the former president of Kinder Morgan Canada.

Baird also lobbied the federal government for Woodfibre LNG in 2015, according to the federal lobbyist registry. Woodfibre LNG is a $1.6 billion LNG export project in B.C. Woodfibre recently signed a $224 million, 40-year deal with the Squamish First Nation.

Wilson said the controversy over her 2016 NEB review panel appointment should have disqualified her from involvement in talks to change modern treaty policy which is about Aboriginal title and lands — two central factors fuelling opposition to the Trans Mountain project.

""Kim Baird is a non-starter,"" said Wilson, whose First Nation sits in B.C.

Wilson said Baird's leadership role with her First Nation when it signed B.C.'s first urban modern treaty in 2009 is also problematic. Wilson said Baird has been appointed to help lead talks to significantly change to the very policy behind the modern treaty signed by her community

""A lot of our communities are non-treaty and some would feel they are being railroaded into some sort of treaty process that is a narrow process because you have a [modern] treaty person rolling out these … policies,"" said Wilson, who is also secretary-treasurer for the Union of BC Indian Chiefs.

""The issue we have with [the treaties] is this narrow process of extinguishment, or modified extinguishment...all of the issues are still the same.""

'Work speaks for itself'

Baird said she was chosen for her experience in the field and she wouldn't be pushing any particular view on any of the First Nations she meets.

""All my work has been in relationship building, helping enable that,"" said Baird, who is a personal friend of Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister currently embroiled in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""I think it's not my personal style to shove a personal model on any community. I can share the perspective of how it works for Tsawwassen and other models...again, I really believe it's up to First Nations.""

Baird said her past experience has given her the necessary tools to do the work the minister has appointed her to accomplish.

""I have lots of experience in engaging with First Nations in controversial issues,"" said Baird. ""My work speaks for itself and through my long career I developed lots of relationships with lots of people.""

AFN says process developed 'unilaterally'

Baird's role is to engage with First Nations in B.C., Ontario, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.

Isaac was mandated to engage with First Nations in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Quebec and the East Coast.

Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde has called on Ottawa to change its modern treaty and self-government policies, but has stressed it needs to be First Nation-led. The AFN has also passed resolutions to this effect.

The AFN said in a statement that the process unveiled by CIRNA was ""unilaterally developed."" The statement said that the AFN was only provided the plan for comment in January.

The AFN statement said that CIRNA's timelines may be too tight. The department wants the engagement process completed by May 2019.

""The AFN will not support a process that is not First Nations led, and that has predetermined outcomes,"" said the statement.

Bennett's office said that department officials requested a proposal on the engagement process from the AFN on Dec. 6, 2018, but only received a response on Feb. 8.

Finally, we ge…","The federal fisheries minister says the anticipated increase in tanker traffic should cabinet approve the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline will have little impact on the endangered southern resident killer whales in the waters off B.C.'s coast.

""It's important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline,"" Jonathan Wilkinson tells The House after the National Energy Board reconfirmed its earlier approval the controversial project as being in the national interest.

The report released Friday is a response to a Federal Court of Appeal ruling that found the original NEB study was inadequate because it failed to take into account the impact on marine life and, in particularly, the 74 remaining southern resident killer whales.

""There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year,"" said Wilkinson, who represents North Vancouver riding. ""There are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there's a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.""

The National Energy Board on Friday confirmed its original decision that the controversial expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline is in the national interest and should be approved. We asked Minister Jonathan Wilkinson about the impact it will have on the marine environment. 12:43

The NEB report makes 16 additional recommendations to reduce the project's impact on marine life, but leaves it to the federal government to decide whether to follow through on them.

Wilkinson tells host Chris Hall that the federal government has already moved shipping lanes away from the whales' feeding grounds, required ships to reduce speed to lower noise levels and is working on new technology to reduce vessel noise.

""But we are doing so in a way that allows us to continue to grow exports for Canada and ensure economic prosperity.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has insisted major energy projects can only proceed if they obtain social licence from affected communities. Wilkinson says that doesn't mean everyone will be happy with the government's decision.

""It doesn't ever mean unanimity,"" Wilkinson says. ""But it is incumbent to engage in those conversations thoughtfully and that's where social licence comes from. You are are actually responding to people's concerns in thoughtful and constructive ways. I believe, you know, that we are in the process of doing that.""

Christianne Wilhelmson, the executive director of the Georgia Strait Alliance, says the NEB report simply checks a box for the government.

She argues that the government has shown again that Trans Mountain takes precedence over the killer whales and the marine environment.

The Georgia Strait Alliance was one of the interveners in the marine protections element of the Trans Mountain expansion. They had some serious concerns with the original process, and they aren't thrilled with the update either. Their executive director joins The House. 6:01

Can the new NAFTA live while tariffs prevail?

Transport Minister Marc Garneau said the federal government isn't ruling out delaying Canada's ratification of the new North American free trade pact until after the U.S. lifts controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

Garneau, who chairs the cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations, said holding back on ratifying the Canada-United-States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) would create challenges, but it's something his government is considering.

The government tabled the text of the treaty in mid-December; it can't introduce implementation legislation before March.

""We will, as you know, look at the implementation after the 18th of March, but what I'm saying to you is that we will be doing some serious thinking about whether we want to proceed forward with it ... you know the situation with respect to steel and aluminum is not yet resolved,"" he told Chris Hall.

'The potential for short-term pain is really substantial,' says Scotiabank deputy chief economist Brett House. 6:49

""I'm not saying that it's a show stopper, but it certainly is an impediment because we have a good deal with the United States and — without the tariffs in place — we're very happy with the deal.""

Meanwhile, Canada's top man in Washington said he thinks U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum will be lifted in the next few weeks — but wouldn't elaborate on what's motivating that optimism.

Drilling down into the justice committee's Lavalin investigation

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick waits to speak at the justice committee meeting in Ottawa on Thursday. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

It's not often that the Clerk of the Privy Council appears before a parliamentary committee, so, when Michael Wernick showed up at the justice committee on Thursday to talk about Jody Wilson-Raybould and the SNC-Lavalin affair, everyone was listening intently.

Right from the outset Wernick made it clear he didn't just come to take questions. He intended to make a statement.

He used the kind of blunt language that is not typical of the way bureaucrats usually speak in public.

He set out some of the details of meetings the former attorney general had, what was discussed on SNC, and whether solicitor-client privilege — the reason for Wilson-Raybould's silence — should apply.

To help us parse some of what Wernick said, Chris Hall sat down with public administration expert Lori Turnbull. She's the director of Dalhousie University's School of Public Administration in Halifax and worked for two years in and around the PCO.

What political impact particularly would Wernick's statement have on the prime minister and Jody Wilson-Raybould, who both say they are bound by solicitor-client privilege?

I mean clearly that's been her line from Day One. She is bound by solicitor-client privilege because as attorney general she is the lawyer to the government and therefore she can't say anything she is pressuring the government to go back to that word pressure again. You know there is a kind of you know pressure out there in the media. She is saying 'I want to tell my truth and therefore I have to be released by the government.'

You know in terms of my responsibilities under solicitor-client privilege in order to be able to say that I think warnings point in this case is that she's not a solicitor in this case in this sort of you know in a way that we can imagine some other solicitor-client relationships.

I mean she it's not that the government is accused of anything and she is a solicitor in the sense that she's giving the government advice on how to navigate this charge against them. That's not the case. The court in her context is the role of attorney general. She is making a decision about whether or not whether or not SNC-Lavalin should be able to pursue a DPA.

Jody Wilson-Raybould has been clear that she's ready and willing to tell her story in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. But what's far from clear is whether the Liberal government, or the law, will let her do that. The situation is complex and our Salimah Shiviji explains why. 2:16

If you have made a decision and people keep asking you if it's still an option to do something different, is it reasonable to suggest that that's pressure? And if so why didn't she do something about it?

If I made a decision on my life and people kept saying what if, what if, what if, what if this, and they continued on that campaign, of course that's pressure. That seems like a rational sort of conclusion to me and why didn't she do something about it, that's what I don't know. I don't know.

But for some reason when Mr. Wernick went to the committee and he said Miss Wilson-Raybould had an opportunity to come to the prime minister and he's got a 24/7 switchboard and she can call him any time all of a sudden everybody perked up. I think it seemed to resonate on a different level when Wernick made the point that she had this opportunity to come forward.

Let me get some assessment from you of whether you think Michael Wernick's testimony made matters better for the government or made them worse.

He offered what I take to be the clearest, most comprehensive account of what allegedly happened. I think that makes things better in the sense that people can walk away from it and say, 'OK, I understand this a little bit better,' because part of what happens in the kind of unfolding of a scandal is that when people are totally confused they start ... narratives of their own. And so I think he did provide some clarity on some things.

But on the other hand if his comments you know if we take his comments to mean, 'Hey look nothing happened and there's nothing for us to be upset about here,' then why did Gerry Butts resign? And so I think for every question he answered, he opened at least one more.

Feb 22 (Reuters) - SNC-Lavalin’s chief executive said on Friday the Canadian construction company has done “nothing wrong” in the broadening political crisis facing the country’s prime minister.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office is under fire for allegedly pressuring his former justice minister to try to ensure that SNC avoid a corruption trial over charges of bribing Libyan officials.

The federal government had refused SNC’s request for an agreement that would have allowed it to avoid a trial.

“I want to categorically say that we have done nothing wrong as a company,” SNC Chief Executive Neil Bruce told analysts on a conference call following the release of quarterly results. “We have never asked for charges to be dropped.”

Montreal-based SNC has been seeking to avoid a corruption trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing have left the company, and it has overhauled ethics and compliance systems.

Bruce on Friday also said he would not “give up” on pursuing business interests in Saudi Arabia, despite strained relations between Ottawa and Riyadh. Relations between the two countries have been tense as Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the immediate release of jailed rights activists.

“We’re not going to take that and give up, and that was the reason why I was there twice last week,” Bruce said.

He said an SNC board committee has hired advisers to look at options to improve shareholder value. Plans to sell a portion of SNC’s 17 percent stake in the 407 toll highway in Canada this year is “progressing well,” he said.

SNC said fourth-quarter revenue at its engineering and construction business fell to C$2.49 billion from C$2.87 billion a year earlier.

The company wrote down C$1.2 billion ($910 million) in oil and gas assets, which resulted in a C$1.6 billion fourth-quarter loss.

SNC lowered its quarterly dividend by 18.7 Canadian cents per share to 10 Canadian cents, as it seeks to save C$131 million in cash annually.

It also reported a C$346 million loss related to a South American mining project, which analysts believe is Chilean state-run miner Codelco’s Chuquicamata copper mine.

SNC projected lower annual revenue from its metals and mining business, as it stops bidding on lump-sum projects going forward.

Excluding one-time items, the company reported a loss of C$1.62 per share. Analysts on average had expected C$1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Earlier on Friday, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he wants to see a business like SNC Lavalin “continue to be successful.” ($1 = 1.3209 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by John Benny in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar)","UPDATE 1-SNC Lavalin posts C$1.6 bln loss, cuts dividend as Saudi prospects worsen",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/snc-lavalin-results-idUSL3N20H43Q

The three firms are moving through a rigorous stage gate process having been selected from 19 applicants and 80 expressions of interest

Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL), one of Canada’s premier science and technology organizations, announced on 2/15/19 that two firms, Starcore Nuclear and Terrestrial Energy have successfully completed the pre-qualification stage of CNL’s invitation, and have been invited to enter the Due Diligence stage.

In these stages, CNL will evaluate with increased rigor, the technical and business merits of the proposed designs, assess the financial viability of the projects, and review the necessary national security and integrity requirements.

StarCore Nuclear’s proposed SMR design is a 14 MWe high-temperature gas reactor. StarCore is proposing to build reactors at both the Whiteshell and Chalk River sites.

Terrestrial Energy’s proposed SMR design is a 195 MWe integral molten salt reactor. CNL did not indicate what site(s) the firm has chosen if selected to build. In the US the firm has been looking at different candidate sites including the Idaho National Laboratory.

The firm Global First Power (GFP), with its key partners Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), has progressed through the second stage of the invitation process, and has been invited to participate in preliminary, non-exclusive discussions regarding land arrangements, project risk management, and contractual terms (Stage 3). These negotiations are not an indication of project approval, and the proposal and proponent must satisfy further stringent evaluation.

GFP/OPG/USNC Team’s proposed SMR design is a 5 MWe high-temperature gas reactor.

The fourth and final stage, Project Execution, would include construction, testing and commissioning, operation and ultimately decommissioning of the SMR unit.

All of these projects are subject to regulatory processes and requirements. The licensing process with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is independent of CNL’s invitation and evaluation stages. Should a project advance to a license application, proponents will be required to undertake meaningful project engagement with the public and Indigenous communities. CNSC is currently conducting pre-licensing vendor reviews with a number of SMR developers.

Background on CNL SMR Program

In June 2017 CNL set the ambitious goal of siting an SMR on a CNL-managed site by 2026. To achieve this, CNL launched a Request for Expressions of Interest to gather input and feedback from stakeholders across Canada and internationally. CNL received 80 responses from academia, energy utilities, potential end users, host communities, and the nuclear supply chain.

Included in those responses were 19 formal responses from technology developers interested in building a prototype or demonstration reactor at a CNL site. Based in part on that strong response, CNL moved forward with announcing a staged invitation process for those vendors interested in siting their demonstration unit. Even as this work is ongoing, the deployment of small modular reactors in Canada is still several years away. .

The proposed flexibility of operations for these new designs enables a wide range of end uses, including pairing SMRs with intermittent renewable sources such as solar or wind energy to ensure grid reliability. In addition to electricity production, the energy from an SMR could be used for the production of hydrogen, for local area heating, or in industrial processes which require heat or steam.

Holtec’s SMR-160 Attracts Support in Ukraine and US

(WNN) Holtec International has made progress with its work on an SMR-160 system through agreements with Energoatom and Exelon Generation announced during the winter meeting of the Holtec Advisory Council for SMR-160, held on 2/8/10 in Jupiter, Florida.

The SMR-160 application is under review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and is in Phase 1 of the three-phase evaluation cycle. State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, the nuclear regulatory authority in Ukraine, is expected to coordinate its regulatory assessment of SMR-160 under a collaborative arrangement with its Canadian counterpart.

At the same meeting, Holtec signed a memorandum of understanding with Exelon Generation, adding Exelon to the SMR-160 team, which currently includes SNC-Lavalin and Mitsubishi Electric.

Chris Mudrick, Exelon Generation senior vice president, Northeast Operations, said in the Holtec statement:

“As the largest nuclear operator in the United States, Exelon Generation is pleased to partner with Holtec to develop an operating model for the SMR-160. This project is a great example of how innovation and new technologies are bringing our industry together and driving the future of nuclear power.”

Under the terms of the MoU, Exelon Generation plans to support SMR-160’s market acceptance, develop a generic deployment schedule and staffing plan, and assist to improve its operability and maintainability features, Holtec said. As SMR-160s are built around the globe, Exelon Generation could provide reactor operating services to customers that lack an established nuclear industrial infrastructure, it added.

Exelon’s move to sign on to support the molten salt project is the second by a US nuclear utility. Southern Nuclear is working with a consortium of developers, including TerraPower, to develop a molten salt reactor.

Holtec describes the SMR-160 as a “passive, intrinsically safe, secure and economical” small modular reactor that has the flexibility to be used in remote locations, in areas with limited water supplies or land, and in unique industrial applications where traditional larger reactors are not practical.

The Holtec meeting was led by the incoming chairman, Michael Rencheck, CEO of Bruce Power, Canada, and attended by invited industry experts from several leading organisations, including Bruce Power, Energoatom, Entergy, Exelon Generation, Southern, Talen Energy, NEI, SNC-Lavalin, Mitsubishi Electric, and several major suppliers. The international contingent consisted of business and technology leaders from Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates.

Holtec Technology Development Partners

On February 14, 2018, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), Global Nuclear Fuel (GNF), Holtec International and SMR LLC announced a collaboration to advance the SMR-160 small modular reactor primarily in the area of fuel development.

The firm also has a joint development agreement with SNC Lavalin and Mitsubishi. Under the agreement, SNC-Lavalin will provide Holtec with a range of nuclear engineering services, including supporting the licensing of the SMR-160 reactor. While the SMR-160 is based on light water reactor technology, it should be noted that SNC-Lavalin is the parent company of Candu Energy.

In August 2015, Mitsubishi signed a long-term partnership agreement with Holtec to develop the instrumentation and control systems for the SMR-160. Holtec has previously secured engineering, design and qualification support for its work on the SMR-160 from the Shaw Group and URS Corporation.

UK-Japan Venture Seeks to Build an HTGR in UK

The firm Penultimate Power has agreed to form a joint venture with the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) to build a novel small modular reactor in the UK to provide power and process heat for heavy industry according to a trade press report.

The partners want to build a 10 MWe high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor (HTGR) in the North East of England, based an R&D design that has been running in Japan since 1998.

Ian Fells, technical director at Penultimate Power and former consultant to the UK Atomic Energy Authority, said the venture is seeking approvals from authorities and he expects the £500m (US$651m) plant will be constructed within the coming 48 months.

The firm has ambitious goals for its HTGR.

“We talk about distributed electricity generation with wind, solar and biomass generation,” says Fells. “Now we’re talking about distributed nuclear generation.”

At this power rating the unit will likely be built as an R&D project to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology. Also, developers haven’t addressed how they plan to license the unit nor take it through the UK GDR process for safety review and environmental assessment.

Long term plans include scaling up the technology to 100 MWe, and building a factory, preferably in Teesside, to construct the modular plants for use across the UK. Though Fells said a timeline for this has not yet been agreed.

The UK Government’s support for SMRs has been a disappointment for developers. It launched a £250m competition in 2015 aimed at commercializing the technology but in 2017 scaled back its ambitions, announcing it would offer just £44m to prove the feasibility of a wider set of designs and then for development activities.

In other SMR news NuScale has said it aims to deploy its SMR design in the UK with the first 60 MWe units aimed for operation in the mid-2020s. Rolls-Royce has submitted design plans to the government for a 220 MWe unit.

Note to readers: AAAS Science Magazine has this week published a terrific article on NuScale with first rate writing and stunning graphics.

China has been developing a 230 MW HTGR with two units attached to a single turbine. However, according to some reports, plans to build 20 of them for domestic use have been postponed in order to revamp the design to be more efficient.

RAB Financing Model Could Attract

Private Investment To Nuclear Energy Projects

(NucNet): The regulated asset base financing model (RAB) for nuclear power plants could attract private investment in the sector because investors are able to see a fixed rate of return as the project is being built, Harminder Singh, a power analyst at London-based data and analytics company GlobalData told NucNet in an email.

Mr Singh said the key problem that RAB addresses is that of the high cost of capital for nuclear power projects. He said the RAB model has been used in other infrastructure sectors in the UK, such as the £4.2bn Thames super sewer project, to provide “comfort to investors in private utilities, especially in water”.

But he warned that the RAB model could shift the risk from the developers to consumers, leading to higher electricity bills.

“The model has so far not been used for projects as expensive as nuclear power plants, which is seen as a key cause for concern.”

The UK government is said to be considering RAB financing for new nuclear following recent decisions by Hitachi to suspend the Wylfa nuclear project in Wales and by

RAB financing is essentially a type of contract drawn up with the backing of government, which calculates the costs and profits of a project before it is started, and allocates an investor’s profits from day one.

That was one of the highlights Monday of testimony by Keith Dodson, co-owner of Texas-based Westney Consulting Group, at the Muskrat Falls inquiry as hearings began for a second week in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.

They assume that what happened to other projects will not happen to them. - Keith Dodson

Westney is an international leader in risk assessment for major projects, and was hired by Nalcor to give advice on the Crown corporation's cost and schedule estimates ahead of final sanctioning of the controversial hydro project in late 2012.

The estimates of a $6.2 billion capital cost and of mid-2017 first power were prepared by SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based engineering firm that later fell out of favour with Nalcor as the project ran into trouble.

'Definitely the exception'

Evidence has revealed that both estimates were extremely aggressive, and practically unrealistic, as Nalcor struggled to keep costs as low as possible.

Critics have charged this was part of a strategy by Nalcor to maintain public support for the project, and ensure it remained the least-cost alternative for Newfoundland and Labrador's future electricity needs.

Dodson said Nalcor was advised that labour productivity was ""decreasing significantly"" around world, a trend that began in 2004 as a result of a greater emphasis on safety and changes in the way contractors were doing business.

But Dodson said SNC-Lavalin's team expressed confidence they could buck that trend, based on what he called ""hard data"" from other hydro projects the company was involved with in Eastern Canada.

""There was a project in the U.S at that time that was achieving (productivity) rates that were not far different from what they were proposing. But it was definitely the exception,"" Dodson said of SNC-Lavalin's productivity estimates.

Dodson said there was notable optimism among Nalcor's project team and within SNC-Lavalin.

But, he added, SNC-Lavalin and Astaldi, the Italian company awarded the critical powerhouse contract, ""did not recognize the change in world productivity. There were numerous projects estimated in the same time period that has suffered about the same fate as this project. A billion or two dollars more than the estimate.""

Estimates artificially low

The inquiry has heard evidence about how the number of labour hours required per cubic metre of concrete poured at Muskrat Falls since construction began in late 2013 is practically double what Nalcor had estimated.

That's part of the reason why construction costs have soared by at least $4 billion, and overall costs are now estimated at nearly $13 billion.

But in a further sign that those early estimates were artificially low, Dodson said the actual productivity rate at Muskrat Falls is in line with worldwide trends.

This aerial photo of the Muskrat Falls dam and power generating station on the Churchill River was taken in November 2018. (Nalcor)

""They were basically the rates we were proposing that we were seeing trends around the world,"" Dodson said of performance at Muskrat Falls.

""The rates that were used in the estimate are half the rates of the actual project. But the actual project against the world (is) very good.""

Meanwhile, Dodson said Nalcor also ignored advice that it take a more cautious approach to its cost estimates, a move that would have added hundreds of millions to the total.

""Purely optimism. They assume that what happened to other projects will not happen to them,"" said Dodson.

As Coun. Diane Deans said, it was ""pretty surprising news for a Friday afternoon.""

That's when the city released a complex 113-page document that councillors — and the public — have less than two weeks to absorb before our elected officials vote on the contract on March 6.

Here are four of the most pressing things you need to know about Ottawa's most expensive infrastructure project in history.

1. How we added more than $1.2B to the price

The total cost for LRT Stage 2 has been a bit of a moving target, but last we heard, the estimate for the project — which will add 44 kilometres of track and 24 new stations — was $3.4 billion. It's now $4.66 billion.

What happened?

Two basic things: the city kept increasing the scope of the project, and massive transit projects got more expensive.

First, the city added about $150 million in civics projects — think water pipe replacements — that made sense to do at the same time the light-rail system was being built.

Apparently, we already had the money for this in another envelope, but it still counts toward the total price of this project.

The price tag for the second stage of Ottawa's light rail system has grown by more than a billion dollars. What are councillors making of the news? We ask two of them. 8:47

The city also added more than $310-million worth of extra stuff, such as escalators and washrooms and a garage at Moodie station, for which there was no funding. We thought we could find the money through better design and smarter engineering, but we didn't.

Then there's the additional money in the Trillium Line extension deal that's supposed to save us cash in the long run.

SNC-Lavalin is the city's top choice to extend the north-south line into Riverside South as well as maintain the system for 27 years.

The city was prepared to spend $1.7 billion on both the expansion and maintenance of the line. But SNC-Lavalin apparently submitted a plan that came in at just $1.6 billion, proposing to upgrade the Trillium Line sooner than planned to cut down on future maintenance costs.

But to make those improvements, the city would have to fork over $236 million earlier than planned, which has jacked up the price of the project.

However, the single biggest additional cost comes from the contractors, who are asking for more money because they say they are facing higher capital costs and risks.

Existing projects are taking longer than expected — Rideau Transit Group (RTG) is at least a year behind schedule building the Confederation Line — and companies are bidding more conservatively, offering longer — and perhaps more realistic — timelines.

Consider that for the extension of the Confederation Line to Moodie in the west and Trim Road in the east, as well as a connection to Algonquin College, the city wanted to pay about $2 billion.

But the lowest bid, brought in by top choice East West Connectors, was $2.57 billion.

The city is now planning to borrow an additional $700 million for transit over the next 30 years. (CBC)

2. How — and how much — we're paying

Under the previous plan, the federal, provincial and municipal governments were going to pay about $1.2 billion each for Stage 2 of the LRT. (And the provincial money isn't technically committed yet.)

Now, the city is paying $2.256 billion, almost half the total price tag.

How will we pay for it? Basically, debt. We will borrow $700 million more than anticipated for transit over the next 30 years, for a total of $5 billion.

The additional borrowing will eventually breach the city's self-imposed limit of debt representing 7.5 per cent of revenue. In other words, for every $100 in property taxes you pay, a maximum of $7.50 should go to debt servicing.

If council approves this plan, it will have to change the city's debt policy.

The province sets the maximum debt-to-revenue ratio at 25 per cent, so the city will be well below that mandated threshold. But it still means that, without raising property taxes significantly, it could be difficult for the city to borrow for other capital projects — think affordable housing or local libraries — and still retain the highest credit rating from debt-rating agencies.

Also, the previous 2017 plan for LRT Stage 2 called for a minimum annual increase in the transit levy of 2.5 per cent. It's now proposed to be three per cent.

3. Monthly instead of milestone payments

During the first stage of LRT, the city has made much of the fact of so-called ""milestone payments"" to RTG.

These are giant lump sums handed over to the contractor once it's completed a significant task in the project. The last milestone cheque the city owes RTG is worth about $260 million and will be handed over once RTG actually finishes the Confederation Line.​

That's not the payment system the city is proposing for Stage 2.

The city will still make some lump-sum payments to contractors — and there are still mechanisms to withhold work that's not complete.

But for Stage 2, the city is also proposing to fork over monthly cheques to cover the bulk of that month's construction costs.

It's easy to see why the proponents want this. These transit projects run late and companies are forced to extend their financing at great cost. They want a more reliable cash flow.

But what's in it for the city? Right now, we're hanging onto our money longer. Why would we want to give that up?

4. The deadline is crazy soon

There are dozens of questions that councillors and members of the public need answered before agreeing to spend more than $4 billion of taxpayers' money.

There's also little time.

The report was released Friday, and there's a special council meeting Wednesday where the public can make presentations and councillors can ask questions. Council is set to vote on the project less than two weeks after they laid eyes on the report — and at the same meeting they're also supposed to vote on the 2019 budget!

Time is apparently of the essence, especially for the Trillium Line bid, which expires at the end of March. But if there was such a concern about the schedule, why was this report not released in January and a meeting held last month?

This is by far the most money that any city council has ever spent in our history. Surely we should spend more than 11 days thinking about what to do next.",4 things you should know about the $4.66B contract for LRT Stage 2,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/4-things-you-should-know-about-the-4-66b-contract-for-lrt-stage-2-1.5030839

TODAY:

The anti-vaccination movement is spreading worldwide, leading to record-setting numbers in the resurgence of preventable disease.

Electric cars are on the rise, but are the vehicles ready for the mainstream? David Common gets behind the wheel to find out.

Missed The National last night? Watch it here.

The global impact of anti-vaxxers

The growth of Europe's anti-vaccination movement so closely mirrors the rise of its populist parties that a new study recommends that health officials use opinion poll data to predict coming measles outbreaks.

The paper, published Monday in the European Journal of Public Health, plotted past clusters of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease against European Parliament election results and found a strong correlation between votes for anti-establishment movements and anti-vax beliefs.

""The higher the level of populist votes in a country, the greater the proportion of the population that believe vaccines are not effective,"" writes Jonathan Kennedy, a researcher at Queen Mary University of London.

Vaccine hesitancy and political populism, he notes, thrive on similar dynamics: A ""profound distrust in elites and experts.""

Measles in Europe hit a 20-year high in 2018, with 83,000 confirmed cases and 72 deaths, driven by a huge outbreak in Ukraine and sizeable transmission clusters in Serbia, France, Italy and Greece.

Globally, the World Health Organization tracked a 50 per cent spike in the entirely preventable disease, finding protracted and growing outbreaks in all regions of the world.

The WHO estimates that 136,000 people died from measles in 2017 and that the MMR vaccine first introduced in the early 1960s now prevents two to three million deaths annually.

Yet parental fears and misinformation about the inoculations have spread widely via the internet, to the point that the UN agency now lists ""vaccine hesitancy"" among its Top 10 threats to global health in 2019.

The consequences of unchecked outbreaks can be devastating.

More than 900 have died in Madagascar, where measles have sickened 68,000 people since last September.

The Philippines has seen 189 measles deaths so far in 2019, with just short of 11,500 confirmed cases as of late last week. And President Rodrigo Duterte's government is considering implementing a ""no vaccination, no enrolment"" policy for public schools in an effort to bring the disease under control.

But the pain and suffering that the disease still causes in the developing world doesn't seem to make much of an impression in richer nations.

Japan is currently experiencing its worst measles outbreak in more than a decade, with 167 reported cases in the first six weeks of 2019, many of them linked to an anti-vax religious group.

Canada now has 14 confirmed cases for the year — 13 in British Columbia and one in Quebec — and Alberta authorities have issued a health alert after an infected traveller spent 19 hours in the Edmonton area, en route from Vancouver to Inuvik, N.W.T.

And a vacationing French family reintroduced measles to Costa Rica last week via an unvaccinated five-year-old boy — the Central American nation's first case since 2014.

However, there are signs of a growing pushback against the anti-vaccination movement.

On Friday, YouTube stopped placing ads on channels that promote anti-vax content, depriving their owners of revenue as part of a concerted effort to clamp down on ""harmful or dangerous"" views. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the company's decision came after several major brands pulled their ads from the platform over concerns that pedophiles have been using it to lure victims.)

And it appears that Pinterest has also been quietly trying to purge anti-vaccination messages from its sharing and scrapbooking site by disabling related searches.

Overcoming now-entrenched anti-vax fears won't be easy, though.

An Angus Reid opinion survey released last week found 83 per cent of respondents ""wouldn't hesitate"" to vaccinate their own children. But 26 per cent admitted at least some concern about potential side effects. And among those who have children under 12 years of age, 20 per cent said the choice to inoculate or not should be left to parents.

Electric road trip

Reporter David Common and a CBC News crew took an all-electric vehicle on a road trip to Detroit. There were some … challenges.

Even before the U.S. border guards joked about our boxy, battery-powered vehicle, we knew we were in trouble. We'd gone off course, depleting that battery, shortening our range and putting in doubt whether we'd even make it to the Detroit Auto Show.

What began as a strong start for our electric vehicle journey was not ending well.

We were test-driving a Kia Soul, one of the least expensive, purely electric vehicles available today. It has a range of 160 kilometres, although frigid winter temperatures lower that to 120 km or so. Cost to recharge: Under $2, so as long as you do it at home. Paying for chargers at gas stations, community centres, malls and so on cost several times more.

Electric vehicles are increasingly popular, but the infrastructure to support them isn't always convenient. David Common waits for a charge in Sarnia, Ont. (Jill English/CBC)

But for the daily commuter, recharging elsewhere isn't needed. The average Canadian commute is 23 km one way, so even with a stop at the soccer field, the grocery store and day care, our car could easily handle a daily commute.

So what's holding people back from embracing EVs?

Survey after survey report the same four barriers: Entry cost — often $15,000 more than the gas model — is the big one.

The remaining three all have to do with range:

Can the car go as far as I need to, without a recharge?

If I have to recharge, are there enough stations along the way?

How long does it take to recharge?

Our entry-level EV would make up the difference in purchase price over a traditional gasoline-powered car in less than five years of never visiting a gas station. The range questions, though, needed a challenge.

So we headed out from Toronto to Detroit, a 400-kilometre, cross-border journey.

After downloading an app showing charging stations, we had no problem plotting a route — there are hundreds in southern Ontario, though primarily in cities, and fast-chargers can take an EV to full charge in just over a half-hour.

Electric vehicle devotees had drilled into us the need to have a plan for a long trip, along with a backup plan in case a charging station was being used or broken upon our arrival. But we hadn't planned for human error.

The producer, videographer and I got chatting (office gossip, of course), and we missed our turnoff. It only took us about 15 km off our route, but it meant we couldn't make it to our intended charging station. Plan B took effect.

We ended up driving not to Windsor, Ont. — directly across from Detroit — but to Sarnia. And then the charger where we stopped, at a Tim Hortons, was slower than the two others we'd used. A lot slower. It took well over an hour and we didn't even fill up.

Trouble was, we had a meeting at the Detroit Auto Show and now there was no chance of making it.

We reached the border, welcomed by two U.S. border agents who joked about our battery on wheels. Then they spotted the TV equipment and off we went to secondary inspection. I'll spare you the boring bureaucratic details, but suffice to say, those guards drove our car around, then made us go back to Canada and return to the U.S.

It all cost us time and available range.

How do you extend the range in a pinch? Turn off the heat. All of it. Blowers, seat warmers, everything.

It boosted the range by 20 per cent, but meant we were all left freezing in an increasingly frosty car racing to Detroit with the –20 C temperatures seeping in.

Well, we made it. Just. Rolling in on fumes. (If the car had fumes.)

And then we saw it. Our car, but newer, on display at the auto show. And then the revelation: The 2020 model will have the range to make the same journey in one shot.

All a good reminder that many EVs still require planning for trips longer than a commute. But also that the batteries in newer models are getting much better — so you'll be able to leave the heat on while you drive!

""Whatever became of Mary Jane?"" asks Lloyd Robertson, as the ""concern and furor of the late 1960s"" gives way to the mellow mid-70s.

The beleaguered engineering and construction giant has been in the eye of a firestorm that erupted earlier this month when The Globe and Mail reported the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to steer prosecutors toward negotiations with the company. The company was looking to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with fraud and bribery charges linked to business dealings with Moammar Gadhafi’s now-toppled regime in Libya. Bruce said he wasn’t holding out much hope for a remediation agreement, which would allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a criminal trial in exchange for fines and other penalties.

“That’s certainly at their discretion,” he said. “But frankly, it doesn’t look like that today.” SNC-Lavalin chopped its dividend by 65 per cent Friday as it reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion. It will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share compared with its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share. Bruce said problems at a mining project in Chile were “incredibly disappointing,” noting the company’s mining and metallurgy and oil and gas segments had underperformed, prompting a pair of profit warnings earlier this year. Ongoing diplomatic tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia have jeopardized future contracts in the Middle Eastern kingdom, Bruce said last month after announcing a $1.24-billion impairment charge related to SNC-Lavalin’s oil and gas business.

The Jan. 28 announcement, combined with news about delays at the Chilean mining project and an arbitration loss in Australia, sent shares plummeting 27 per cent to close at $35.01, their lowest since September 2012. Analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities advised investors to “keep calm and carry on.”

“There remain lots of challenges ahead for SNC, but none of which we would view as insurmountable and more than reflected in the current share price,” he said in a research note Friday. A criminal case could result in a ban of up to 10 years on bidding on federal contracts. Bruce noted that until a conviction comes down, the company faces no bidding restrictions in Canada. “Basically, they don’t penalize you until you’re found guilty.” “This overhang continues to be there,” he added, “and competitors in the U.S … use that against us.” Analysts pointed to a potential sale of some of the company’s 16.77 per cent stake in Ontario’s 407 ETR highway in 2019. The company has been mulling a partial sale for at least six months, which would hand it a slice of the $2.2 billion some analysts say the stake is worth. The Montreal-based company’s loss for its fourth quarter amounted to $9.11 per diluted share. That compared with a profit of $52.4 million or 30 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue totalled $2.56 billion, down from $2.92 billion. On an adjusted basis, SNC reported a loss of $1.31 per diluted share compared with an adjusted profit of 98 cents per diluted share a year ago. Analysts on average had expected a loss of $1.19 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

It will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share compared with its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share. Bruce said problems at a mining project in Chile were “incredibly disappointing,” noting the company’s mining and metallurgy and oil and gas segments had underperformed, prompting a pair of profit warnings earlier this year. Ongoing diplomatic tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia have jeopardized future contracts in the Middle Eastern kingdom, Bruce said last month after announcing a $1.24-billion impairment charge related to SNC-Lavalin’s oil and gas business.

The Jan. 28 announcement, combined with news about delays at the Chilean mining project and an arbitration loss in Australia, sent shares plummeting 27 per cent to close at $35.01, their lowest since September 2012. Analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities advised investors to “keep calm and carry on.”

“There remain lots of challenges ahead for SNC, but none of which we would view as insurmountable and more than reflected in the current share price,” he said in a research note Friday. A criminal case could result in a ban of up to 10 years on bidding on federal contracts. Bruce noted that until a conviction comes down, the company faces no bidding restrictions in Canada. “Basically, they don’t penalize you until you’re found guilty.” “This overhang continues to be there,” he added, “and competitors in the U.S....use that against us.” Analysts pointed to a potential sale of some of the company’s 16.77 per cent stake in Ontario’s 407 ETR highway in 2019. The company has been mulling a partial sale for at least six months, which would hand it a slice of the $2.2 billion some analysts say the stake is worth. The Montreal-based company’s loss for its fourth quarter amounted to $9.11 per diluted share. That compared with a profit of $52.4 million or 30 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue totalled $2.56 billion, down from $2.92 billion. On an adjusted basis, SNC reported a loss of $1.31 per diluted share compared with an adjusted profit of 98 cents per diluted share a year ago. Analysts on average had expected a loss of $1.19 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

SNC-Lavalin, the Montreal construction a…","When City of Ottawa procurement staff three years ago began evaluating builders for the second stage of the transformative light rail project, they had no idea the time frame would coincide with a political earthquake.

SNC-Lavalin, the Montreal construction and engineering giant that’s been pushing relentlessly for a negotiated settlement to charges it bribed Libyan officials, was all along a strong contender. Not only does SNC-Lavalin hold a 40 per cent interest in Rideau Transit Group, the entity that is finishing up Phase 1, it has deep experience with these types of engineering projects.

The recent revelation that top Liberal and bureaucratic officials had allegedly tried to pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to permit a negotiated settlement with SNC-Lavalin was certainly noted by city staff, but it wasn’t enough to prompt a change of course. On Friday, they revealed SNC-Lavalin would be the key player to extend the Trillium Line to the airport, while Kiewit and Vinci were picked as the preferred bidders to build out the Confederation Line to points east and west. Total cost: $4.7 billion.

“SNC-Lavalin fully complied with the disclosure requirements of the request for quotations and request for proposals,” Chris Swail, director of the O-Train plan, told this newspaper. The company “disclosed both the investigations and charges facing the company and the remediation measures they had undertaken.”

At an earlier technical briefing Friday, Gloucester-Southgate Coun. Diane Deans disparaged this line of thinking, asking Swail if SNC-Lavalin’s legal position “could create a jeopardy for us and delay the project if they get into more trouble?”

Swail’s response was pointed: “Running a procurement process … is not about rewarding anyone,” he said. “It’s about running a process; whoever has the strongest bid within that process evaluation is the winner. That’s what we did, and there was no reason to prohibit anyone coming into this procurement process early on.”

Well, what about now? Is there a risk that a potential guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin would prompt the federal government down the road to strip away its portion of the $2.4 billion in federal-provincial funding that is underpinning LRT Phase 2?

Let’s put it this way: The risk of this happening is reduced on two fronts. First, this is a municipal matter and city staff have insisted on performance bonds and other types of guarantees that the work will be completed. While Swail wasn’t specific, he alluded to certain rights the city had retained to be able to step in and complete the project in the event of any builder’s insolvency.

And, while insolvency can’t be dismissed out of hand, SNC-Lavalin is a $10 billion-a-year company, which on Friday reported a 43 per cent jump in its revenue backlog to $14.9 billion. About one-quarter of the firm’s revenues are generated in Canada. Yes, the firm also revealed a big loss for the year, but most of this involved projects in Saudi Arabia, sideswiped by deteriorating relations with Canada. The write-down did not involve cash.

The second ameliorated risk has to do with the presumption of innocence. SNC-Lavalin said it intends to put up a strong defence against the fraud and corruption charges against it — and it is just possible the 2022 scheduled completion date for Ottawa’s Trillium Line extension will be in sight before there’s a final legal resolution.

SNC-Lavalin was charged four long years ago under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. This after a three-year investigation by the RCMP into whether certain SNC-Lavalin officials had bribed Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011 to obtain engineering and construction contracts.

The timing of the charges was no coincidence. The a new integrity regime had been introduced by Stephen Harper’s Conservatives to clean up foreign contracting and it contained a number of new penalties, such as the loss of the right to do business with the federal government for 10 years. Last September, the Liberals revised the criminal code to allow for the possibility of a negotiated settlement, allowing companies to avoid prosecution provided they cleaned up their act and paid some fines. This was done in part to avoid penalizing an entire company for the actions of a few individual employees.

When federal prosecutors declined to invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate, the Montreal firm launched a two-front assault. It hired lobbyists to try to convince the justice minister that the negotiated route was best, and — lost amid the politics — SNC-Lavalin prepared for a lengthy legal battle. In October, it challenged federal prosecutors’ decision not to negotiate a settlement. This, in turn, prompted the director of public prosecutions to file a motion aimed at striking down the challenge.

Final arguments for this motion are due on April 1. SNC-Lavalin warned in its quarterly financial statement, filed Friday, that depending on the outcome it “may seek further review.”

Then there’s the legal fight over the actual charges relating to Libyan contracts. It seems likely the trial won’t get underway until 2020, though late 2019 is still a possibility.

Even if there is a guilty verdict, thus triggering the penalties contemplated in the integrity regime, judicial appeals could stretch beyond 2021.

If all goes well on the LRT project, SNC-Lavalin should by then be just one year away from finishing up the Trillium Line contract — assuming it’s learned from the experience of the much delayed first phase of LRT.

That would make city staff very happy.

SNC is girding for a legal showdown in a case that has embroiled Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid reports that his office pressured the country’s former attorney general to intervene on the company’s behalf. Bruce is meanwhile grappling with a business crisis that has intensified during the last month with two profit warnings, a writedown in the company’s energy business and a credit downgrade by S&P Global Ratings. The legal battle will probably last “a number of years,” but SNC is confident it will get “the right outcome,” Bruce said. The shares fell 3.1 per cent to $34.71 at 3:40 p.m. in Toronto. Through Thursday, SNC had plunged 26 per cent since Jan. 25, the last trading day before the company disclosed a “serious problem” with a mining contract in Latin America and took a $1.24 billion charge on its energy business because of a diplomatic spat between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

Bribery Case The Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged SNC in 2015 with attempted bribery and fraud related to projects in Libya. The lack of an out-of-court settlement with Canada has probably cost SNC more than $5 billion in lost revenue and continues to damage its reputation, Bruce said in December. He wasn’t with the company when the Libyan allegations emerged.

Losing at trial could result in a potential 10-year ban on Canadian government contracts. Reports that Trudeau’s office pressed Jody Wilson-Raybould, the attorney general at the time, to end the legal case last year led to this week’s bombshell departure of Trudeau’s top aide. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet earlier this month. It’s still possible for SNC to receive a deferred prosecution agreement, Canada’s top bureaucrat said Thursday. SNC would “of course be a willing participant” if it were invited to negotiate a deal with Canadian prosecutors, Bruce said. But “frankly it doesn’t look like that today,” he said. Dividend Cut While the political scandal deepens, the CEO is also pushing to shore up the company’s finances. SNC cut its dividend for the first time in almost 27 years while reaffirming confidence in its top executives. The quarterly payout will tumble by about two-thirds to 10 cents a share from 28.7 cents with immediate effect, the Montreal-based builder said in a statement. The move will save SNC about $131 million a year in cash, which will be used to repay debt and provide “additional flexibility.’ “Given the potential cash requirements in the first half of 2019, we view the dividend reduction as a prudent move,” Derek Spronck, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. “There remains lots of challenges ahead for SNC, but none of which we would view as insurmountable and more than reflected in the current share price.” The SNC board “reiterates its confidence in the executive leadership team to move forward into 2019,” Chairman Kevin Lynch said in the statement. Highway Transaction SNC said it was progressing with the potential sale of part of its interest in Highway 407, a toll road near Toronto. The possible deal “could be in the form of a direct sale or another type of transaction,” SNC said. The company swung to a fourth-quarter adjusted loss of $1.62 a share from engineering and construction. Analysts had expected a shortfall of $1.61, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The profit measure will be $2 to $2.20 a share this year, SNC said. That compared with expectations of $2.08. SNC had about $634 million of cash and cash equivalents and about $2.3 billion of recourse debt as of Dec. 31. It also had $2.1 billion in unused borrowing capacity under a $2.6 billion revolving-credit facility.

442,Empty,2019-02-22T19:32:57Z,"Embattled construction group SNC-Lavalin has been selected as one of the recommend proponents to build Stage 2 of the city’s light-rail transit system, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson announced Friday. The announcement comes while SNC is at the centre of controversy …","City of Ottawa staff revealed Friday that Stage 2 LRT will arrive later and cost $1.2 billion more if council decides to endorse contracts with its preferred project proponents — one of which is the embattled construction group SNC-Lavalin.

At a Friday afternoon technical briefing, Mayor Jim Watson announced that, after a three-year procurement process, the city was recommending TransitNEXT, a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin, as the preferred proponent to work on the next phase of the north-south Trillium Line, which will see LRT extended to Riverside South and the Ottawa International Airport.

East West Connectors, a consortium comprised of American construction company Kiewit and French builder and transit operator Vinci, has been recommended for the design-build of the Confederation Line extension to Trim Road in the east, and Moodie Drive and Algonquin College in the west, while Confederation Line contractor RTG will remain responsible for the maintenance of the line.RTG had agreed not to bid on Stage 2.

The city believed a bid by RTG would have discouraged competition.It was revealed Friday that major elements of LRT Stage 2 had changed since staff last appeared in front of city council to talk about the project.Instead of 19 new stations and 30 km of new rail, the preferred proponents would build 24 stations along 44 km, bringing 77 per cent of Ottawa residents within five kilometres of the new LRT system.

The cost had also increased significantly, from a projected project total of $3.4 billion to more than $4.6 billion. Changes in scope — track extensions, additional escalators, station and signal upgrades — as well as market pressures such as increased costs for labour and materials had driven up the price tag, the city said.

The opening dates for all three sections of Stage 2 LRT were also delayed from initial estimates, from 2021 to 2022 for the Trillium Line, 2022 to 2024 for Confederation Line East and 2023 to 2025 for Confederation Line West.

The existing O-Train Trillium Line, which runs between Bayview and South Keys stations, would also close for nearly a year longer than originally planned. “When you’re doing a project that is as transformational as this … you have to get things right from the beginning,” said Chris Swail, director of the city’s O-Train planning office.

“What we have now are budgets and schedules that are backstopped with serious bids from proponents that are capable of delivering great projects, so this, in my mind, is the starting point. This project is worth $4.6 billion.”

According to Swail, both preferred proponents had the most economical bids in their respective groups competing for the Stage 2 LRT contracts.

He said the up-front investments that have in part prompted the price increase will pay for themselves in the long-term through maintenance savings. In the short-term, they will be financed by taking on more debt. Gloucester-Southgate Coun. Diane Deans was one of several city councillors at Friday’s briefing who expressed alarm at the scale of the changes to the project.

“I think we need to ask the public if they’re still on board,” she said. While Swail said councillors are welcome to engage with their constituents and pose any questions to the LRT team, the city is facing a hard and fast deadline to make a decision on proceeding with the project.

These bids have a validity period, he explained, meaning that in order to lock in contracts with the preferred proponents at the prices they’ve put on the table, the city needs council approval and funding agreements in place with the provincial and federal governments by the end of March.

“Otherwise, the costs that you’re concerned about are only going to go up, so we have to move quickly, unfortunately.“Swail said the province has indicated its intention to follow through on a $1-billion contribution to the project. In a statement to this newspaper, provincial Infrastructure Minister Monte McNaughton’s office wrote, “The province is currently reviewing all current projects and spending to ensure the government is positioned to provide quality and efficient transportation options to all Ontarians.”

East West Connectors is a corporate group assembled specifically for Ottawa work by companies Kiewit and Vinci, who’ve cut their LRT teeth on projects in Waterloo, Ont., and Qatar. TransitNEXT is also no newcomer to the LRT game, with SNC-Lavalin having played a major role in the development of Metro Vancouver’s Canada Line and light rail in Calgary.

The Montreal-based infrastructure giant is currently facing bribery and fraud charges related to payments allegedly made to Libyan officials to secure government contracts. Experts have said that conviction on the charges could mean the company would be barred from bidding on federal contracts for a decade.

The report on the Stage 2 LRT procurement will come before committee of the whole on Wednesday, where public delegates will be able to have their say.

City council will vote on it March 6.

Meanwhile, the first phase of the Confederation Line is supposed to be in the city’s hands come March 31, but officials all the way up to Transportation GM John Manconi have predicted yet another delay is coming.

On Friday, the city said it will be applying some hard-earned Stage 1 lessons to LRT Stage 2, including stronger penalties if “project completion notifications” are missed; a better idea of cost management; and “expanded mobility matters” to include pedestrians and cyclists. Swail said he doesn’t think Stage 2 LRT will see the same delays that continue to frustrate the city.

While the proponents would be able to adjust their project schedules provided they give the city more than 100 days notice, they’ll only be able to do so “for so long,” said Swail. After certain dates, penalties for delays will become much more severe, to the point that the city would be able to replace the contractor.

“We’re confident that they can meet these timelines, but in terms of the shifts that have happened in the opening of the Confederation Line without any penalties to the contractor, that’s not going to happen in either one of these contracts, moving forward,” he said.

What really matters is the city has performed its internal procedures, said Marc Tasse, a forensic accountant who teaches at the Telfer School of Management and an expert in fraud prevention and detection, money laundering prevention and anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance.

Tasse, who is a member of Transparency International’s Anti-Corruption Expert Network, said that, from his perspective, there’s no shadow on the city’s decision to name SNC-Lavalin as one of its recommended proponents to build Stage 2 of the city’s light-rail transit system.

“It doesn’t matter which company it is. The monitoring is what matters,” he said. “When you are in procurement, you shouldn’t feel any pressure from the public. The only thing that matters is that they are monitoring all the steps of the process.”

SNC-Lavalin has also created a robust integrity program, he said.

In 2012 and 2013, it launched a number of initiatives to reassure stakeholders of its commitment to ethics and compliance. The measures included compliance training for all employees and an amnesty program that gave employees an opportunity to come forward with ethical violations issues. A total of 32 employees made amnesty requests.

Among the questions that employees should ask themselves about any work-related actions or decisions is, “How would it look if it were reported on the news or in another public forum?” according to the company’s 2019 edition of the Code of Conduct.

“There was a change of culture. They had allocated the money to do this, they have added integrity officers. They have people who are really good at what they do,” said Tasse.

“We shouldn’t rely on the name of the company, but if they have a compliance program. Right now, I would say that they have one of the leading integrity programs in the field.”

Meanwhile, Tasse also has confidence in the city’s processes.

“Procurement agents are pretty sharp,” he said. “And the City of Ottawa has an auditor general who will watch it very carefully.”

The city’s auditor general is Ken Hughes, who works independently of city administration and reports to city council. Hughes has worked in areas including fraud investigation and internal control review.

The allegations that have swirled around SNC-Lavalin will likely even be helpful to the managers who are monitoring the project.

“Once there are allegations, you know exactly what to watch for,” said Tasse. “There’s a high risk in what you don’t know.”

Christie Stephenson, the executive director of the Peter P. Dhillon Centre for Business Ethics at theUniversity of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, said she can’t comment on SNC-Lavalin. But, more and more, reputation is a business risk, she said.



Timing is an important factor in that risk, and stakeholders’ expectations that companies will reflect ethical standards is on the rise, she said. It takes a long time to build a reputation, but it can crumble quickly.



“At the end of the day, all of the programs and policies don’t matter unless there’s a culture and a leadership,” she said.

445,Empty,2019-02-22T18:03:47Z,"Proposed new rules are big change from current policy, which mandates automatic 10-year suspension for any corporation that violates Integrity Regime","A government agency is proposing changes to an obscure policy that could help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., the embattled-Montreal engineering and construction firm, move past a national political scandal and survive any potential federal conviction on looming fraud charges.

Public Services and Procurement Canada is reviewing and finalizing changes to the ‘Ineligibility and Suspension Policy’ under the Integrity Regime — which governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects. The proposed changes would give the government greater discretion to decide on whether a ban makes sense, and if so, an appropriate length of time.

Under current policy, SNC faces a possible 10-year ban from bidding on federal projects if convicted on charges it sent tens of millions of dollars in bribes and gifts to Libyan officials, including the son of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi, to win lucrative contracts in that country. Because the giant engineering and construction firm derives significant revenue from federally funded infrastructure projects, any ban could have crippling consequences.

The media relations office of the PSPC said the updated policy is “being studied and finalized” and acknowledged there was no minimum period of suspension mandated under the proposed changes.

That could provide SNC-Lavalin — whose efforts to settle its criminal charges have led to a national furor about whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould — an alternative way to escape the potentially debilitating effects on its infrastructure business that a conviction would bring.

“Theoretically, they could propose … that ineligibility be six months, a year or no debarment at all,” said Timothy Cullen, an Ottawa-based lawyer at McMillan, about the proposed changes. “Whether they (the government) will feel that’s appropriate, we don’t know because it’s never been done before.”

Cullen, who advises corporate clients on the government procurement process, said a contact in the registrar’s office of Public Services and Procurement Canada suggested enactment of the changes is imminent.

A draft of the proposed changes was released several months ago, and they were scheduled to take effect in January, he added. Although the proposed changes could face further revisions, Cullen said it is likely the draft will not feature any substantial changes.

If so, it marks a significant change from the current policy, which mandates an automatic 10-year suspension for any corporation that violates the Integrity Regime, which could be reduced under certain circumstances to five years.

Some lawyers said there may have been ways to negotiate with the registrar and find loopholes to reduce a 10-year, or even five-year penalty, but the perception of the policy has been that it was inflexible.

“It was very much intended to be a strict regime,” said Gerry Stobo, a procurement lawyer with Cassidy Levy Kent. “If you were convicted of one of the (qualifying) offences, the government of Canada would not be doing business with you.”

Records indicate that SNC lobbied Public Services and Procurement Canada, including assistant deputy minister Barbara Glover eight times between 2016 and 2017, although no detail is provided about the substance of these meetings.

It was very much intended to be a strict regime Gerry Stobo, procurement lawyer with Cassidy Levy Kent

The company is the only entity that currently has an administrative agreement with PSPC that allows it to continue bidding and working on federal contracts despite the pending charges against it.

SNC-Lavalin declined to comment for this article.

Lawyers who practice in the procurement area said corporate suppliers have long expressed concerns that the current debarment and ineligibility system is inflexible in that it automatically mandates 10-year suspensions.

PSPC initiated a public consultation on its ‘Ineligibility and Suspension Policy’ in the fall of 2017, and incorporated feedback such as the need for “greater flexibility in debarment decisions” in its proposed changes.

The proposed changes have other effects, including to widen the scope of what can lead to debarment to include human trafficking, environmental crimes and labour violations.

Still, it would mark the second recent change in policy or law, which could potentially help SNC-Lavalin, one of Canada’s oldest and largest companies, as it battles the fallout from its overseas bribery scandal.

Last May, a provision added to the federal budget enabled prosecutors to strike a remediation agreement with corporations. In essence, it allows prosecutors to defer prosecuting companies that can show over an extended period of time that they have rooted out the causes of the crime. This means the companies may need to acknowledge culpability, make retributions, install corporate compliance monitors and remove individuals linked to the crime.

Earlier this month, a scandal erupted after the Globe and Mail reported the Prime Minister’s Office had pressured Wilson-Raybould to abandon charges against SNC-Lavalin and instead pursue a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould was moved to another ministry and, subsequently, resigned from cabinet.

The result of a bar from bidding on federal projects could be crippling for SNC-Lavalin, though probably not a death blow: Last October, the company announced a remediation agreement was not likely.

Afterwards, Devin Dodge, a BMO analyst, noted about 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017 derived from the Canadian government fall within the company’s infrastructure business. The risk of a guilty verdict and the resulting 10-year debarment, plus any fines, creates “a significant burden” on the value of the segment, he wrote, estimating its enterprise value at between $276 million and $414 million.

But its other business segments, including its nuclear facilities maintenance, mining and metallurgy, oil and gas and others could also suffer from a finding that the company violated Canada’s Integrity Regime.

“The fact that we’ve not been invited to negotiate a remediation agreement makes no sense,” Neil Bruce, chief executive of SNC-Lavalin, wrote in a letter to shareholders last October.

He argued that because a corporation cannot be put in jail, the prosecution of SNC will only hurt the company’s 9,000 employees in Canada who may lose their jobs if the company is convicted. Instead, he argued prosecutors should target the individuals involved in the alleged bribes, which took place between 2001 and 2012.

“The truth is, the events prior to 2012 that led to the federal charges should have never taken place,” Bruce wrote.

The arguments apparently did not persuade prosecutors who continue to move the case closer to trial. Whether the changes Bruce argued have taken place at the company will satisfy government officials responsible for deciding who can bid on contracts remains open, if the proposed changes to the Integrity Regime are enacted.

The Guardian is going to keep me very busy in the next few days; it is Concrete Week, which ""celebrates the aesthetic and social achievements of concrete, while investigating its innumerable harms, to learn what we can all do today to bring about a less grey world."" This is going to be bigger than Shark Week as they start with the innumerable harms, with Jonathan Watts' article Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth. The first paragraph is scary:

In the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China’s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England.

It gets worse. We are complaining a lot about plastic, but there are only 8 billion tonnes of it since it was invented; that much concrete is made every two years. We have often complained here about the Carbon Dioxide emitted by concrete, but Watts covers all the ancillary issues that don't get noticed as much (although I am proud to say that we have covered most of them on TreeHugger).

There is silicosis from breathing concrete dust.

There are the killer trucks delivering concrete through cities.

There is the sand mining that is ""catastrophic – destroying so many of the world’s beaches and river courses that this form of mining is now increasingly run by organised crime gangs and associated with murderous violence.""

But a very interesting byproduct of concrete is how it affects politics.

The politics of concrete are less divisive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high.

Watts goes on to talk about Japan, but one need look no farther than Canada, where the government is consumed right now with the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which there are questions of whether Prime Minister Trudeau tried to protect the nation's largest international pourer of concrete. It could bring down the government.

Watts concludes with a quote from Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, who makes a case for concrete: “The raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation.”

But the raw materials are not limitless; we are running out of sand and fresh water. We have to rethink our need for more concrete roads and more underground parking garages and more tall concrete buildings. We have to stop using so much of the stuff.","Is concrete ""the most destructive material on Earth""?",Treehugger.com,https://www.treehugger.com/infrastructure/concrete-most-destructive-material-earth.html
447,Empty,2019-02-22T22:19:18Z,David Moscrop: The Privy Council clerk's soliloquy—though not objectively wrong—sowed confusion and suspicion of partisanship. Isn't that what he's trying to stop? The post Michael Wernick should’ve thought twice before serving up his ‘Cicero moment’ appeared…,"While much of the country is going about its day-to-day business, the SNC-Lavalin/Jody Wilson-Raybould affair has overtaken Ottawa and the front pages of newspapers throughout Canada. A complicated matter of ethics and law, of dates and times and personalities, of partisan games and media speculation, the knotty issue has become a matter in the public interest that must be unraveled as soon as possible. To that end, the House of Commons Committee on Justice and Human Rights is investigating the government’s consideration of a deferred prosecution agreement for the engineering firm.

On Thursday, the committee called Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick—the nation’s top bureaucrat, deputy minister to the prime minister, and secretary to the cabinet—to testify about who said what to whom about SNC-Lavalin, when they said it, and why. That makes sense. Wernick is a longtime, respected public servant whose time in government stretches back decades and includes service under Liberal and Conservative prime ministers. And as the chief of the Privy Council Office, which acts as the civil service support organization for the prime minister and cabinet, he would have been a part of discussions about what the attorney general can and cannot do in such matters as a deferred prosecution agreement and, equally, what Trudeau and his office can and cannot ask her to do. So far, nothing to see here.

In the 4th century B.C.E., Aristotle talked about phronesis. It means wisdom, more or less. But the ancient Greek philosopher built out the concept in a particular way, casting it as what we call practical wisdom, or doing the right thing, the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons. You might say that practical wisdom is concerned with how to act in good ways. It’s a useful concept and one we’d do well to apply in our personal and professional lives as much as possible. In fact, the health of our democratic institutions and the public sphere might depend on it.

Wernick’s testimony included references to extreme partisanship, the dangers of shouting treason and incitation to violence, and the decline of democratic institutions at home and abroad. He even worried aloud that someone might be shot as aggravating political rhetoric pierces our civic discourse. He’s not wrong. Nor is he a partisan, as some are suggesting, despite unnecessary and over-the-top praise for the current government. Moreover, it seems that his point is that these concerns may be related to the SNC-Lavalin affair through the cynical and hyperbolic politicization of the matter. But here’s where things turn.

To the extent that Canadians are even aware of Wernick and the position of clerk of the Privy Council, they tend to think that the duties of that office should be carried out quietly and without great drama. Ditto for other officials and public servants. Thankfully, in Canada, the public service is professional and it is typically non-partisan. It’s also world-class. But if public servants or officials are in the news, then there’s probably something wrong. The consensus seems to be that we ought to let politicians grandstand, to let members of Parliament be the story, to let the folks we vote for act as our pace cars or guides, and—finally—to let elected representatives be held accountable. Wernick’s testimony seemed to violate that expectation at very much the wrong time, thus adding fuel to what’s already a raging national dumpster fire.

As correct and important as Wernick’s opening statement to the committee and subsequent testimony was, his Cicero act—heavy rhetorical flourishes in the stately spirit of the ancient politician and orator—while both understandable and laudable in its presumed ends, didn’t live up to the standard of practical wisdom that our officials and public servants should keep. What Canadians need right now is facts. Boring. Dry. Plain. Direct. Facts. As much as those in the public spotlight might want to cry, with justification, O tempora o mores! (Oh the times! Oh the customs!) in observation of the SNC-Lavalin mess, a committee investigation into a sensitive and complicated matter is neither the time nor the place. Once more, it isn’t that such observations are wrong; it’s that they’re not helpful and they probably won’t achieve their desired ends—and they risk making matters worse by sowing confusion and misplaced suspicions of partisan motivation that undermine the goals of their speaker.

Even as Wernick spoke, his words were already becoming a Rorschach test for partisans and others following his testimony who saw the worst—or the most tactically advantageous—in what he said. Sadly, that fact is evidence that what he laments is indeed a problem. But wise officials and public servants ought to take a moment to consider the best way for them to support healthier public discourse and a safe and productive public sphere—and that’s by locking it down and choosing their words with extraordinary but essential care.
