But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

She cited four occasions on which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or senior aides—even Canada’s top civil servant—brought up a forthcoming election (Quebec’s or their own) during a discussion of a potential deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, which Wilson-Raybould did not support.

From her explosive half-hour opening statement:

Sept. 6, 2018: Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, to Jessica Prince, Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

Sept. 16: Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques, senior advisors to the Prime Minister, to Jessica Prince

They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here. They told her that SNC’s next board meeting is on Thursday (Sept 20). They also mention the Quebec election context.

Sept. 17: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to Wilson-Raybould

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise—the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA—he said ‘there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders’ … ‘they will likely be moving to London if this happens’… ‘and there is an election in Quebec soon’…

At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘and I am an MP in Quebec—the member for Papineau.’

I was quite taken aback. My response—and I remember this vividly—was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye—I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The Prime Minister said, ‘No, no, no—we just need to find a solution.’

Oct. 26: Mathieu Bouchard to Jessica Prince

My COS (chief of staff) said that this would obviously be perceived as interference and her boss questioning the DPP’s decision. Mathieu said that if—six months from the election—SNC announces they are moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.

After the prime minister told ruling party supporters that unofficial results showed Sall winning 57 per cent of Sunday's vote, top opponents dismissed the claim and told supporters to prepare for a runoff election.

Election observers reported finding no major irregularities during the presidential vote. In their joint statement, the opposition candidates said they still rejected the election's outcome, but added, ""We will not be taking any recourse at the constitutional council.""

The tally was announced on live TV and radio, a rarity in a part of the world where postelection violence is common in many countries. There were scattered reports of protests, including by university students in Dakar.

Police said some protesters hit a gas station in Thies, and officers intervened. But no as before police put down the unrest. But there were no large demonstrations after Sall was declared the election's winner.

""President Macky finished first in 12 of Senegal's 14 regions,"" former Prime Minister Aminata Toure told her fellow Sall supporters outside the party's headquarters in the capital of Dakar. ""The gap between him and the other candidates is big.""

The incumbent received 58.3 per cent of the vote, according to Judge Demba Kandji, president of the commission tasked with releasing the election results. Provisional results showed that top opposition candidate Idrissa Seck took 20.5 per cent of the vote, while Ousmane Sonko had 15.7 per cent.

The 57-year-old Sall campaigned on his record of building roads and creating jobs, calling himself ""the builder of modern Senegal."" The president maintains he created some 491,000 jobs during his first term.

Opposition supporters maintained that Sall's economic accomplishments still had not reached many citizens of a country where young men often risk their lives migrating to Europe in search of better prospects.

""Macky Sall is obsessed with infrastructure and he's not concerned with employment, with employing my generation,"" said Abdou Camara, 24, a Seck supporter who is applying to graduate school in Canada after trying to find a job for six months. ""I don't hate Macky Sall, but I can't love him.""

Senegal has long been a democratic example in West Africa, where leaders clinging to power and new governments taking power through coups once were all too common

However, the presidential race this year brought allegations that the presidency effectively blocked two prominent opposition politicians from taking part, Dakar's former mayor and the son of the president Sall defeated in 2012.

During the campaign that resulted in his first term, Sall promoted a message of change to beat longtime President Abdoulaye Wade. A constitutional referendum since then has shortened the presidential term from seven years to five.

After the change, Sall weathered some criticism by deciding to complete a seven-year term.

But given that some of them ...,"I am against the federal government’s Critical Election Incident Public Protocol (CEIPP) in principle. But given the up-to-his-eyeballs involvement of Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick in the prime minister’s efforts to pressure former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould into ending the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, I now have very practical objections to the CEIPP, too.

In early February, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould announced that five senior civil servants will monitor the Internet for any sign of foreign meddling during this fall’s federal election.

Gould insisted this was not about “refereeing the election.” Rather, the CEIPP was about “alerting Canadians of an incident that jeopardizes their rights to a free and fair election.”

Okay, some giant hack of voting results that changed the outcome in several ridings might qualify, but Gould instead said the Liberals’ main concern was stopping “fake news” and “orchestrated disinformation campaigns.”

That’s a whole different kettle of fish. That sounds like an attempt to monitor the issues voters can and cannot see during an election.

That’s not a conspiratorial fear on my part. Canadian law already makes it very difficult for any group other than registered political parties to advertise their views during a campaign. Since the internet offers these “third parties” a powerful new way to get around the politicians’ advertising monopoly, is it that hard to believe the government would try to regulate Internet and social media in the name of “fairness” and use “fake news” as their excuse?

The key to the CEIPP’s objectivity, then, is who sits on it. And that is where my practical concern comes in.

I was already worried about the objectivity of Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick before Wilson-Raybould’s testimony this week at the Commons Justice committee.

In his own testimony last week, Wernick exclaimed that he was “deeply concerned about my country now, its politics, and where it’s headed.”

His main concern was “the rising tides of incitements to violence when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’,” directed at public figures such as the prime minister. Wernick added, “Those are the words that lead to assassination.”

No one on the committee had asked him about this. It seemed evident he was simply trying to distract the committee from it real purpose, namely SNC-Lavalin.

Wernick did not say specifically that he was worried about the “yellow vests” who had driven their oilfield service trucks from western Canada to Ottawa that week. But given that some of them had displayed placards with the words “traitor” and “treason” on them, it was not hard to figure out who Wernick meant.

And if he cannot distinguish between frustrated people letting off steam by using exaggeration and real conspirators plotting to commit crimes, then Wernick has no business being named as one of the five impartial monitors of our upcoming federal campaign.

He also has no business being put in charge of election fairness if, in his judgement, a bunch of oil patch workers are a greater threat to Canadian democracy than an orchestrated effort by the Prime Minister’s Office to undermine our federal justice system on behalf of a Liberal-friendly corporation and on behalf of Liberal party re-election hopes.

Worse yet, since Wernick’s own credibility-shattering testimony, Canadians have heard from Wilson-Raybould herself. If her testimony is accurate, Wernick is also guilty of serving as a surrogate for the PM in pressuring Wilson-Raybould to get a deal done for SNC or face personal political consequences (such as being demoted in cabinet, which she was).

Wernick is supposed to be entirely non-partisan. Entirely. Given his entanglement in the SNC affair, he probably shouldn’t keep his main job, but he definitely can’t keep his post as an impartial monitor of this fall’s campaign.",GUNTER: Michael Wernick's the last person who should be monitoring election fairness,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-michael-wernicks-the-last-person-who-should-be-monitoring-election-fairness

The executive, including Atallah, had wanted the meeting to be a general discussion on the future ...","QUEBEC — Antoine Atallah, president of the Quebec Liberal Party, has resigned from his post citing the need for unity.

After a week of media reports of internal dissent over his leadership, Atallah called it quits Friday, publishing a long letter of resignation on his personal Facebook page.

Off the top he says the October election, which saw the Liberals lose power to the Coalition Avenir Québec, did not end the way he wanted it to and he assumes his share of the blame.

He does not address the controversy over his leadership directly except to say that, in his mind, the party needs unity and he considers his job reforming the structures of the 150-year-old party complete.

But he says some of the reforms put in place have rendered the party “extremely bureaucratic,” making it difficult for a volunteer officer like himself to put in place a real vision.

Radio-Canada, however, reported Friday that the Liberal caucus of elected MNAs itself asked for Atallah’s resignation.

His resignation follows a tumultuous meeting last weekend in Bécancour of the party’s 125 riding presidents where a rift emerged over how fast to proceed with a leadership race to replace Philippe Couillard, who resigned after the 2018 election defeat.

The executive, including Atallah, had wanted the meeting to be a general discussion on the future of the Liberal Party but a group of riding presidents spoke in favour of a speedier leadership process.

Some said it is hard for the party to go about the business of developing a new program without knowing the vision of the new leader.

The party, for example, just opted to stick with its traditional position on no restrictions on religious symbols despite the fact some believe taking a harder line might be a way to woo more nationalist votes back to the party.

Faced with the revolt, party interim leader Pierre Arcand announced the leadership race rules would be revealed at a meeting of the party general council May 4-5 in Drummondville.

On Friday, Arcand issued a statement thanking Atallah, who got involved in the party at age 17 and is now 32, for his years of service to the party.

He added the party’s current vice-president, Katherine Martin, will act as party president in the interim until the Liberal executive decides who will replace Atallah.

Atallah is the second big party name to step down in the wake of the election defeat. Businessman Alexandre Taillefer, who acted as party election campaign chairman, quit politics altogether after the vote.

The field of potential Liberal leadership candidates recently narrowed.

MP Murray Rankin, the party’s justice critic and one of its senior caucus members, announced Thursday that he won’t seek re-election this year ... tasked with overseeing Canada’s security and intelligence agencies. Rankin joins a growing ...","OTTAWA — The federal NDP is losing another member of its team just days after Leader Jagmeet Singh finally won a seat in the House of Commons in a make-or-break byelection.

B.C. MP Murray Rankin, the party’s justice critic and one of its senior caucus members, announced Thursday that he won’t seek re-election this year. His decision brings to 12 the number of NDP MPs elected in 2015 who aren’t running again — more than a quarter of the caucus.

“After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice,” he told the National Post in an interview. “It’s been the most exciting and rewarding thing I’ve ever done, working as an MP … But in terms of my life, I think it’s time to let someone else take the reins and I think this is a good time to do it.”

Rankin said he “absolutely” supports Singh’s leadership, and said he hopes the party is on an “upward incline” since Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday with 39 per cent of the vote.

“We had, I think, a very significant turnaround in the NDP fortunes when the leader won so convincingly in Burnaby South,” he said. “I think a lot of Canadians are now going to say we have a leader … who connects well with voters. We just have to get him into the House and get him better known by Canadians.”

After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice

Rankin, a lawyer who previously worked as a treaty negotiator for the province of B.C., was elected as the MP for Victoria in a 2012 byelection. He is the party’s justice critic and co-chair of the House of Commons justice committee, which is currently investigating allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deal with engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Rankin suggested the SNC-Lavalin controversy presents an opportunity for the NDP. “We have a situation unfolding in Ottawa that is going to give a lot of Canadians pause about the nature of the Liberal government, the government they thought was going to be a very different government,” he said.

In 2017, Rankin was also named to the national security committee of parliamentarians, tasked with overseeing Canada’s security and intelligence agencies.

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have decided not to seek another term. Of the 44 MPs elected in 2015, 12 have now announced they won’t run again, including Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Alberta’s lone NDP MP, Linda Duncan. A few more caucus members have yet to make their decisions public, including senior B.C. MP Nathan Cullen.

Singh has faced major hurdles since he won the party leadership in October 2017, including poor fundraising numbers and disappointing byelection results. Initially claiming he was comfortable without a seat in the House of Commons, he eventually changed his mind and decided to run in Burnaby. But his victory there was tempered by the loss of the Montreal riding of Outremont in a separate byelection on the same day, a seat held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007.

Rankin said it can be a “hard slog” for opposition MPs trying to make an impact in Ottawa. “The lot of an opposition politician isn’t always a happy one,” he said. “We do make differences … but sometimes being in an opposition role is not always gratifying.”

Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative to help guide talks in a new reconciliation process with the hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en nation, whose opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline through their traditional territory led to a showdown with the RCMP in January. He has accepted the position without pay.

“I simply want to do other things after this amount of time,” he said. “I think a lot of people would realize that going back and forth to Ottawa regularly, nine hours door-to-door, isn’t the most joyful experience, and maybe I can do other things at this stage of my career.”

The gross domestic product (GDP) figure was lower than the 1.0 percent expected by analysts, following 2.0 percent growth in the previous quarter.

This slowing pace closed out the year with a total annualized economic growth rate of 1.8 percent, slightly more than half the previous year’s 3.0 percent and the United States’s 2.9 percent growth in 2018.

“The ‘R’ word (for recession) will be on minds as Canada’s economy barely skirted the start of a recession in Q4,” CIBC Capital Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in a research note.

He pointed to a “weak handoff” from December to the new year, that he said will likely prompt the Bank of Canada to back off plans to raise interest rates in the short term.

“If not for a huge employment gain in January (+67,000 jobs) we’d be worried about an outright recession, but at this point, its best described as a stalled engine,” Shenfeld concluded.

Either scenario is bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals as they head into elections in October looking to hold onto their parliamentary majority.

The Trudeau Liberals’ popularity slipped amid allegations by his former attorney general of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign.

For the first time, the ruling Liberal Party has found itself trailing the opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer in the most recent public opinion polls.

Statistics Canada said the nation’s slowing economic growth mainly reflected a drop in investment spending and lower exports.

Household spending slowed for a second consecutive quarter, with spending on life insurance and financial services up and on motor vehicles down.

Purchases of cannabis — after recreational use was legalized in October — totalled Can$5.9 billion (US$4.5 billion) or 0.5 percent of household spending.

Business investment on non-residential structures, and machinery and equipment fell sharply, but that plunge was moderated by an uptick in investment in intellectual property products.

The latter was “mainly attributable to mineral exploration and evaluation, which can be influenced by anticipated prices and potential new reserves,” said Statistics Canada.

Exports volumes edged down, led by lower exports of forestry products, building and packaging materials, metal and non-metallic minerals, and energy products.

Imports also fell on lower shipments of industrial chemicals, plastic and rubber products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal and non-metallic mineral products.

Imports of energy products were flat while aircraft, engines and parts rebounded a whopping 17.1 percent. —AFP",Canada economy slowed at end of 2018 raising recession fears,aaj.tv,http://www.aaj.tv/2019/03/canada-economy-slowed-at-end-of-2018-raising-recession-fears/

Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country’s three leaders – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.

The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.

Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.

Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.

The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada’s dissatisfaction about last August’s Mexican side deal with the country’s new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization’s Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

“We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,” Nault said in an interview.

Nault said he was concerned about “the way it unfolded at the end,” and a perception “that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico.” He said that represented a break from “what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn’t overtake us.”

The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.

“I think it’s getting better,” Nault said this week of the relationship. “Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.”

Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico’s deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.

“That was part of the negotiation process … right now, it’s over,” de la Mora said in an interview.

“The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.”

The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.

De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico’s top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.

Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn’t begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country’s lawmakers.

During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador’s team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.

“We were not involved in that decision at all,” de la Mora said.

“If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.”

She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.

Among them, there’s this: we can never quite beat their political drama.

On Wednesday, however, Canada might have done it. While the testimony of Donald Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, transfixed the world, the reports originating out of an entirely different committee meeting in Ottawa may have been more scandalous.

Canada has always presented a good front of house: prim, stoic, orderly and well-managed. The kitchen is ankle-deep in grime and in dire need of pest control, but the backroom is easy to hide from happy patrons.

The scandal now unfolding in Ottawa – concerning just how far Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government was willing to go to save iconic Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin – is giving us all a peek behind that grubby little counter. It’s showing us what this country really is and for whom it actually runs.

According to Jody Wilson-Raybould – who confirmed the reporting by The Globe and Mail – the former justice minister and attorney-general “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion ... in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,"" she said in dramatic, hours-long testimony in front of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights on Wednesday. A DPA would allow the company to forgo a criminal trial for bribery for projects in Libya in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing and a fine.

Crass partisan electoral gain seemed to be at least the undertone of these conversations, she said. Occasionally it was even an overtone: One PMO staffer noted that SNC-Lavalin was threatening to move its headquarters from Montreal to a more congenial location abroad ahead of the federal election this fall, allegedly saying that “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.”

She said she felt that pressure over a number of months until the end of 2018, when Ms. Wilson-Raybould was suddenly demoted and replaced in her high-profile cabinet post by a member of Parliament from Montreal.

Mr. Trudeau delivered a brief statement on Wednesday night in Montreal, disagreeing with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We of course had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions,” he said.

No doubt, that focus will be welcome in some corners. But it should be noted that Mr. Trudeau is not the great defender of Canadian jobs, writ large, here.

He’s defending certain jobs. Not jobs in Oshawa, or northern Alberta, or Newfoundland – no, no, how quaint. Mr. Trudeau is passionate about the jobs that give lustre to a company that stands at the very firmament of the central Canadian elite, headquartered in a province with enormous psychological and electoral significance for the Liberals.

SNC-Lavalin provides the right sort of jobs, being the kind of company that knows the right sort of people: that is, the kind who can make a call that gets answered at the PMO.

One of these meetings about SNC-Lavalin took place with Mr. Trudeau himself, according to Ms. Wilson-Raybould: “At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec ... 'and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” She says she responded: “Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision, as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.”

“No, no, no,"" he allegedly said – ""we just need to find a solution.”

And all this, to save what? A company that has been mired in corruption scandals, both domestic and international, for decades. The World Bank Group blacklisted SNC-Lavalin and more than 100 of its affiliates for 10 years, meaning that Canadian businesses now dominate the bank’s list of companies sanctioned for fraud or corruption.

Now, a report from La Presse alleges that SNC-Lavalin paid tens of thousands of dollars for the services of prostitutes and naked dancers to entertain the son of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi during a tour of Canada in 2008.

Even Liberal die-hards aren’t really trying to defend this. The only recourse is this anemic plea for jobs, or to assure themselves that the Conservatives would be worse, probably.

It’s not hard to detect the nihilistic shrug behind all of this, though. This is the way it’s done – the way things have always been done. That’s how the country really runs. This is who it is run for.

Once you assure yourselves that the Other Guys would probably do the same, you’ve handed the Liberals, the “natural governing party of Canada,” the license to get away with anything.

And then they get away with everything.

Even though Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony didn’t involve porn-star hush-money or a convicted felon hurling broadsides at the sitting U.S. president, that revelation might just shock you even more.

Posters are plastering the walls, self-important student politicians are interrupting you on your way to class and there’s a guy standing in the front of your economics lecture dressed like Woody from Toy Story. It feels like the first snow of winter.

We love the Students’ Union election, which is one of the reasons why we make this supplement that you’re currently reading. Just like how all these folks are passionate about serving the student body and bringing change to campus — or getting that sweet resumé line — we’re passionate about informing students about who’s running, what they want to do if they’re elected and how likely it is that they’ll actually get those things done.

On Family Day weekend, we compiled a panel of our staff, cleaned the office, put on some nice clothes for once and interviewed (almost) every executive and Board of Governor representative candidate in this year’s SU election. Each interview follows the same format: We give each candidate up to five minutes to pitch their platform, then spend 10 minutes asking them questions. After that, we write up these little profiles to help inform students about the crowd of candidates.

There’s a number of pressing issues at the forefront of this year’s election, but the biggest theme is change. Upcoming provincial and federal elections could mean significant political shake-ups both in Alberta and throughout Canada. Plus, new University of Calgary president Ed McCauley is settling into his job. If there’s any time to push for change external to the SU, it’s now.

Beyond that, issues surrounding Open Educational Resources, Bermuda Shorts Day, MacHall redevelopment, policy reform, long-term financial stability for the SU, mental health and sexual violence are all central to one or more of the contested positions in this election. These are things that affect all students and SU elections have a significant impact on how those issues are handled. It’s your electoral duty to elect competent officials to represent you. Take that responsibility seriously.

In addition to the elected positions, this year also has a referendum for increasing the SU Volunteer Services fee from $0.75 to $1.50 for full-time students per semester. You can read our thoughts about that in our editorial at the front of this supplement. We’ll also have news coverage of the referendum throughout the campaign period online at thegauntlet.ca.

Don’t just read our candidate profiles and endorsements. Read the candidates’ submitted platforms on the SU website, attend some forums — or the Gauntlet’s presidential debate, taking place Feb. 28 at 2 p.m. in

And make sure to vote through your myUofC student centre from March 5–7, ya turkeys.

Vice President Student Life

The vice-president student life is in charge of student clubs, events like Orientation Week, Frostbite and Bermuda Shorts Day, as well as mental health and overall student wellness initiatives. Pick a candidate who understands all parts of the portfolio and is enthusiastic about campus life.

Alisha Gordon

“I want to help develop a more accessible, diverse and inclusive campus community.”

Alisha Gordon is acclaimed as vice-president student life. That being said, she is an excellent fit for the role, having served as an elected student-at-large senate representative for two terms as well as in various committee roles on campus.

Gordon has plenty of experience with student clubs and her passion for their role in student life comes through in her platform.

Gordon is well-versed in the student life portfolio and knows her platform inside out. Her strongest platform point involves engaging with student clubs to increase awareness of the SU, provide better access to conference and event spaces and streamline workshops such as ClubHub101 to make sure they are interactive and meet the needs of club executives.

Mental health is another strong component of Gordon’s platform. She wants to ensure that there are more culturally diverse resources for mental health and that professionals on campus are capable of taking a trauma-informed approach to mental health, something she feels is currently lacking. Ensuring students feel safe in The Den and that staff receive bystander intervention training is one of her concerns. Gordon also wants to expand on her predecessor’s Stress Buster workshops to ensure they work with clubs’ stress-less initiatives, rather than competing with them.

The weakest portion of Gordon’s platform is her understanding of the way the Dining Centre operates. She feels the current system is exploitative and encourages unhealthy eating habits with the ‘all-you-care-to-eat’ program. Gordon means well in this area but should work on fleshing out concrete ideas and solutions to the various issues that exist with the Dining Centre’s meal plans. Gordon also hopes to work closely with Dinos Athletics to increase attendance at sporting events. She should create a concrete plan for this as well.

Overall, Gordon is a competent, passionate advocate for student life. We don’t love acclamations, but we can’t complain that it’s Gordon who got the role.

bElections mean a lot to the resource industry — governments can make life easy or a lot harder depending on which way the polls go.

The last few years of elections around the world have been all about disruption — from Brexit and Trump — to consolidation — with both Putin in Russia and Xinping in China solidifying their holds on power.

Here, the Investing News Network (INN) takes a look at some of the elections coming up in 2019 that investors with an interest in the resource industry would do well to take note of — notably Australia, South Africa and the Philippines. Read part 1 of this series here.

From last week’s list, Nigeria just went to the polls, with incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari re-elected, though his opponent rejects the results.

As Africa’s largest oil producer and an OPEC founding member, Nigeria’s results were watched by major oil companies and export destinations around the world. Turnout was low, and the divide between the north, and the oil-rich south of the country is prominent as the south voted for Buhari’s challenger.

For now, let’s take a look at the next bunch of elections on the medium-term horizon.

Australia — Federal Election (Estimated May 2019)

In the land down under, it’s looking like a change of government may be on the horizon if the polls are to be believed. Australia’s current Prime Minister has been in the job since August last year after yet another leadership change — something Canberra has become famous for since 2010.

Australia is a nation built on mining, with major and historical projects across each of its states — it’s the home of mining giants BHP (ASX:BHP,NYSE:BHP,LSE:BLT) and Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,LSE:RIO,NYSE:RIO), a massive stable of mid-tier miners and plenty of explorers — and that’s not counting any of the international miners with a slice of the action.

Mineral resources account for over 50 percent of total exports from Australia, with coal listed as the most valuable export in 2018.

It makes sense then, that the mining industry occupies the minds of government departments from local to national, with few who challenge the sector surviving (electorally) to tell the tale.

In 2019, the centre-right Coalition government under Prime Minister Scott Morrison is up against the resurgent centre-left Labor party, led by Bill Shorten.

A hot topic between the parties vying to lead Australia has been the Carmichael coal mine in Queensland — which has varying levels of government support and opposition — both local, state and federal. The Labor party is divided on supporting the project — which is toxic in the urban south of Australia, but supported locally.

The Carmichael mine is being pushed by the sprawling Indian company, the Adani Group.

While pollsters have a bad rap in recent years, the Coalition sat up and took note after its state-level counterpart in Victoria slipped further into opposition in late 2018 with a bruising electoral defeat. The upcoming New South Wales state election, due to be held in March, will be another signpost on the road to the federal election outcome.

South Africa — Presidential and General Election (May 8)

In South Africa, incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa of the African National Congress will be up for his first election as president, after completing the remainder of his predecessor Jacob Zuma’s second term.

Zuma resigned in early 2018, having been abandoned by his party amid accusations of corruption.

Frontrunner against Ramaphosa will be the Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane, who took the reign of South Africa’s centrist opposition party in 2015. A pastor, Maimane took over from Helen Zille — an arch-rival of Zuma who had been the face of opposition to the all-powerful African National Congress from 2007 to 2015. She remains Premier of the Western Cape province, which is a bastion of Democratic Alliance supporters.

The African National Congress is the party of Nelson Mandela, and has held power since the end of apartheid, and controls a thumping majority in the national parliament in Cape Town.

South Africa has a long and storied history of mining, and is the ancestral home of Anglo American (LSE:AAL), which maintains a significant presence there.

Coal, iron ore, gold, platinum, zinc and diamonds are the bread and butter of the highly diversified South African mining sector, which hosts major international companies like India’s Vedanta (NSE:VEDL), with its Gamsberg zinc ore complex in Northern Cape, and Canada’s Ivanhoe Mines (TSX:IVN), which is developing the Platreef PGE-gold-nickel-copper project in Limpopo province.

Philippines — General Election (May 13)

In the Philippines, the 2019 election will act as a mid-term election for President Rodrigo Duterte, who has lead the Asia-Pacific nation since 2016.

All seats in the lower house are up for election, where Duterte’s left-wing populist Partido Demokratiko Pilipino leads the all-powerful (by numbers) Coalition for Change bloc.

Duterte has been a controversial President for his term so far, making global headlines for encouraging a bloody war against drugs, which has seen 5,000 people killed by police since he took office.

He has also taken aim at the mining industry, proposing strict environmental regulations that would limit mining, and threatening to shut operations that don’t rehabilitate mining areas to his satisfaction (which is re-planted trees as tall as he was).

The Philippines, which as the second-largest nickel producer in the world, was under threat of a depressed mining industry in 2018 as a result of Duterte according to analysts.

Whatever his antics – polling shows that most Filipinos support Duterte and his approach to governance.

Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This bye-election win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the New Democratic Party shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the party’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the National Democratic Party persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the bye-election, the National Democratic Party would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the party in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, New Democratic Party fundraising – already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election – continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the New Democratic Party out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this bye-election win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the bye-election was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the party announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the New Democratic Party. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the New Democratic Party can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the New Democratic Party in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the New Democratic Party to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilised members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this bye-election win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

REUTERS/Chris Wattie

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday shuffled his cabinet for the second time in six weeks in response to a crisis caused by the resignation of a minister who then alleged inappropriate conduct by officials.

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb. 12 after less than a month in the job.

Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau’s resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October.

Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture.

MONTREAL – Air Canada has boosted its profit forecast for 2019 while foreseeing fatter margins and heavier free cash flow over the next three years.

On Thursday, the Montreal-based company predicted annual margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between 19 per cent and 22 per cent through 2021.

That guidance tops the street consensus of 17.5 per cent, according to analyst Doug Taylor of Canaccord Genuity Corp.

The airline also said it expects cumulative free cash flow of between $4 billion and $4.5 billion from 2019 until 2021, beating the previous guidance of between $2 billion and $3 billion.

Chief commercial officer Lucie Guillemette stressed the importance of business passengers to Air Canada’s plan, calling them a “vitally important profit segment.”

“We know the competitive landscape in our…industry is as fierce as ever,” she said at the company’s investor meeting in Toronto.

To attract passengers, Canada’s largest airline is stocking up on Airbus A220 jetliners, aiming for the addition of 30 in 2021.

The narrow-body aircraft, previously known as the Bombardier C Series, feature wider seats, larger windows and a quieter flight as well as better fuel efficiency.

The return on invested capital and generated free cash “will likely inspire imagination on exactly how that capital will be allocated given Air Canada’s balance sheet will be comfortably in the investment grade-type range by the end of this year,” said Taylor in a report.

“We believe the market should view these initial targets favourably; they reflect the culmination of several astute strategic moves made by the company in recent years and the ongoing shift from growth mode to more balanced capital deployment.”

Air Canada released its updated forecast alongside an announcement it has signed a partnership deal with American Express for a new loyalty program the airline is preparing to launch next year.

The 10-year agreement includes new co-branded payment cards, participation in the American Express membership rewards program, and expanded commercial co-operation between the two companies.

The deal will allow American Express membership rewards customers in Canada and the U.S. to transfer their points into the new Air Canada program once it has rolled out. American Express Aeroplan card members will also become members of Air Canada’s new loyalty program.

Air Canada reacquired the Aeroplan loyalty program from Aimia Inc. earlier this year after spinning off the points program in 2005 as part of the airline’s restructuring.

The airline has already signed agreements with TD Bank, CIBC and Visa that will see them stay on with the loyalty program until at least 2030.

All 32 MPs in Atlantic Canada are Liberals. That includes 11 in Nova Scotia, 10 in New Brunswick, seven in Newfoundland and Labrador and four in Prince Edward Island.

“I’m sure they would have some concern and some fear – fear – of Canadians beginning to breathe down their necks,” David Johnson of Cape Breton University said Thursday about the public’s reaction to Raybould’s claim of facing “inappropriate” pressure from within the Liberal government to intervene in a criminal case against the Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin. Johnson noted the latest polls still have the federal Liberals dominating in Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador. “Where there is some growing concern of Conservative strength is in Anglo New Brunswick,” he said. “That’s where the Conservatives are picking up some possibilities of picking off some Liberal seats.”

Speaking to reporters in Montreal on Wednesday, Trudeau disputed what Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons Justice Committee over almost four hours of stunning testimony. The former attorney general said several high-ranking officials — including Trudeau himself — pressed her to consider overruling Canada’s top prosecutor by offering SNC-Lavalin an agreement to avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and corruption charges. Wednesday was the first time she spoke in detail about the situation since controversy erupted over alleged political interference earlier this month. Johnson said we’ll know in the next couple of months whether the scandal does real damage to the party nationally, including here in Atlantic Canada. He said what the government does have going for it now is that a federal election is still eight months away. “If Justin Trudeau was facing a fixed election date of the spring, he would be sweating much more,” Johnson said. “I always say to my students when we talk about this, ‘What was the big political issue six months ago.’ When you try and think back six months and what was the big political issue …. Most people cannot come up with a quick answer.” Dr. Howard Ramos, a professor with Dalhousie University's Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology in Halifax, isn’t as convinced that the eight-month time frame won’t have an impact on party support.

He said what concerns him most is that voters simply won’t vote at all. “I don’t think Canadians are facing a slate of people running for prime minister that they are overly excited about. And when that happens, it tends to lead to voter turnout. That’s something to watch for in Atlantic Canada,” Ramos said. “Will young people vote? This certainly is not going to help on that front.

“If this discourages millennials from voting, which was a big component of Liberal support, if it discourages women from voting, that was a base for Liberals as well, if it discourages progressives who would’ve moved from the NDP .... that in turn will lead to a race where (it’s less known) what will happen.” Ramos referred to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as “compelling” and said it’s now a “high-stakes game of chicken” between her and Trudeau on who will flinch first in terms of her staying within caucus. “For Liberal MPs in the region, it certainly presents an obstacle moving forward in the series of months leading to the election,” he said. “The best tactic they can take is to distance themselves from the party and campaign on what they’ve done for the region and what they do as MPs themselves.” Philip Croucher is a reporter and Star bureau chief based in Halifax.

MONTREAL – Air Canada has signed a partnership deal with American Express for a new loyalty program that the airline is preparing to launch next year.

The 10-year agreement includes new co-branded payment cards, participation in the American Express membership rewards program, and expanded commercial co-operation between the two companies.

The deal will allow American Express membership rewards customers in Canada and the U.S. to transfer their points into the new Air Canada program once it has rolled out.

American Express Aeroplan cardmembers will also become members of Air Canada’s new loyalty program.

Air Canada reacquired the Aeroplan loyalty program from Aimia Inc. earlier this year after spinning off the points program in 2005 as part of the airline’s restructuring.

The airline has already signed agreements with TD Bank, CIBC and Visa that will see them stay on with the loyalty program until at least 2030.

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

“Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal “to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.”

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau’s leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.","Top ally supports embattled Canada PM, easing pressure for now",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1QH215-OCADN

Moreover, Canada and Mexico ...","OTTAWA — Canada and Mexico are dealing with lingering hard feelings over last summer's surprise Mexican trade deal with the United States as their new continental trade pact awaits a final stamp of political approval.

Two weeks ago, the head of a visiting delegation of Canadian parliamentarians told the newly installed Mexican foreign minister his country threw Canada ""under the bus"" last August when it forged a bilateral trade deal with the United States during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A top Mexican trade official tells The Canadian Press that while there may have been a misunderstanding, the U.S. side deal was the work of the previous Mexican government, and Canada and Mexico's new leaders are moving forward constructively.

The side deal between the U.S. and Mexico appeared to blindside the Trudeau government, forcing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to abort a three-country trip to Europe.

Watch: Trump says ""no one thought"" USMCA would be approved. Story continues below.

Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country's three leaders — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.

The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.

Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.

Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.

'I think it's getting better'

The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada's dissatisfaction about last August's Mexican side deal with the country's new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization's Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

""We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,"" Nault said in an interview.

Nault said he was concerned about ""the way it unfolded at the end,"" and a perception ""that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico."" He said that represented a break from ""what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn't overtake us.""

The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process. Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico's deputy trade minister

The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.

""I think it's getting better,"" Nault said this week of the relationship. ""Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.""

Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico's deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.

""That was part of the negotiation process ... right now, it's over,"" de la Mora said in an interview.

""The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.""

The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.

De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico's top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.

Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn't begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country's lawmakers.

'Those moments are over': Mexico's deputy trade minister

During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador's team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.

""We were not involved in that decision at all,"" de la Mora said.

""If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.""

She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.

It would be something that would send a really good signal to the markets.""","Mexico Threw Canada 'Under The Bus' During Trade Talks, Liberal MP Says",HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/28/mexico-canada-trade-talks_a_23680652/

Yesterday, Wilson-Raybould detailed what she described as a relentless campaign, including veiled threats, from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada’s top public servant and the finance minister’s office, for her to intervene and order a “remediation agreement” for the company to help it avoid criminal corruption charges.

SNC-Lavalin faces fraud and corruption charges regarding efforts to land business deals in Libya and has hoped to sign a “remediation agreement” to allow it to pay a fine and avoid a trial. A conviction on the charges could mean a ban on bidding for federal contracts for 10 years.

Speaking in suburban Montreal Thursday morning, Trudeau said he totally disagrees with how Wilson-Raybould described discussions she had with him and others about the case.

The prime minister said the federal ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, will settle disagreements over what happened.

“Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge, who is an officer of Parliament, who will make a determination in this issue,” Trudeau said after an announcement at the Canadian Space Agency.

“So, while political parties and various people are making, or trying to draw a lot of attention to this issue, there is a process, both at the justice committee and indeed at the ethics commissioner, that will make a determination on what actually happened here.”

Over more than three hours of testimony Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee of 10 meetings and 10 phone calls involving 11 people between September and December 2018, all aimed at getting her to “politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada.”

Wilson-Raybould detailed a September meeting she said she had with Trudeau where he brought up the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving Quebec and the spectre of job losses during a provincial election campaign.

Asked Thursday, Trudeau wouldn’t say if the company had told him it planned to move its headquarters if it couldn’t avoid criminal prosecution in Canada.

He said there were “many and broad conversations about the importance of defending jobs” across the country and there was “no doubt” those discussions didn’t cross any legal lines.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that’s exactly what we’ve done every step of the way,” Trudeau said. “We’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws, and respected the independence of the judiciary — of that there actually is no doubt. There are disagreements in perspective on this, but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.”

Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to the veterans-affairs portfolio in January, a move she believed was a result of her not doing as Trudeau and his staff wanted, even though they denied that was the case.

As for Wilson-Raybould’s future as a Liberal, Trudeau said he is still mulling over whether she will be allowed to remain in caucus.

“I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,” he said.","On SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau says it's up to Canada's ethics watchdog to decide who is telling the truth",O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/canada/trudeau-says-ethics-watchdog-to-decide-truth-in-snc-lavalin-affair/wcm/222ea957-48c9-42fb-8a69-da07586129d4

TORONTO (AP) — Cabinet ministers rallied around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday, a day after his former attorney general testified that he inappropriately tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company in order to save jobs — a case that has shaken the government in an election year.

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that ""the prime minister would never apply improper pressure"" and expressed ""100 percent faith"" in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was ""entirely appropriate"" for his staff to talk with the justice minister's staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""That's exactly what we have done every step of the way.

""We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,"" he added. ""There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had ""approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn't think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould's testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau's office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament's justice committee to testify.

""I believe my evidence will be of assistance,"" Butts said in a statement.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the public support on Thursday of a top political ally, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over a deepening political scandal.

The national statistics office says that in 2017, the most recent year available, 3.4 million Canadians, or 9.5 per cent of the population, lived below the poverty line the government officially adopted late last year -- including 622,000 children -- which is the lowest the agency reported going back to 2006.

The drops since the Liberals took office in 2015 were also noted in the agency's release: 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 -- the first full year of the benefit -- compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada said an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017 -- which Liberals touted Tuesday as a political and policy victory.

""It certainly shows a program that is simple for the government to manage, simple for families to receive, and fair for everyone ... is a good thing when it comes to making more Canadians able to make ends meet,"" Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in an interview.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives' universal child care benefit. The agency calculates that between 2016 and 2017, a couple with children saw their median benefit rise by $1,200, while lone parents received an extra $1,300.

Duclos suggested numbers will drop further, particularly once the Canada Workers Benefit launches next month and expands a wage subsidy introduced under former prime minister Stephen Harper to boost the incomes of the country's working poor.

Duclos was less clear about whether the Liberals would boost the base value of the child benefit or ensure immigration status doesn't affect eligibility as some anti-poverty activists have requested.

The Liberals promised in the 2015 election that the child benefit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty compared to 2013 figures, but based on a different measure of poverty than was previously used.

Parsing out the numbers, the Liberals met their projections: a drop of 315,000 in children in poverty in 2017 compared to 2013.

Last year, the Liberals pegged the value of the benefit to inflation -- two years before they planned to do so -- and promised by 2020 to cut poverty rates by 20 per cent of 2015 figures.

What Statistics Canada reported Tuesday is that there were 826,000 fewer people living in poverty in 2017 compared to 2015 -- or just shy of the 20 per cent target.

An expert panel the Liberals turned to for help crafting the poverty plan originally recommended a 25 per cent target for 2020. The Liberals chose 20 per cent, leading some experts to suggest the goal was likely a given based on the measures the government had introduced.

The next part of the plan proposes a drop to 50 per cent of 2015 levels by 2030, which will require thought about how to ""make more of a dent in those who are living in and with extreme poverty,"" Lindsay Tedds, scientific director of fiscal and economic policy at the University of Calgary's school of public policy, said on Twitter.

A bill to set the poverty plan into law has yet to pass the House of Commons, but it doesn't propose any additional spending than what is already promised.

""We picked the indicator, we picked where we want the indicator to be, but there's no plan if we miss that target and there should be,"" said David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""That's the point of a poverty reduction plan as opposed to having just a tracking plan, which is presently what it is.""","Economy, bump in child benefits fuel poverty rate drop: Statistics Canada",Kitchener CTV News,https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/economy-bump-in-child-benefits-fuel-poverty-rate-drop-statistics-canada-1.4313983

28,World,2019-02-27T18:25:00.0000000Z,This is all by way of explaining why I am stunned and angered by the latest example of Canada’s blind obedience ... claiming that a phoney election produced a would-be dictator.,"In the morning, I saw the Spanish nurses distributing milk to the youngest victims of the U.S. proxy war on Nicaragua. Later, I saw a half-naked child with the effects of dysentery flowing from his tiny body as he ran through the refugee camp outside San Juan Del Rio Coco, on the border with Honduras.

It was 1985, and I was there with a group called Witness for Peace. I was an American then and the idea was that if a bunch of U.S. civilians were put in the most active part of the war zone, violence might not come to people there, for a time. The U.S. proxy force, the Contra, might recognize the bad “optics” of killing their sponsor’s countrymen. In San Juan Del Rio Coco, it worked. The village had changed hands several times, and we could hear gunfire, but there were no Contra attacks during our stay.

I went to Nicaragua out of anger at my country’s blatant imperialism. I went to “do something for those people.” Instead, the families who took me into their homes did something immensely meaningful for me.

This is all by way of explaining why I am stunned and angered by the latest example of Canada’s blind obedience to the U.S. with regard to Venezuela. Our leaders are apparently unable to appreciate how rich it is to hear would-be dictator Donald Trump, of all people, claiming that a phoney election produced a would-be dictator.

My experience in Nicaragua familiarized me with some of the major villains who have resurfaced in the Venezuela story.

My experience in Nicaragua familiarized me with some of the major villains who have resurfaced in the Venezuela story. One is Elliott Abrams, Trump’s new special envoy for Venezuela. Abrams was a major architect and defender of the Contra war, and he publicly defended right-wing death squads in El Salvador, including one that murdered Archbishop Oscar Romero as he was saying mass in 1980.

An El Salvador government unit, the Atlacatl Battalion, committed mass rape, then murdered more than 100 children in a place called El Mozote. On a wall, soldiers wrote in blood: “One dead child is one less guerrilla.” Abrams characterized first-hand reports of this massacre by U.S. journalists as propaganda: “El Mozote appears to be an incident that is at least being significantly misused … by the guerrillas,” An “incident.” Elliott Abrams: Canada’s new Venezuela working partner.

Another figure from long ago that one might have hoped never to see again is Trump’s “national security” adviser, John Bolton. He cancelled a trip to Korea to focus on Venezuela. Bolton was recently seen holding a notepad with “5,000 troops to Colombia” on it. Bolton has threatened to invade Venezuela and imprison its president in the infamous Guantanamo gulag. John Bolton: Canada’s new Venezuela working partner.

Is anyone really having trouble understanding the reason for all this? Bolton observed: “It will make a big difference economically if we could have American oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities of Venezuela.”

There is one newer player in this sorry saga: Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. She has been a leader in this unholy alliance that continues decades of Canada’s subservience to U.S. domination in Central and South America. Her recent justification that Venezuela is “in our neighbourhood” is just a Canadian variation of the standard U.S. characterization of sovereign countries as in its “backyard.”

The next time you hear Freeland or any government official prattle on about “the rule of law,” consider Art. 2, Sec. 4 of the Charter of the United Nations: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Singh and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer are both calling for a public inquiry into the matter.",Left-leaning Canada opposition leader wins parliamentary seat,www.kitco.com,https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-02-27/Left-leaning-Canada-opposition-leader-wins-parliamentary-seat.html

32,LifeStyle,2019-02-25T19:28:00.0000000Z,"Bourgeois: So I think a lot of people are worried about the election season and rightfully so, with things happening south of the border or eastern Canada. I think there are a few major things we can focus on this year to drive home as election priorities.","The president is the chief representative of the Students’ Union and the 30,000 undergraduate students attending the University of Alberta. They oversee the rest of the Students’ Union executives, the organization’s operations, and sit on a number of university governance bodies including the Board of Governors and General Faculties Council.

This year, two candidates are hoping to get the top job, both of them current Students’ Union vice-presidents. Akanksha Bhatnagar is a fourth-year political science and sociology double major and the current vice-president (academic), and Andre Bourgeois is a sixth-year sociology student and the current vice-president (student-life).

The following interviews have been condensed and simplified for clarity.

In one minute, can you tell us why you are running for Students’ Union president?

Akanksha Bhatnagar: I’m running for president because I believe students need authentic representation at every level of student governance, and that’s just not the case right now. It’s important we have a president that represents all students on our campus.

We also have a unique opportunity right now to frame our conversations to the government a lot differently in a year where our provincial and federal governments could be changing. Overall, my experience in student governance has taught me how to navigate our university’s political waters and hold our governments and administrators more accountable, which will allow me to be a president that’s not afraid to speak my mind.

Andre Bourgeois: I decided to run for president because I have been involved with the Students’ Union for quite a while now, ever since my first year, and I’ve been involved in increasing levels of responsibility and leadership. Each time I have been presented with an opportunity or the capacity to improve these student experience, I really try to find ways to mobilize the students around me and include students in creating meaningful real change.

I think this year as vice-president (student life), we were really successful at getting the university to move on things they don’t usually do, like HUB Mall safety and security, and I want to translate that success into the presidency to continue creating that kind of change for students.

Can you concisely explain your platform?

Bhatnagar: This year my platform is centred around continued advocacy for an affordable education, creating a way for every student to explore leadership, and ensuring that our time on campus sets us up for success after we graduate.

As vice-president (academic), I pushed our university to look at more ways to adopt open educational resources by chairing the Open Education Resource Advocacy Group. I want our government to create a sustainable funding model for open educational resources.

Affordable education is typically a long-term project, but in the short term what I want to do is create more Students’ Union needs-based awards. Right now we give away $100,000 in awards to students who are the most involved, and the problem with that is students who need these scholarships the most don’t really have access to them.

The other aspect is student leadership. A lot of students come to campus to get a great degree and head off. I notice a lot of people don’t get involved until later in their degree and I think it’s important we connect students to the Students’ Union earlier on in their degree so they have more time to develop as student leaders.

And lastly, work-integrated learning is something I care very passionately about because I know how scary it can be to try and find a job once you graduate.

Bourgeois: The things that excite me most about the platform are completing the Student Charter of Rights, continuing to advocate for mental health services on campus, as well as sexual violence risk response and prevention. More broadly, improving the transparency and efficiency and accountability of the Students’ Union.

But it’s important that none of these projects or ideas get accomplished by one person. I am not so naive to think any of the three ideas or four points I bring to the table will massively disrupt the framework of the university, and that’s why I made my platform with the values and principles of teamwork and collaboration. Bringing more students to the table to actually affect that kind of real enduring change that will continue on after I’m gone for generations to come.

Both candidates for president this year are current Students’ Union vice-presidents, what distinguishes you from the other candidate?

Bhatnagar: I think the number one thing that distinguishes me from other candidate is that I’m a really authentic leader. I’ve spent a lot of time on campus getting to know what our campus looks like, but I’ve also faced a lot of adversity on campus. I can really speak for students, and I think it’s important a president reflects what our campus looks like, and that’s not really been the case with executives in the past.

I think a president needs to be someone who understands how to navigate tough political waters. We need a president who understands how to navigate these spaces, and isn’t going to be taking the time to understand how to be a strong political leader.

My experience, by chairing the Council of Faculty Association boards and leading a team of 14 faculty association presidents to accomplish their goals this year has been not only influential, but also something i know I’ll be able to do as president.

Bourgeois: Because Akanksha and I have worked on the same executive team this year, we worked on a lot of the same projects together, a lot of the goals and initiatives and advocacy asks we have will be roughly on the same track.

So I think the number one thing that distinguishes me from Akanksha is the breadth and depth of the experience I have with the Students’ Union. I’ve been involved at every year of my university working with students from each and every faculty, every year of their program and I’ve been presented with more responsibility and increased leadership experiences and I think that leadership experience and that system-wide experience with the Students’ Union is really what sets me apart.

Recently, several other student unions in other universities are at the epicentre of controversy involving corruption and financial mismanagement. How will you prevent that from happening here?

Bhatnagar: I think it’s really unfortunate other Students’ Unions across the country are doing that because they’re tainting the name of Students’ Unions nationally. So I think what [the U of A’s] Students’ Union does that negates that from happening is just having a team that is very transparent. All of our minutes, all of our finances, all of our materials are posted online.

But I think students have unparalleled access to the Students’ Union if they ever need any support. If they ever need someone to listen to, not only was I that person as vice-president academic, but I want to continue to be that person as president.

I would argue we’re one of the top Students’ Unions in this country and I think that’s because we have such strong long-term staff who’ve stayed with the Students’ Union executives. We just have an organization that won’t stand for these things to happen and I never can see the University of Alberta Students’ Union ever being involved in a scandal as such.

Bourgeois: The problems that are happening at other Students’ Union are multifaceted and you can’t paint any one issue with a broad brush.

But I think, specifically, what we can do to prevent corruption and increase accountability at the Students’ Union is to publish an annual report outlining what things the Students’ Union has done with the student fees, how many students have benefited from those things, and not being afraid to acknowledge when the Students’ Union has made a mistake. I think when we identify our mistakes in some sort of annual easy to read and digestible format, students will both appreciate and understand the value the Students’ Union brings to them.

What should the Students’ Union’s priorities be during an election year?

Bhatnagar: During an election year, we have a really unique opportunity to frame conversations around what really matters to students. I think a lot of these projects are going to be lead by both the Council of Alberta University Students and the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations.

But the top things I would say are probably how we interact with deferred maintenance on our campus. Right now there isn’t really a funding model for that. The student spaces levy was an example of one solution, but I think we’re going to have to look at other solutions going forward.

I think it’s important we push our university to actually truly tell us what predictability around international student tuition looks like. I think Bill 19 was a huge success, but there’s a lot of little tidbits we still have to iron out.

I think the last sort of ask I would love to see is mental health resources funding. We all understand mental health is an issue on this campus. But we need to take more of a cultural lens at the way our mental health funding looks like because right now I do not have a way to talk to anyone on campus about my experiences and I know a lot of other students are in the same boat.

Bourgeois: So I think a lot of people are worried about the election season and rightfully so, with things happening south of the border or eastern Canada. I think there are a few major things we can focus on this year to drive home as election priorities.

First, I think affordability of education is key, whether that be pursuing upfront grants or regulating international students tuition. I think pursuing greater work-integrated learning opportunities is also really important.

And the third one is just blatantly mental health. Mental health was cut this year, like on-campus supports for clinical mental health care were cut, and that has to be an issue moving forward in the election. We should absolutely push against that and ensure we don’t lose our on-campus supports, whatever the outcome of the election may be.

If elected president, how would you connect with your 7,700 international student constituents and how would you advocate on their behalf?

Bhatnagar: If elected, something I did this year was work really hard to figure out ways we can still represent international student issues regardless of there not being an International Students’ Association. I did that by really working closely with University of Alberta International.

I think, going forward, it’s not my job to be speaking on behalf of international students if I don’t know what they actually need, so I think it’s important we’re connecting with the leaders on campus.

I think we have to recreate the International Students’ Association because that was a failed project of our executive this year, and I think there needs to be a lot more conversations around what it is they wanted.

Bourgeois: I think something we did this year that worked really well to connect to international students is working with University of Alberta International because they have a council and a committed of very highly engaged and active international students. Working with them to hear what is affecting them, how we can better meet their needs, I was surprised about a lot of the things we heard.

Another way is the Students’ Union can be more active in creating questions in our surveys and in all of the outreach we do to students, specifically targeting some of it to identify and find out what issues specifically affect international students and how we can work to address them.

Joke question: Thanos threatens to snap away the Students’ Union. What would you do to stop him?

Bhatnagar: My super power is just getting people to care about something, and I think if I can do that, and the vice-presidents can figure out some other thing, we’re just going to have to stop this from happening. But I think if he were to destroy this Students’ Union, I would just make another one, because I think representation is too important to just get rid of it.

Bourgeois: I think we would get the executives to dress up as The Incredibles again. Mobilize together, get our squad, find the guy that was dressed up as The Flash on Halloween, and just have some big campus Avengers thing.

Most of us are counting down to spring, but others are further ahead to the finish line at the next federal election come October, especially given that the region has two vacant seats with no incumbent (current holders of office) running.

One side of the Valley partisan fervour was cooking with gas when Conservative leader Andrew Scheer hosted a town hall meeting in Windsor. As Scott Brison has already exited as MP, it’s not surprising his visit with Kings-Hants candidate Martha MacQuarrie was his only Nova Scotia stop outside of Halifax.

Scheer told the Valley Harvester after the town hall he has no interest in municipal reform Doug Ford style nationwide, even though municipalities across the country are trying to figure it out and asking the federal government to help them figure it out.

“As a party, we fundamentally respect provincial areas of jurisdiction and leave it to the provinces to work those things out with local officials,” he said. “The key is to make sure they have stable sources of revenue,” said Scheer. “It was the last Conservative government that made the gas tax permanent, so (municipalities) could plan accordingly so they didn’t have to guess what they could accomplish and be empowered to make those decisions.”

Every election is an opportunity for people to have their say and some influence over what’s important to them. For municipal leaders, too. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) is their official national voice on priorities and this year, municipal modernization is also on the table.

“We believe it is time to modernize the federal-municipal relationship, to ensure the local concerns of families are being heard in Ottawa,” said FCM Big City Mayors’ Caucus chair Don Iveson in a recent press release. (Iveson is also the mayor of Edmonton.) “Too often, local governments are excluded from the federal negotiating table when national projects begin.”

Not just Canada’s big cities, but even the smallest of rural municipalities have to deal with national policy, like climate change or cannabis legalization. They’ve witnessed such a huge increase in responsibilities in recent years, but no more powers and much less money.

“We’re all having the same conversations at our tables across the province,” said Pam Mood, mayor of Yarmouth. Mood is also the new vice-president of the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities, but wasn’t speaking for them when she made that comment.

Mood recently spent some time in the Valley meeting with some community and municipal leaders through the region as she seeks the nomination (expected to be in April) to be the Liberal candidate replacing incumbent MP Colin Fraser on the ballot in West Nova. The riding has five towns and four rural districts between Yarmouth and on the eastern side of its boundaries, which end in Berwick.

Also seeking the Liberal nod for the riding is Yarmouth resident Michael Drew and Jason Deveau of Clare, neither of whom are career politicians, although Deveau works for Fraser.

Even though Mood is mayor, at the municipal level there is no party line to tow and she admits that’s a learning curve for her, but she also sees it as an advantage.

“I’m not seeking to move up; I’m hoping to move over,” she told the Valley Harvester. A lot of her philosophy comes from her grandfather, Fred Emin, who was also a mayor of Yarmouth. “He told me to always pay attention to the local level because that’s where the people are.”

Among the biggest topics citizens bring to her generally are cell phone signal and internet access.

“It impacts everything, but especially real estate sales, bringing new people and new businesses in,” she said. Housing and food insecurity are also high and how growing cannabis affects agricultural land. Around those “tables” Mood spoke about, the money municipalities collect for the province for education, which often takes the largest slice of pie from municipal tax dollars. “Generally, the needs of municipalities can no longer be met within its boundaries,” said Mood. “That’s why partnerships are really important. We can’t do it alone and we need to include other levels of government.”

“It’s wonderful to me that the story that I lived through can be part of this generation’s knowledge,” the writer and poet says from her home in Toronto.

Kogawa, 83, chronicled her family’s internment experience in the British Columbia Interior town of Slocan and their forced labour at a sugar beet farm in Coaldale, Alta., in her acclaimed 1981 novel “Obasan.”

She was six years old in 1942 when her older brother Timothy and their parents were stripped of their property and belongings after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor changed the lives of 22,000 Japanese-Canadians, most of whom were born in Canada but classified as a threat to national security. Their American counterparts were also interned but their homes and businesses were not confiscated and sold.

Now, Kogawa has written the script for an interactive augmented reality experience called “East of the Rockies,” which brings to life a dark chapter in Canada’s history through the story of a 17-year-old girl named Yuki who is sent to the same camp where Kogawa’s family was taken.

The project, available March 1 through Apple’s App Store, was developed by digital production agency Jam3 and co-produced by the National Film Board. It allows users to tap, swipe and zoom in on objects in the camp, such as Yuki’s beloved family record player, and hear music they listened to in their cramped space shared with a new mother desperately trying to care for her twin babies, along with her grandfather.

Archival photos of other Japanese families, complete with details about the conditions they endured, often while separated, can also be accessed through the app.

Dirk Van Ginkel, a creative director with Jam3, who considered the nearly two-year project a labour of love as he worked with his then-colleague Jason Legge, says the pair played games on PlayStation with Kogawa to get her used to the idea of interactive technology.

“Instead of consuming content just linearly, you are in charge of what you’re looking at and how you’re looking at it,” Van Ginkel says.

Facial features of the characters are obscured because those detained in the camp were “not seen as humans,” Van Ginkel adds.

The technique also seems to tap into the harsh tempo of current populist views in some countries that Kogawa says could propel a return to racist policies mirroring those of the 1940s and impact the lives of people around the world.

Kogawa says the fear and resentment she witnessed as a child who looked different from the majority fuelled a lot of suffering including her mother’s breakdown. But she is proud of Canada’s current stance on immigration, calling the country a “beacon of hope.”

Back then, however, Japanese-Canadians were given the choice of being deported to Japan or moving east of the Rockies after the war ended, says Kogawa, who was born in Vancouver and is a Nisei – someone born in North America to parents who immigrated from Japan.

“A lot of people did come to Toronto but they were scattered across the country,” she says, adding that dispersal made it tough to retain their culture, with more than 90 per cent of Japanese-Canadians intermarrying and “essentially disappearing” or remaining single.

“The other day I went to a nursing home and there were two old Niseis, neither of whom had been married. And they had nobody to visit them, no family. That’s the tragedy of the first generation.”

Kogawa’s 21-year-old granddaughter, Anne Canute, narrates “East of the Rockies,” in which her displaced character reminisces on a teenage crush while trying to reckon with the reality of losing the family’s home in Vancouver: “I wonder who’s sleeping in my bedroom? Who has all our things?”

Canute says she grew up listening to her grandmother’s stories about her uprooted childhood and the racial tensions that swirled across Canada toward Japanese-Canadians but didn’t learn much about that history until after high school, thinking: “‘Wow, this is just a weird thing that happened to my family.'”

“I think the dispersal of community and lack of ability to practise culture was really impactful for both my grandmother and my mother and me,” says Canute, a fourth-year University of B.C. student whose studies include Asian migration and the development of those communities in Canada.

The National Film Board’s website includes a free downloadable English and French PDF learning kit based on “East of the Rockies” for high schools, featuring lessons on life in the various internment camps, repatriation and the impact of Canada’s policies on future generations.

Jagmeet Singh has secured himself a seat in the House of Commons, and now his sights are set on becoming prime minister.

“We made history today,” Singh told his supporters Monday after winning the federal byelection in Burnaby South. “When I was growing up as a kid, I could’ve never imagined someone like me ever running to be prime minister. Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there: ‘Yes, you can.'”

“It wasn’t very surprising,” political analyst Philippe Fournier said of the result, calling the B.C. seat a “favourable” for New Democrats, It also helps that the Greens didn’t run a candidate in the British Columbia riding, Fournier added.

The win is important for Singh because it provides a platform to share his vision in Parliament. It also gives him an opportunity to debate his biggest political opponents during question period.

But the byelection results weren’t entirely positive for New Democrats. The party did lose their seat in Montreal’s Outremont, the riding former leader Tom Mulcair held since 2007.

“He lost it, but he lost it badly, too,” Fournier said of the Quebec riding. The NDP is now polling at 12 to 14 per cent nationally, a distant third behind the Liberals and Conservatives, according to Fournier.

“It’s really, really bad,” the creator of political blogs 338Canada and Qc125 said of the NDP’s poll numbers. “[Singh] has not really been that convincing.”

Highlighting Canada’s housing ‘crisis’

The new MP will have to find a way to connect with Canadians if he wishes to fulfil his dream of becoming prime minister.

Former NDP national director Karl Belanger acknowledges the key to success for Singh will be showing that he can grow the party.

“He needs to find a way to connect with [voters] and to tell a story that they can relate to,” Belanger said. “So far, he has been unable to establish that kind of narrative.”

Hoping to improve on the 44 seats the NDP won in 2015, Singh may have identified an issue that affects nearly all Canadians.

“Across Canada, people are worried about housing,” Singh told CBC News Network on Tuesday. “People are finding it hard to find a home.”

Vancouver Sun columnist Daphne Bramham says this is a problem that is especially pressing for young people.

“The issue of housing is as important in Regina as it is in Vancouver,” Bramham told Yahoo Canada.

Singh says it’s a “crisis” that is top of mind for many Canadians, among the top three for many he has spoken to. He insists it’s the government’s job to find solutions for problems, and this one could be addressed with more affordable housing.

Thank you #BurnabySouth! I'm determined & ready to fight for the help people need – from the housing crisis to health care not covering everyone the way it should, Canadians deserve better. This isn’t the end of a campaign – it's the beginning of one. See you in Parliament. pic.twitter.com/x8Q1SyHcEU — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) February 26, 2019





Why Quebec may be a challenge

The housing debate is one that could potentially win over millennials, but it may not be enough to regain the support the NDP has lost since the “orange wave” swept across Canada in 2011. Led by Jack Layton, the party became the official Opposition for the first time ever, propelled by strong gains in Quebec.

Fournier sees the Liberals emerging as the big winners if the NDP can’t improve on the 16 seats won in Quebec during the the last election.

“We’ve got lots of great support to build on, we’ve got great MPs that are there,” Singh said, as reported by The Canadian Press.

There’s a potential roadblock in Quebec this time around because of the fact that Singh, a Sikh, wears a turban. Fournier, a Quebec native, says it’s more about religion for Quebecers than it is about race when it comes to voting. After all, this is a province that last year gave a majority mandate to a government that has proposed a ban on public servants wearing religious symbols at work.

“It does turn off many Quebecers,” Fournier admitted.





That may not be as big of an issue for the rest of Canada. In 2017, an Angus Reid Institute poll suggested 56 per cent of Canadians could vote for someone who wears a religious head covering.

A stream of bad news, both domestic and wider-reaching have seen the Indian Rupee’s (INR) investor appeal pare sharply in recent weeks leading institutional forecasters to predict further declines for the Rupee against the US Dollar.

At the time of writing, the US-Dollar-to-Rupee (USD/INR) exchange rate was seen to be trading at 70.838 following a week of choppy price action yielding an overall weekly decline of 0.15% for the cross.

The Rupee is facing pressure on a number of fronts, with the Reserve Bank of India’s surprise cut to rates and dovish shift under newly appointed governor Shaktikanta Das, upcoming parliamentary elections and flaring cross-border tension between India and Pakistan all representing risks to Rupee appreciation.

On the geo-political front, head of Indian market research, Ashish Vaidya of DBS bank noted rising geo-political tension could weigh on investor sentiment regarding not only the Indian Rupee but the region as a whole.

Vaidya wrote “If there is any negative news on the escalation of cross border conflict, then the macros which are providing support to the market today may not last long,” adding “Uncertainty may also be extended due to general elections.""

In the wake of the week’s cross-border military action which saw both Indian and Pakistani air forces conduct reciprocal air strikes the three-month Impied Volatility index spiked to a three and a half month high of 8.96%.

Kotak Securities currency analyst, Anindya Banerjee, commented that exacerbation of the cross-border conflict could keep potential investors side-lined, “In the past two weeks, the rupee's future indicators are showing signs of swings… his is to be seen if further strikes take place crossing the border. Increased political tension at a time when we debate over the next elected government will make investors wary of taking new bets.""

Surprise RBI Rates Cut and Dovish Shift Open the Door For Further Policy Easing

It’s not only risks on the geopolitical front which could impinge on any 2019 Rupee-rebound according to a number of institutional perspectives given the Reserve Bank of India’s recent shift to a dovish stance, surprise cut to rates and open-door policy on further easing threatening to undermine efforts to stabilise inflation.

According to the latest poll of economist conducted by Bloomberg, median projections for the US Dollar to Indian Rupee (USDINR) exchange rate see the cross at 71.25 near-term - or in other words virtually unchanged from levels seen this week.

Among the respondents, Royal Bank of Canada’s head of Asian FX strategy, Sue Trinh was decidedly more pessimistic on the Rupee than the average projections, with a near-term Dollar-to-Rupee forecast of 80 INR to the USD.

Alongside the considerable challenge of funding India’s widening budget deficit, Trinh cited the potential for further rate cuts to weigh on the Rupee. Trinh wrote “The combination of consumer inflation undershoots and dovish policy bias of Governor Das suggests big rate cuts could be around the corner.”

At the time of writing, the Indian Rupee remained the second weakest performer in 2019 thus far among Asian currencies amid uncertainty ahead of the upcoming elections. The RBI’s dovish lean, coupled with the military skirmish with Pakistan are expected to exacerbate uncertainty further.

Commenting on the risks impacting the Rupee, Trinh said “It is not specific to India, but everywhere you look there are potential flashpoints that can flare up at the drop of a dime in the context of slowing global growth, massive levels of debt and increasingly desperate governments,” adding that at the moment, the risk is currently “under-priced” by markets suggesting a downside bias for the INR near-term.","Indian Rupee Forecast: Cross-Border Conflict, Elections And Dovish RBI Tipped To Send INR Exchange Rates Lower",Exchange Rates,https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/24880/2019-03-01-indian-rupee-forecast-crossborder-conflict-elections-and-dovish-rbi-tipped-to-send-inr-exchange-rates-lower.html

This week the pipeline protesters rolled into Ottawa in their oilfield trucks and staged a protest on Parliament Hill. The protest was noisy and orderly, but it was overshadowed by the so-called yellow vesters. Members of this fringe group are anti-immigrant, racist and a right-wing menace and have little actual interest in pipelines.

The protest was loud and tied up traffic on Wellington Street in front of the Parliament buildings. However, large trucks take up space but only carry a few people. When the protesters gathered for their rally, they formed a group estimated by the media to be about 150 people.

The protest was supported by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, People’s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier and Faith Goldy.

Goldy is a white nationalist who has been a loud-mouthed right-wing gadfly; she believes the white race is superior and must be protected. When she tried to speak at the rally, a group of Indigenous rights protectors booed and shouted her down. She in turn told the group, “If you don’t like our country, leave it.” A hilarious comment to a group of Indigenous people.

Conservative Senator David Tkachuk distinguished himself by calling upon the protesters “to roll over every Liberal left in the country,” not exactly an inspiring comment from the chamber of sober second thought.

Preston Manning used to explain the flakes in the Reform party with the comment that a bright light is bound to attract a few bugs. Now the bugs are getting organized and flexing their muscles. The yellow vesters and their right-wing supporters hijacked the movement and focused on immigration, open borders, the UN Declaration on immigration and of course the carbon tax. They also called for Trudeau to be charged with treason.

The original group wants to see pipelines built, which is fair, but they are ignoring the consultation process and the court decisions that have caused the delay. Blaming a politician is pointless. This is the legal system at work and while these protesters want people to obey the law, they are prepared to ignore it.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer addressed the group and gave them his support. He never once mentioned the racist yellow vest members who were present. Instead he called for the building of pipelines, ignoring the legal process that must be completed.

Scientists and environmentalists agree that carbon pricing is the fairest way to address greenhouse gas emissions, but the right wing has seized on it as a vote-getter while the United Nations has warned that if nothing is done by 2040 the earth will experience extreme weather, coastal flooding and the loss of coral reefs.

Right now the movement is gaining momentum and is aimed at the federal Liberals because of the coming election; however, it might soon be aimed at First Nations that are opposing pipelines. This fear wasn’t lost on the group of rights protectors who showed up on Parliament Hill to let the protesters know that we have rights and concerns too.

I fear that this yellow vest movement could take a nasty, racist turn because of the right-wing groups that are attracted to it. In Canada the alt right is becoming emboldened by growing support from racist groups in the United States. Right-wing populism is moving north.

This is of concern to me because any form of racial intolerance affects all people of colour. White supremacy masks itself as anti-immigration, anti-First Nations and anti-people of colour. It’s a dangerous, divisive movement and it thrives on people experiencing hardship and alienation.

Some people prefer to blame others and government institutions for their problems, but in the case of fossil fuels it is a worldwide problem.

Our oil is sold almost exclusively to the United States, and the years of being America’s gas tank are coming to an end. They are moving toward self-sufficiency and renewable energy.

Jihadi brides and caliphate cubs. With the men dead, imprisoned or on the lam, their wives and children are coming home to roost.

But there’s nothing left of the Caliphate except for an ideology. As, according to the United Nations, upwards of 9,000 people have, over the past four days, evacuated the remaining thumbnail of land held by the terror group in Syria — the village of Baghuz. Ninety-nine per cent of those in headlong flight are women and children, herded to nearby al-Hawl, a Kurdish-controlled camp for displaced persons in northeastern Syria.

Breeding. Because that, it turned out, was their primary value to ISIS, to populate the nascent state as housewives and mothers, broodmares for the next generation of Islamist zealots.

Idiotic girls — teenagers mostly — who packed themselves off to Syria and northern Iraq, slipping away from families, willingly giving up passports, sometimes taking up arms, often gleefully pumping out propaganda against the nations of their birth, urging others to join them.

The children are dying by the week. Many others didn’t survive the exodus.

They are subsisting, these woebegone dregs of the Caliphate, in tents, without heat, with little food and scarce medical supplies.

At least three of those women — identified by name in media reports — are Canadian, as would be their offspring, regardless of the fathers’ nationality.

The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Syria says the camp’s population is now more than 47,000, with women and children under the age of 5 making up 75 per cent of the displaced.

Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, a dual Canadian-American citizen raised in Hamilton as a Mennonite, married an ISIS fighter she met online. She was recently interviewed by Rukmini Callimachi of the New York Times .

Yet Ottawa has no plan to repatriate these innocent victims, hasn’t even offered consular services to their mothers. Officials here don’t know what to do with the wives and little ones, anymore than they’ve articulated a strategy for retrieving Canadian citizen fighters — a conundrum the Liberals clearly hope to keep off the radar until after the next federal election.

“I don’t have words for how much regret I have,” Polman told Callimachi, claiming that she was thrown in jail and raped when she tried to flee ISIS.

Yet the brutal crimes of ISIS — beheading journalists, mass rape of Yazidi minority women — were well-documented by the time Polman crossed the border into Islamic State territory in 2015. She was already the mother of three grown children, not a naive ISIS fangirl.

“I’m not interested in bloodshed, and I didn’t know what to believe,” said Polman. “These are videos on YouTube. What’s real? What’s not real.”

Dura Ahmed, a 28-year-old from Toronto captured by American forces, was interviewed by CNN earlier this month and professed no regret about venturing into the death cult’s heartland in 2012, married off to a fighter with whom she’s had children. “I believe in sharia, wherever sharia is. We must follow whoever is implementing the way, the law.”

And Amy, a 34-year-old from Alberta, who converted to Islam and embraced the cause with her Canadian husband — widowed, then remarried to a Bosnian ISIS fighter. Pregnant, she spoke to CTV last week. “I think I should be allowed to go home. I don’t believe I did anything wrong. I didn’t kill anybody. I didn’t do any harm to anybody.”

Nobody wants them, certainly not the Kurds who’ve done all the heavy fighting against the Islamic State over the past eight years. With ISIS in its death throes and the U.S. preparing to withdraw its troops, Kurdish forces are girding for a planned offensive by Turkey. They don’t have the resources to mind the women and children camp detainees.

Abdul Karim Omar, de facto foreign minister in the Kurdish-held north, said he and the Syrian Democratic Forces have more than done their part. Over to you, Western nations. Noting that at least six British jihadis are being held in prison — including two members of the notorious “Beatles” gang accused of beheading Western hostages — Omar warned that the imprisoned men would be likely to escape or be set free in the anticipated combat to come.

“This region is not stable politically and militarily. If there is war and attacks, those fighters and their wives will come back to Britain and be terrorists,” he warned. “Not only the fighters but also the children. If they are not rehabilitated in their countries of origin, they will be ticking time-bombs.”

Adding: “We did our duty here in this region. These countries should do their duty as well and take their citizens and judge them and take their wives and children too.”

Britain’s Home Minister, Sajid David, took the unprecedented step last week of revoking the citizenship of teenager Shamima Begum, who fled London at age 15, with two girlfriends, to join the Islamic State. Now 19, Begum gave birth to a baby boy last Sunday — named Jerah, after at 7th century Islamic warlord. The father is a Dutch-born jihadi.

Begum has been ever so busy giving interviews to British journalists, pleading for rescue, although attracting little sympathy.

“I feel like I’ve been discriminated against because everyone was saying I was a poster girl for ISIS,” she told the BBC. “I’m being made an example of. I’m being punished right now because I’m famous.”

The imprisoned Dutch husband, Begum selected him after, she claims, giving ISIS a list of requirements in a husband, most importantly that he speak English. “When I first saw him, I was like, ‘OK, yeah, he is good looking … He told me that he was strict and he wanted a good house wife that stays inside. He didn’t want someone who is Westernized and wants to always go out and stuff.”

Begum shares her tent with the aforementioned Canadian woman, Dura Ahmed and her child.

The Begum family, who say they “do not recognize” the deeply damaged and purportedly brainwashed Shamima, but nevertheless support the girl and have hired a lawyer to fight stripping of citizenship from her.

South of the border, President Donald Trump, while criticizing other countries for not taking back nationals scooped off the battlefield, insists the U.S. won’t readmit Alabama-raised 24-year-old Hoda Muthana and her jihadi-sired baby. The convenient excuse is that Muthana’s father was a Yemeni diplomat at the time of her birth in New Jersey and thus not an American citizen — a view shared by the Obama administration that revoked her U.S. passport when she left for Syria in 2014.

“I interpreted everything wrong,” said Muthana. “I’m a normal human being who was manipulated.”

Apart from the firmly unrepentant, it’s what they all claim, the ISIS camp-followers who now want to come “home,” their misadventures behind them, some readily acknowledging they should be tried and sent to prison, although it’s unclear for what offences; perhaps material support to a terrorist organization.

Professing their ignorance, they portray themselves as no more responsible for their poor judgment than the children they’ve borne.

But, repugnant as they may be — the Kimberlys and the Duras and the Amys — they can’t be left to rot in war and refugee camps. Certainly their children are victims deserving of deliverance. And children shouldn’t be separated from mothers.

A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, Justin Trudeau said before the last election.

41,,2019-02-27T13:50:00.0000000Z,Q: Are you worried Canada will fail to meet its international ... and he’ll be surprised at the next election.,"Former NDP Leader Tom Mulcair delivered a sobering yet inspiring message on the environment to high school students assembled at a Model United Nations forum at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School last Wednesday.

Addressing students who were tackling global issues of climate change and human trafficking at a two-day forum, Mulcair said Canada has failed to live up to its international obligations to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

He said this country has the worst record for greenhouse gases per capita among the world’s G20 economies, and noted that “Canada was the first country in the world to withdraw from Kyoto (Protocol in 1997).”

Mulcair said that successive Canadian governments — both Liberal and Conservative — have failed to deliver on GHG reduction targets.

But Mulcair, who once served as Quebec’s environment minister in the government of Jean Charest, also admitted his generation came up short in thwarting climate change.

“I’ll make an admission to you: My generation has failed. All you have to do is look at the figures for Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions. We have failed. We have failed you and we have failed your kids, and we failed your grandchildren. And we failed the planet.”

Mulcair, who lives in the West Island, said his generation is “passing the torch” to the youth of today. “We’ve got to rely on you to do better than we did.”

Afterward, Mulcair answered questions about the environment from the Montreal Gazette.

Q: You studied ecology at Vanier College in 1971. Your generation was probably one of the most idealistic, but admittedly didn’t get it done. Where did it go wrong? Is corporate pressure just too strong?

A: Corporate pressure is extremely strong. All you have to do is look at the recent firing of a researcher in Quebec City who was trying to tell people that the research into pesticide use in Quebec was being manipulated by the companies that manufacture pesticides. So that’s a concrete example of the physical environment. One of the challenges of global warming and greenhouse gases is it’s ethereal, it’s less palpable, it’s less immediate. We can know we’re getting more floods because we’re getting them here in Pierrefonds.

Q: You were an environment minister and knew these issues inside out. Why did governments fail?

A: I would say the number No. 1 reason is we haven’t set an obligation of result. So I’m very proud to say that when I was the environment minister every year I was able to reduce greenhouse gases in Quebec which is a big place with a large economy. But you have to have a single-minded determination to get to the result. And federally we keep signing agreements like Kyoto, but we were the first country in the world to withdraw. And we’ve consistently missed our targets. We went to Paris in 2015 and (Justin Trudeau) showed a lot of hope for Canada but we still don’t have a plan in place that will allow us to meet our obligations.

So the 1.5 C degree (reduction) hope of the Paris agreement, I think, is lost. The 2 C degree dire scenario of Paris, unfortunately, is going to be a reality. So those young people are the hope for the future. They know how real climate change is. They’ve got to get involved.

Q: Are you worried Canada will fail to meet its international environmental obligations?

A: Well, I’m going on a by case-by-case basis but I’m very worried, for example, about Abitibi-Témiscamingue where there is an Australian mining company that wants to open a lithium mine by the most pristine water in the world, the esker water, which is magnificent spring water. Again, it’s a false argument. They’re going to say its economic activity they’re bringing, but the esker also provides jobs.

With regard to greenhouse gases, you have to have a fixed cap. It’s not negotiable and you couldn’t, for example, in the case of Quebec, approve as the Liberal government did, a cement company in the Gaspé that completely blew the lid off our greenhouse gas emissions. We’re missing our targets because of that one bone-headed decision which has turned out to be an economically bone-headed decision as well.

Q: Are you worried the CAQ government of François Legault will not live up to its environmental obligations?

A: I’m actually more hopeful about the Legault government despite their right-wing bent economically.

The scandal “has become the biggest crisis of Trudeau ...","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is rebuffing demands for his resignation over claims that government officials pressured his then-justice minister to help a major company avoid a corruption trial reports The Week.

In what The Guardian described as a “searing testimony” to a committee in Canada’s House of Commons, Jody Wilson-Raybould described a “consistent, sustained and inappropriate effort” by senior officials close to Trudeau to dissuade her from prosecuting Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin over accusations of fraud and bribery.

The former minister of justice and attorney general said the alleged pressure campaign included “veiled threats” by the officials, who feared the company might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

Wilson-Raybould claimed that the head of the federal civil service told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

However, under questioning from legislators from the ruling Liberal Party, the former minister said did not feel the pressure exercised on her had crossed the line into illegality.

Earlier this month, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that aides close to the PM had lobbied Wilson-Raybould to pursue a “deferred prosecution agreement” against SNC-Lavalin that would allow the company to escape with a fine. This allegation “forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts”, reports Reuters.

Wilson-Raybould was demoted unexpectedly in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She told the committee that she believes the SNC-Lavalin case prompted her demotion.

Following the hearing, Canadian opposition leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to resign.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” said the Conservative Party leader. “And that is why I am calling on Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.”

But Trudeau told a press conference in Quebec on Wednesday that he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of events.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” he said, adding that Canadians would have their say on his administration in the upcoming federal election, in October.

Crisis

The scandal “has become the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s administration”, says The Guardian.

SNC-Lavalin, one of the world’s largest engineering and construction companies, is facing fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m “in bribes it is alleged to have offfered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011”, reports the BBC.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will “vigorously defend itself” against the allegations.

The row has raised questions about whether the Trudeau government behaved in a way “that was ethically or legally problematic”, says The Globe and Mail. Canadians “have a right to answers” and “if they don’t like them, things could turn out very badly for the Trudeau government”, the newspaper adds.

The Choices

But Hamish Telford, a political science professor at British Columbia’s University of the Fraser Valley, told Vancouver-based site CityNews that despite Wilson-Raybould’s seemingly damning testimony, Trudeau is likely to continue as usual and wait for the election.

“Maybe Justin Trudeau feels fairly confident that once people are making the choice between him and Andrew Scheer and [New Democratic Party candidate] Jagmeet Singh, that we’ll choose him,” Telford said.",MEDIAWATCH:Canada PM rejects resignation call,Newsroom Panama,https://www.newsroompanama.com/media-watch/mediawatchcanada-pm-rejects-resignation-call

Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is facing the biggest political scandal of his administration. The affair centres around allegations that his former attorney general, Jody-Wilson Raybould, was improperly pressured by some of his closest advisers to prevent the prosecution of a large Canadian engineering firm over accusations of fraud and bribery. Thus far, the scandal has been politically costly; Gerald Butts, a longtime friend of Trudeau’s, and his closest adviser, resigned two weeks ago . Wilson-Raybould has resigned, too. A handful of polls are showing the scandal is politically unpopular for the governing Liberals – which is worrying for them, given there is a federal election in October.

What is the company accused of?

SNC-Lavalin, based in Montreal, is accused of paying C$48m worth of bribes in Libya to Muammar Gaddafi’s family, in order to secure lucrative contracts. The bribery is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2011. If found guilty, the company would be barred from bidding on federal projects for a decade. SNC-Lavalin employs nearly 50,000 people worldwide, with 3,400 in Quebec.

Trudeau denies wrongdoing and says ex-minister could be ousted from party Read more

Company executives have been lobbying fora “deferred prosecution agreement”, which in effect allows them to pay a fine in lieu of a criminal prosecution, with no ban on bidding for contracts. But federal prosectors have decided to pursue a trial.

This is where the scandal is centred: the prime minister and his aides, along with the finance minister, have been accused of pressing Wilson-Raybould to intervene and asking prosecutors to accept a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould declined to override the judgment of her top legal team.

What does the former attorney general say?

In searing testimony in front of parliament’s justice committee, Wilson-Raybould detailed “ consistent and sustained” efforts to change her mind. Despite repeated assertions by Wilson-Raybould that she would not bend, she told a justice committee on Wednesday the pressure intensified – and included “veiled threats” by aides that she was on course for a clash with the prime minister. She said that while it was proper for ministers and their staff to consult her about protecting jobs, it was inappropriate for her to make decisions based on “partisan political considerations”. Her testimony also marked the first public assertion that Trudeau lobbied her – to the point that she felt obliged to warn him what he was asking was improper.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has not denied that he and his team spoke to Wilson-Raybould and her staff about SNC-Lavalin. He says all of their discussions were respectful and within the bounds of the rules. On Thursday, he reiterated his belief that as prime minister, it is his job and duty to protect the jobs of Canadians – likely a reference to the potential for job losses in the event of a conviction.

Is it a big deal?

The leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, has called on Trudeau to resign –something Trudeau has rejected. Other political leaders have called for more investigations into the affair – and the country’s ethics commissioner is investigating. But at the justice committee hearing on Wednesday, members of Trudeau’s Liberal party appeared as unified; there have been no high-profile shows of public support for Wilson-Raybould within the party since Wednesday.

On Thursday, Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was on the front page of every major paper in the country, with most running large, dramatic photos of the defiant former attorney general. “I Said ‘No’, My Mind Had Been Made Up,” said the National Post. “Wilson-Raybould Speaks Her Truth,” said the Toronto Star. “Wilson-Raybould points accusing finger at PM,” said the Vancouver Sun. And the Globe and Mail, which broke the story, ran with the headline: “An effort to politically interfere.”

What happens next?

A number of figures have requested to testify before the justice committee, including Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former adviser and Michael Wernick, the country’s top public servant. Both were present in many of the discussions – and both have publicly stated previously they did nothing wrong. The prime minister has also said he would consider the future of Wilson-Raybould in the party.

With a provincial election scheduled for this spring, his New Democratic ...","Natural gas royalties have faded to account for just one-fifth of government profits that also include gambling, liquor and recently legalized marijuana in Canada’s chief energy-producing province.

Alberta treasury accounts released Wednesday forecast gas royalties will shrink to C$466 million ($350 million) for the 2018-19 fiscal year that ends March 31.

Five times more revenue -- C$2.3 billion ($1.7 billion) -- is projected from sponsorship, distribution, sales and taxation of popular personal habits fulfilled by the government agency Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (AGLC).

The 2018-19 provincial gas royalty forecast dwindles to C$199 million ($149 million) or 31% off the C$645 million ($484 million) collected in 2017-18.

The dim current-year outlook is 95% below the provincial gas royalty peak of C$8.5 billion ($6.4 billion) in 2005-06. At the time, Alberta production fetched an annual average of C$8.42/MMBtu ($6.32/MMBtu) and gas royalties stood out as the provincial treasury’s top earner.

The Alberta government supports producers in gas pipeline expansion and toll reduction cases before the National Energy Board (NEB). But prices remain low due to a Canadian supply glut and competition from abundant unconventional production in the United States.

The treasury accounts register a severe drop by the provincial gas benchmark, the Alberta Reference Price (ARP) -- a weighted average of production for all destinations compiled by the government for royalty collection purposes.

For 2018-19, the ARP has fallen to C$1.15 per gigajoule ($0.90/MMBtu) -- down by 37% from the 2017-18 average of C$1.82/GJ ($1.43/MMBtu), which was already 78% below the 2005-06 peak.

Strong oil prices in the first half of 2018-19, propped up by the province with enforced production cuts, partially offset the downward spiral by natural gas, shows the treasury’s quarterly statement released by Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci.

With a provincial election scheduled for this spring, his New Democratic Party (NDP) regime’s financial update predicts treasury revenues will “improve significantly” starting in 2021, after one more lean spell in the 2019-20 fiscal year that starts April 1.

As of 2023-24, when the NDP vows to eliminate provincial budget deficits if re-elected, Ceci’s forecast shows total Alberta government oil and gas revenues, including drilling and production rights sales, jumping by 124% to C$12.3 billion ($9.2 billion). Provincial spending is projected to grow by a far lower 18% to C$66.5 billion ($50 billion).","Drinking and Gambling Outpace Oil, NatGas Revenues in Canada's Top-Producing Province",Natural Gas Intel,https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/117581-drinking-and-gambling-outpace-oil-natgas-revenues-in-canadas-top-producing-province

After a week of media reports of internal dissent over his leadership, Atallah called it quits Friday, publishing a long letter of resignation on his personal Facebook page.

Off the top he says the October election, which saw the Liberals lose power to the Coalition Avenir Québec, did not end the way he wanted it to and he assumes his share of the blame.

He does not address the controversy over his leadership directly except to say that, in his mind, the party needs unity and he considers his job reforming the structures of the 150-year-old party complete.

But he says some of the reforms put in place have rendered the party “extremely bureaucratic,” making it difficult for a volunteer officer like himself to put in place a real vision.

Radio-Canada, however, reported Friday that the Liberal caucus of elected MNAs itself asked for Atallah’s resignation.

His resignation follows a tumultuous meeting last weekend in Bécancour of the party’s 125 riding presidents where a rift emerged over how fast to proceed with a leadership race to replace Philippe Couillard, who resigned after the 2018 election defeat.

The executive, including Atallah, had wanted the meeting to be a general discussion on the future of the Liberal Party but a group of riding presidents spoke in favour of a speedier leadership process.

Some said it is hard for the party to go about the business of developing a new program without knowing the vision of the new leader.

The party, for example, just opted to stick with its traditional position on no restrictions on religious symbols despite the fact some believe taking a harder line might be a way to woo more nationalist votes back to the party.

Faced with the revolt, party interim leader Pierre Arcand announced the leadership race rules would be revealed at a meeting of the party general council May 4-5 in Drummondville.

On Friday, Arcand issued a statement thanking Atallah, who got involved in the party at age 17 and is now 32, for his years of service to the party.

He added the party’s current vice-president, Katherine Martin, will act as party president in the interim until the Liberal executive decides who will replace Atallah.

Atallah is the second big party name to step down in the wake of the election defeat. Businessman Alexandre Taillefer, who acted as party election campaign chairman, quit politics altogether after the vote.

The field of potential Liberal leadership candidates recently narrowed.

The deposed Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was hardly exposed to a court-style cross this week, but make no mistake: She’s come a hell of a lot closer to it than any of the other sorry players in the SNC-Lavalin imbroglio. She emerged whole, and her evidence had the wonderful and unmistakable ring of truth.

At the Justice Committee Wednesday, she was cogent and detailed, with names and dates and some contemporaneously made notes and/or emails and texts to help her already-clear memory. She was thoughtful and responsive to the questions.

Then look at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger and all the other Liberal MPs who nod like those bobble-heads you see in the back windows of cars — and with approximately the same intelligence.

Since this scandal broke, the PM has been completely unresponsive to Opposition questions in Question Period (when he has deigned to appear), reciting instead the pap he has force-fed Chagger et al about “always standing up for jobs” while simultaneously “respecting Canadian institutions.”

Even Morneau was reduced to saying this Thursday, before he bolted from a group of reporters.

Among them, the Liberals have said this probably 100 times and I still don’t understand how the Speaker lets them get away with it or what it means — except that what they mean are SNC-Lavalin jobs.

One of the tiny, telling details from Wilson-Raybould’s evidence was how, when making the case for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for SNC-Lavalin, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick brought up the fact that the company had “a board meeting on Thursday with stockholders.”

(This was at a meeting Wilson-Raybould had Sept. 17, 2018 with Wernick and Trudeau, at a point when Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel had already decided not to offer a DPA, and Wilson-Raybould had decided it was not appropriate for her to intervene.)

Even if one accepts that it was A-OK for Trudeau and his minions to badger Wilson-Raybould into changing her mind – and she didn’t, and told the pair of them they were out of line, as indeed they were — why on Earth was Wernick so acutely aware of SNC’s business timelines?

He did it again two days later, at a second meeting Trudeau insisted Wilson-Raybould have with Wernick, mentioning again the upcoming SNC meeting, telling her that its lawyer, Frank Iacobucci (a former Supreme Court judge), was “no shrinking violet” and that he, Wernick, understood SNC was “going back and forth with” Roussel.

Why all this effort on behalf of SNC?

Well, the benign explanation is that DPAs are meant to spare innocent parties – workers, shareholders, pensioners – from paying the price for the corporate malfeasance of a few. Like plea bargains for individuals, DPAs are pragmatic tools for prosecutors.

And SNC-Lavalin, under its current CEO Neil Bruce and previous CEO Robert Card, has made much of how they have changed the corporate culture at the company, brought in a big broom and fired anyone remotely associated with bad behaviour and developed a whole ethical regime.

Why on Earth was Michael Wernick so acutely aware of SNC’s business timelines?

This is all to the good, if so.

But consider the company’s very checkered past, not all of it so long ago.

In 2016, on the heels of the Charbonneau inquiry into the construction industry in Quebec, SNC-Lavalin entered into a “voluntary reimbursement program” with the Quebec government.

According to Justice Quebec, this was a two-year program “to ensure mainly the recovery of amounts improperly paid as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics in connection with public contracts.” After paying back the monies owed, “participants could obtain a discharge that protected them from civil proceedings for fraud or fraudulent tactics” in connection with getting a public contract.

In October 2015, SNC-Lavalin reached a settlement with the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) “regarding allegations of sanctionable practices” by a subsidiary of the company in connection with two AfDB-financed projects, one in Uganda, the other in Mozambique.

According to the AfDB press release, the agreement “resolves allegations uncontested by the company of illicit payments ordered by former SNC International Inc. employees to public officials in order to secure contracts.”

Under the terms of the agreement, AfDB imposed “a conditional non-debarment (debarring prevents a company getting public contracts) … for a period of two years and 10 months” and repayment of $1.5 million.

The projects dated to October 2008 and December 2010.

More recently, in September 2016, SNC-Lavalin entered into a “compliance agreement” with the Commissioner of Elections Canada for illegal contributions made to federal political entities between March 9, 2004 and May 1, 2011.

According to the agreement on the Commissioner’s website, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. reimbursed $117,803.49 for illegal contributions, almost all of which had gone to the Liberal Party of Canada, various Liberal riding associations and contestants in the Liberal Party’s 2006 leadership race. The rest, $8,200, was tossed the way of the Conservative Party. (The company was reimbursing employees for contributions it had wanted them to make.)

And, of course, there’s the World Bank debarment of SNC-Lavalin, and 100 affiliates, for a period of 10 years.

That happened in April 2013, and, according to the World Bank press release, it was related to the company’s “misconduct in relation to the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in Bangladesh,” as well as unspecified misconduct in relation to another World Bank-financed Rural Electrification and Transmission project in Cambodia.

None of that much mattered when it came to giving SNC-Lavalin a pass.

In December 2015, less than two months after the Liberals came to power, SNC signed an “administrative agreement” with the federal government, allowing it to bid and win work despite the criminal charges still pending.

These fraud and bribery charges date back to 2000-2011, for its alleged $48-million worth of bribery in Libya, which are now in different ways before two Canadian courts.

As of Thursday, according to the Public Services and Procurement website, SNC-Lavalin is the only supplier in the country with such an agreement.

Just how stupid do the Liberals think Canadians are?

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the public support on Thursday of a top political ally, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over a deepening political scandal.

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

""Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,"" she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal ""to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.""

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau's then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould's remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau's leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau's team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

""The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,"" said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that ""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that's exactly what we have done ... we've also done it in a way that has respected our laws"".

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

“I’m sure they would have some concern and some fear – fear – of Canadians beginning to breathe down their necks,” David Johnson of Cape Breton University said Thursday about the public’s reaction to Raybould’s claim of facing “inappropriate” pressure from within the Liberal government to intervene in a criminal case against the Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin. Johnson noted the latest polls still have the federal Liberals dominating in Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador. “Where there is some growing concern of Conservative strength is in Anglo New Brunswick,” he said. “That’s where the Conservatives are picking up some possibilities of picking off some Liberal seats.”

Speaking to reporters in Montreal on Wednesday, Trudeau disputed what Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons Justice Committee over almost four hours of stunning testimony. The former attorney general said several high-ranking officials — including Trudeau himself — pressed her to consider overruling Canada’s top prosecutor by offering SNC-Lavalin an agreement to avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and corruption charges. Wednesday was the first time she spoke in detail about the situation since controversy erupted over alleged political interference earlier this month. Johnson said we’ll know in the next couple of months whether the scandal does real damage to the party nationally, including here in Atlantic Canada. He said what the government does have going for it now is that a federal election is still eight months away. “If Justin Trudeau was facing a fixed election date of the spring, he would be sweating much more,” Johnson said. “I always say to my students when we talk about this, ‘What was the big political issue six months ago.’ When you try and think back six months and what was the big political issue …. Most people cannot come up with a quick answer.” Dr. Howard Ramos, a professor with Dalhousie University's Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology in Halifax, isn’t as convinced that the eight-month time frame won’t have an impact on party support.

He said what concerns him most is that voters simply won’t vote at all. “I don’t think Canadians are facing a slate of people running for prime minister that they are overly excited about. And when that happens, it tends to lead to voter turnout. That’s something to watch for in Atlantic Canada,” Ramos said. “Will young people vote? This certainly is not going to help on that front.

“If this discourages millennials from voting, which was a big component of Liberal support, if it discourages women from voting, that was a base for Liberals as well, if it discourages progressives who would’ve moved from the NDP .... that in turn will lead to a race where (it’s less known) what will happen.” Ramos referred to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as “compelling” and said it’s now a “high-stakes game of chicken” between her and Trudeau on who will flinch first in terms of her staying within caucus. “For Liberal MPs in the region, it certainly presents an obstacle moving forward in the series of months leading to the election,” he said. “The best tactic they can take is to distance themselves from the party and campaign on what they’ve done for the region and what they do as MPs themselves.” Philip Croucher is a reporter and Star bureau chief based in Halifax.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.","Top ally supports embattled Canada PM, easing pressure for now",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1QH215-OCADN

Lavalin would be banned from federal business in Canada. ""For a period of approximately four months, between ...","OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reconsidering Jody Wilson-Raybould's future in the Liberal party after his former attorney general accused him, his senior staff and the country's top civil servant of putting her under relentless pressure to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and refused to say whether she still believes in his leadership.

""I completely disagree with the former attorney general's characterization of events,"" Trudeau said in Montreal, shortly after Wilson-Raybould concluded four hours of explosive testimony before the House of Commons justice committee. ""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said he will review all of Wilson-Raybould's testimony before deciding whether she can remain in the Liberal caucus or seek re-election this fall as a Liberal candidate.

Wilson-Raybould reiterated her intention to remain part of the Liberal team as she exited the committee room, even though she refused during questioning to say whether she still had confidence in the leader of that team.

""I'm not sure how that question is relevant,"" she said when asked by a Liberal colleague if she still has confidence in the prime minister.

During her testimony, which drew gasps from opposition MPs and the overflow crowd of observers in the committee room, Wilson-Raybould said she believes Trudeau shuffled her out the prestigious justice portfolio in mid-January because she refused to give in to pressure — and even ""veiled threats"" — to order a halt to a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal engineering giant was, and is, facing charges of fraud and corruption related to attempts to get business in Libya. A ""remediation agreement,"" a sort of plea bargain, would have headed off a trial and removed the possibility SNC-Lavalin would be banned from federal business in Canada.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould provided a detailed accounting of meetings and phone calls to back up her accusations, breaking three weeks of silence on the affair that has rocked the government, prompting her resignation from cabinet and the departure of Trudeau's most trusted adviser, Gerald Butts.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, speaking immediately after Wilson-Raybould's testimony finished, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern the country and should resign. He also called for a police investigation of Wilson-Raybould's claims.

The former minister told the committee she was ""hounded"" to end the prosecution for months after the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, had rejected the idea of negotiating a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin and long after she had unequivocally declared that she would not direct Roussel to reverse her decision.

While she believed it was inappropriate, Wilson-Raybould said she didn't consider the pressure to be illegal. She did not resign or directly raise her concerns with Trudeau after Sept. 17, when she first informed him that she would not intervene in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

She said she didn't speak directly to Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin again until Jan. 7, when he informed her he was about to move her out of the justice portfolio; she suggested the move was the result of her refusal to intervene in the prosecution, which he denied. She accepted a move to veterans affairs on Jan. 14 and did not resign from cabinet until Feb. 11, five days after an anonymously sourced allegation that she'd been improperly pressured first surfaced in the Globe and Mail.

""At the time, I did not see it as my responsibility to resign. I saw myself as the attorney general of the country who was doing her job to ensure and uphold the independence of the prosecutor and uphold the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

51,,2019-02-28T16:50:00.0000000Z,SAINT-HUBERT — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated that he did not agree with “the characterization of events” that Canada’s ... and the Liberal Party in general in Quebec.,"SAINT-HUBERT — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated that he did not agree with “the characterization of events” that Canada’s former attorney-general presented in damning testimony Wednesday, adding that the government is still in reflection on whether former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould will remain within the Liberal caucus.

“I and my team always acted in an appropriate and professional manner,” Trudeau said Thursday morning at a press conference that was supposed to be about interstellar exploration at the Canadian Space Agency in St-Hubert but was overshadowed by the SNC-Lavalin scandal. “So I am not in agreement with the characterization of events that the former attorney general gave in her testimony. We have always defended and looked to protect jobs in Canada and we will always do so.”

Trudeau said the RCMP has not contacted him or other government officials about the affair, to his knowledge. On Thursday, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said he urged the head of the RCMP to launch an investigation, contending that the Liberals broke laws under the Criminal Code related to obstructing justice and interfering with the attorney-general. He also repeated calls for Trudeau to step down.

Asked who was telling the truth, Trudeau said the government’s ethics commissioner is investigating and will come to a conclusion. Federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion started his investigation two weeks ago.

“Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge, who is an officer of Parliament, who will make a determination in this issue,” Trudeau said.

“So, while political parties and various people are trying to draw a lot of attention to this issue, there is a process, both through the justice committee and indeed the ethics commissioner, that will make a determination on what actually happened here.”

In testimony before the House of Commons Justice Committee, former justice minister Wilson-Raybould said senior levels of the federal government and the prime minister himself pressured her repeatedly for months and interfered politically in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Senior staff wanted her to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges over over allegations SNC paid millions in bribes to win government contracts in Libya, and move instead to negotiate a remediation agreement, she said. A guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin would mean the engineering-construction giant would be barred from bidding on federal procurement contracts for 10 years. SNC said the managers involved in the Libya deals are no longer with the company and it has tightened its ethics management.

Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau noted he was a Quebec MP, inferring there could be repercussions for him and the Liberal Party in general in Quebec.

Trudeau stressed on Thursday his main concern was to protect jobs, not his political future or that of his party.

“There were many and broad conversations about the importance of saving jobs, not just in Quebec but across the country,” Trudeau said.

“These are good jobs, and pensioners and people who rely on the kind of work that is being done in Canada and around the world. And my job as prime minister is always to stand up for good jobs, to invest in good jobs.”

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould was moved from her post as justice minister to veterans affairs in January, two weeks after she last rejected pressure from Trudeau’s staff to defer prosecution, because senior cabinet minister Scott Brison announced he was leaving politics, “which created a number of opportunities and consequences that we moved forward on.”

Asked if SNC-Lavalin threatened to move their head office from Montreal if they were subjected to criminal prosecution, Trudeau replied: “We know that there are many factors that go into decisions like that — we also know that it is pretty fundamental, that all Canadians expect of their governments to look for ways to protect jobs and ensure that we continue to grow the economy.”

Top ministers echoed the prime minister in separate appearances Thursday.

In Toronto, Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied that his chief of staff, Ben Chin, did anything inappropriate in discussing the SNC-Lavalin case with Wilson-Raybould’s staff.

“My staff, of course, is going to be constantly in communication with other teams across the government, always talking about the importance of the economy, always talking about the importance of jobs and that is their appropriate role,” Morneau said. “I think that Ben was acting entirely appropriately in that capacity.”

Morneau did not directly address Wilson-Raybould’s assertion that Chin pressured her staff to take into consideration the political impact on last fall’s Quebec election if SNC-Lavalin were to move its operations out of the country. He did say that he did not direct Chin to do that.

Morneau emphasized that the company employs 9,000 people across the country and thousands of pensioners are dependent on its continued operation. It was appropriate to take that into consideration, while respecting the rule of law, he said.

In a speech to the Empire Club of Canada, Wilson-Raybould’s successor as justice minister and attorney general, David Lametti, said her testimony was an extraordinary symbol of transparency in the government. He also said it’s useful for the attorney general to sit at the cabinet table — unlike in some other jurisdictions, where the attorney general and justice minister are distinct.

“Just like the world outside politics, each of us is made stronger by talking to each other and coming to better understandings together,” he said. “I believe that these discussions can improve the quality of decision making. The attorney-general is not an island, even in circumstances where a final decision rests with him or her.”

While Trudeau and his ministers seemed intent on projecting a business-as-usual confidence, the Conservatives requested an emergency debate in the House of Commons Thursday on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. The NDP supported the request, which was granted by Speaker Geoff Regan.

Trudeau came to the Canadian Space Agency to announce Canada would be joining the U.S.-led Lunar Gateway program that aims to place laboratories on the moon. Canada will be developing a new Canadarm — the Canadarm3 — to help with construction and exploration on the moon, and will be investing $2 billion over the next 24 years in space exploration.

52,LifeStyle,2019-03-01T03:24:00.0000000Z,"Calgary Indigenous rights advocate Michelle Robinson, who is of the Dene nation, oversees membership for the Indigenous Peoples’ Commission for the Liberal Party of Canada. She told the Star she is “definitely concerned” about how Wilson-Raybould ...","It was around 1945, when he was six years old. His family took a photograph of him there, which he’s kept for more than 70 years.

Robert Joseph remembers the first time his Kwakiutl family brought him to a ceremony at the Big House on Village Island, just off the northeast tip of Vancouver Island.

Chief Joseph, 79, spoke a day after a fellow member of the Kwakiutl nation testified before the House of Commons justice committee about allegations of political interference when she was attorney general.

“It wasn’t drama or theatre; they were real to a six-year-old. And that experience was so important because you begin to grow up and realize it was all a re-enactment of our belief systems, our history and our spirituality.”

“I remember it because it was so magical,” the hereditary potlatch chief of the Thunderbird clan told the Star on Thursday. “As a little kid, you’d see all these dancers, their paraphernalia and masks.

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that when she refused to bow to pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to cut Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a break on corruption charges, she was demoted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he “ completely disagreed ” with her characterization of what happened and insisted his staff acted appropriately.

That remark might have gone over the heads of Canadians unfamiliar with West Coast Indigenous cultures, but for her fellow Kwakiutl nation people — also known as Kwakwaka’wakw — the message was crystal clear.

In Wilson-Raybould’s closing statement, she stated she “came from a long line of matriarchs, and I’m a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our Big House. This is who I am, and this is who I always will be.”

“But the Big House is actually both a metaphor and a building at the same time. It’s a metaphor for our world in the broadest sense. Everything in us and about us is contained in the Big House.”

“The Big House is in a sense our Parliament building, used by the hereditary chiefs, the heads of all the clans and houses,” he said. “It is our governance instrument, our central governing institution.

The Big House , explained Chief Joseph, is where everything important to the nation takes place, from decision making and conflict resolution to oral history and commerce.

It was a statement about where she derives her authority, not merely as former attorney general, to take the stance she has.

John Borrows, founder of the University of Victoria’s Indigenous Law program — the first of its kind in the world — taught Wilson-Raybould law at the University of B.C. He said her reference to the Big House in her testimony Wednesday was no accident, paired with her insistence that the words you use matter and must be used with care.

“We saw Canada’s Indigenous constitution in action,” Borrows said, invoking the name of a book he wrote. “We more often see it in the treaty or Aboriginal rights context, but here it came out in cabinet. Indigenous law is not just something on the floor of the Big House but also on the floor of a parliamentary committee.”

Borrows, from the Anishinaabe nation of Ontario, took part in several Kwakiutl Big House ceremonies and described one he was invited to in Alert Bay, B.C.

Rows of benches line the walls like bleachers on three sides, the fourth featuring an elaborately painted screen in front of which dancers share stories and histories of the nation. Big Houses, he added, are used for everything from preserving oral history to bestowing ceremonial names and titles to resolving conflicts in Kwakiutl family law.

“I’ve attended a couple of their gatherings,” Borrows recalled. “It’s a lot about witnessing and checks-and-balances. There’s a speaker hired who gives the overarching narrative, but there are other family members also involved in conveying a narrative that is the history of the nation through song, dance and word.

“It’s beautiful as people go across the Big House floor … It’s very, very involved and can be a 16-hour experience of how the people relate to their territory.”

By the entrance of the Big House, representatives of the nation’s traditional clan system, each representing an important animal or being to that family, stand in regalia with “dramatic” carved masks. At various points they step in to comment or participate, sharing their clan’s historical connection to the proceedings.

Another key theme in Wilson-Raybould’s speech was her family lineage, including what she was taught by her father, mother and relatives, as well as her traditional name, Puglaas. According to Chief Joseph, the name means “a place one goes for fulfilment or to receive knowledge” and is a “very important name” to her people. “Her granny and the other elders and matriarchs,” he said, needed great faith that she would live up to its obligations.

“It is in that Big House that people are given names,” professor Borrows said. “And you have to keep your name ‘clean,’ to uphold the name when you speak and to always speak plainly.

He explained that, as the Big House is an official decision-making body, her name carries with it certain responsibilities she must uphold.

“People assume land and territorial obligations in the Big House. What Jody is doing is drawing on that tradition of intervening, checks-and-balances, speaking plainly and keeping the long genealogy of the legal system in the minds of people.”

Meanwhile, Indigenous people far beyond Wilson-Raybould’s own nation saw an important message in her remarks Wednesday.

Calgary Indigenous rights advocate Michelle Robinson, who is of the Dene nation, oversees membership for the Indigenous Peoples’ Commission for the Liberal Party of Canada. She told the Star she is “definitely concerned” about how Wilson-Raybould could be treated in the wake of her explosive remarks.

“I worry about why it is so many folks don’t understand what she did was a positive thing for Canada and for democracy,” Robinson said.

“Instead, a lot of party loyalists and other folks are dogging on her. I think it’s really rooted in that hate against Indigenous women. We just can’t seem to get past that bias, no matter how incredibly accomplished this woman is.”

Bias against Indigenous women is unaddressed in Canada and is manifesting itself throughout this entire affair, she argued. But Robinson also said a broad range of Indigenous people were proud to hear the testimony.

“She represented her nation with such dignity and conviction,” she said. “I think that her nation should be applauded for what happened yesterday, because they taught her how to be this incredibly strong woman.

“Her people raised her from the moment she was born to be a very strong voice for her nation specifically, and I think that was really showcased yesterday … She’s an incredible role model for all Indigenous people.”

Heather Dorries, an assistant professor of public policy at Carleton University, noted that the Liberal government said it made Indigenous relationships a central priority. Those statements are being contrasted with the government’s actions — and raising questions.

“I think that the actions of this government confirm what many Indigenous Peoples have known for a long time,” Dorries told the Star by email. “That Canada will not uphold the rule of law if it is not politically expedient.

“This affair demonstrates that ultimately protecting a narrow set of economic interests is this government’s greatest priority.”

Speaking to the Star by phone Thursday, Judith Sayers — a prominent B.C. lawyer and president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council on Vancouver Island — pointed to Wilson-Raybould’s Indigenous heritage as a guiding path for her decision to speak at the Commons justice committee.

“As Indigenous people, the rule of law has always been used against us,” she explained. “She knew what her job was, she knew the power and authority she had, and made up her mind on something.”

Sayers said Indigenous people are typically subjected to the rule of Canadian law without their consent.

“When she was given that opportunity (to speak on the affair), her Indigenous laws, protocols and principles that she was raised with came out,” she said. “So she did what I think all the matriarchs ahead of her would have done.”

Sayers stressed the tight-knit nature of the Indigenous community and the effect that the SNC-Lavalin fallout is having on Indigenous people across the country.

“If (Trudeau) didn’t understand how closely connected the Indigenous community is, he is really not understanding Indigenous people at all,” Sayers said.

“Having this happen, I think it just brings so much more anger and disappointment ... No. 1, for having treated Jody the way he has, and it’s always going back to his line about Indigenous people being the most important relationship that he has. His actions have never lived up to his statement, and I think that this just proves it more.”

Canada banned the potlatch — a feast and gift-giving ceremony that forms the heart of many West Coast nations’ traditions — and other Big House rituals until 1951, along with outlawing Indigenous nations hiring lawyers to advocate for them. So on B.C.’s coast, numerous cultures held Big House potlatches illegally in secret.

“I was born in 1939, so I was old enough to attend some of the underground potlatches,” Chief Joseph recalled. “We lived in more isolated areas, so we didn’t have too much intrusion from newcomers and were almost unimpeded, but our neighbours who were in the direct path of colonization were going through severe challenges.”

When the Star visited Village Island last fall, it was overgrown with thickets of blackberry brambles and apple trees. There are signs of bears living among the ruins of homes, complete with wood stoves and no electric sockets or light fixtures.

Through the dense foliage, the ruin of a Big House — a monumental cedar crossbeam metres thick still standing atop two posts — acts as a reminder that the Indigenous governance system that endures today has been here many thousands of years.

“In the Big House, we feel connectedness over time, down through the millennia,” Chief Joseph said. “I was extremely moved by Jody’s testimony because she based it on our values. She was drawing from a lived experience that is millennia old — very, very deep knowledge.

“I was so, so proud of her.”

He said the prime minister no longer ...,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he still needs to think about Jody Wilson-Raybould’s future in the Liberal caucus after watching the former attorney general’s bombshell testimony that positioned Trudeau at the head of a top-down effort by senior government officials to pressure her into relieving SNC-Lavalin of its criminal charges.

“I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal on Thursday.

Wilson-Raybould provided the House Justice committee with a more than three-hour testimony Wednesday night about the events leading up to an explosive Globe and Mail story three weeks ago, when it was first reported that she had been pressured by officials in the Prime Minister’s Office to allow the Quebec construction giant to settle for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). The former attorney general told the committee that between September and December she experienced a “concerted and sustained effort” by 11 officials to interfere in her role. It also reached a point where she felt she was receiving “veiled threats” aimed at pressuring her into providing SNC-Lavalin a DPA.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the events shortly after her testimony.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally. I therefore completely disagree with the former attorney general’s characterization of events,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal.

After appearing at the Justice committee, Wilson-Raybould said she doesn’t expect to be removed from the Liberal Party.

“I don’t anticipate being kicked out of caucus. I was elected by the constituents of Vancouver Granville to represent them as a Liberal Member of Parliament,” she said.

After the Justice Committee meeting on Wednesday, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau to resign as Prime Minister of Canada. He said the prime minister no longer had the “moral authority” to lead the country. He also called for an RCMP investigation into the behaviour of Trudeau and the other officials named by Wilson-Raybould in her testimony. Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that to his knowledge, none of the 11 officials who Wilson-Raybould named as playing a part in the government’s attempt to pressure her had been contacted by the RCMP. Asked about a potential investigation on Thursday, the RCMP said they had no information to provide.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh reissued a call for a public inquiry into the allegations after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. He said “everything” was still on the table and that Trudeau “might need to resign” after an inquiry.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May also renewed her call for an independent investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair on Thursday. “In light of yesterday’s testimony from Ms. Wilson-Raybould, it is more urgent than ever that all the players in this sordid saga are called to account for their actions,” May said in a statement.

Among them, there’s this: we can never quite beat their political drama.

On Wednesday, however, Canada might have done it. While the testimony of Donald Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, transfixed the world, the reports originating out of an entirely different committee meeting in Ottawa may have been more scandalous.

Canada has always presented a good front of house: prim, stoic, orderly and well-managed. The kitchen is ankle-deep in grime and in dire need of pest control, but the backroom is easy to hide from happy patrons.

The scandal now unfolding in Ottawa – concerning just how far Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government was willing to go to save iconic Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin – is giving us all a peek behind that grubby little counter. It’s showing us what this country really is and for whom it actually runs.

According to Jody Wilson-Raybould – who confirmed the reporting by The Globe and Mail – the former justice minister and attorney-general “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion ... in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,"" she said in dramatic, hours-long testimony in front of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights on Wednesday. A DPA would allow the company to forgo a criminal trial for bribery for projects in Libya in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing and a fine.

Crass partisan electoral gain seemed to be at least the undertone of these conversations, she said. Occasionally it was even an overtone: One PMO staffer noted that SNC-Lavalin was threatening to move its headquarters from Montreal to a more congenial location abroad ahead of the federal election this fall, allegedly saying that “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.”

She said she felt that pressure over a number of months until the end of 2018, when Ms. Wilson-Raybould was suddenly demoted and replaced in her high-profile cabinet post by a member of Parliament from Montreal.

Mr. Trudeau delivered a brief statement on Wednesday night in Montreal, disagreeing with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We of course had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions,” he said.

No doubt, that focus will be welcome in some corners. But it should be noted that Mr. Trudeau is not the great defender of Canadian jobs, writ large, here.

He’s defending certain jobs. Not jobs in Oshawa, or northern Alberta, or Newfoundland – no, no, how quaint. Mr. Trudeau is passionate about the jobs that give lustre to a company that stands at the very firmament of the central Canadian elite, headquartered in a province with enormous psychological and electoral significance for the Liberals.

SNC-Lavalin provides the right sort of jobs, being the kind of company that knows the right sort of people: that is, the kind who can make a call that gets answered at the PMO.

One of these meetings about SNC-Lavalin took place with Mr. Trudeau himself, according to Ms. Wilson-Raybould: “At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec ... 'and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” She says she responded: “Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision, as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.”

“No, no, no,"" he allegedly said – ""we just need to find a solution.”

And all this, to save what? A company that has been mired in corruption scandals, both domestic and international, for decades. The World Bank Group blacklisted SNC-Lavalin and more than 100 of its affiliates for 10 years, meaning that Canadian businesses now dominate the bank’s list of companies sanctioned for fraud or corruption.

Now, a report from La Presse alleges that SNC-Lavalin paid tens of thousands of dollars for the services of prostitutes and naked dancers to entertain the son of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi during a tour of Canada in 2008.

Even Liberal die-hards aren’t really trying to defend this. The only recourse is this anemic plea for jobs, or to assure themselves that the Conservatives would be worse, probably.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s not hard to detect the nihilistic shrug behind all of this, though. This is the way it’s done – the way things have always been done. That’s how the country really runs. This is who it is run for.

Once you assure yourselves that the Other Guys would probably do the same, you’ve handed the Liberals, the “natural governing party of Canada,” the license to get away with anything.

And then they get away with everything.

Even though Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony didn’t involve porn-star hush-money or a convicted felon hurling broadsides at the sitting U.S. president, that revelation might just shock you even more.

They just cannot comprehend her.

This is also why Western anger at the Liberal government has become so intense. Mr. Trudeau and his kind have never understood the West, or cared to try. That indifference is coming home to roost.

Mr. Trudeau stoutly denied on Thursday that he sought to coerce his then-attorney-general into ordering a deferred-prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. He will not be resigning or calling an election. Nonetheless, it is clear that this government is in crisis.

How could the Liberals have bungled things so badly? The answer may lie in where Mr. Trudeau went to school.

The elites who govern this country come mostly from the same places – usually a city within the watershed of the St. Lawrence River – and went to the same universities: Western, Toronto, Queen’s, McGill, University of Montreal. They generally live in the same downtown neighbourhoods in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, and hold the same progressive but pragmatic views. On the big issues, they usually debate among themselves, reach a consensus, and implement that Laurentian Consensus, as some call it, through their preferred vehicle: the Liberal Party.

When the director of public prosecutions decided that SNC-Lavalin, a major Quebec employer, did not qualify for a deferred prosecution, the consensus quickly emerged: A conviction could bring down the company, which must not happen.

And so, according to Ms. Wilson-Rayboud’s testimony to the Commons justice committee, a senior adviser to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, senior staff in the Prime Minister’s office, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and the Prime Minister himself met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and her staff repeatedly to impress on them the dire political implications of not granting the firm a deferred-prosecution agreement. As she said Mathieu Bouchard, an adviser to the Prime Minister, put it: “We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to get re-elected.”

Mr. Bouchard attended McGill, and Mr. Morneau went to Western. Mr. Wernick is an alumnus of University of Toronto. Mr. Trudeau met Gerald Butts, his close friend and former personal secretary, when they were at McGill.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould was raised in Vancouver and Comox, B.C., and attended the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia. She is a member of the We Wai Kai Nation, and was regional chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations. As an Indigenous leader from British Columbia, she was three time zones and a world removed from the Laurentian elites.

This may be why Mr. Trudeau and his advisers were so unsuccessful in making Ms. Wilson-Raybould intervene to protect SNC-Lavalin. And it may be why they were unable to predict her actions after she was removed as attorney-general. They assumed she was a politician, a Liberal, and someone who understood that Canada was governed from the centre.

But she is not a politician – at least not a conventional one – she is a Liberal by convenience, and she has no particular attachment to the centre. She is, however, a former Crown attorney devoted to protecting the rule of law, a British Columbian and an Indigenous woman who I suspect took offence to all these Laurentian men trying to make her see things their way. Besides, what was SNC-Lavalin to her?

What is it to anyone in the West? The Liberals, based on the former attorney-general’s testimony, were willing to pervert the course of justice to protect 9,000 jobs at a Montreal-based engineering firm. But what about the tens of thousands of jobs lost in the oil patch thanks to this same government’s indifference to getting a pipeline to the sea?

Why did the Liberals buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and then not fight more aggressively in the courts and in the court of public opinion for the right to twin the line? Why are shovels not in the ground now that the National Energy Board has, yet again, approved the project? And why bring in new legislation, Bill C-69, that could make it virtually impossible to get any new energy project approved?

When he was younger, Mr. Trudeau studied and lived in B.C. John Duffy, a former Liberal strategist, once called him “the first post-Laurentian Liberal.” But Justin Trudeau is as Laurentian as Jody Wilson-Raybould is not. And that may be the nub of this thing.

Canada gets closer to a right to repair law

Meet a 12-year-old Canadian climate striker

Tidal power is literally making waves

The truth about Styrofoam

Is the right to repair ready for prime time?

(Michaela Rehle/Reuters)

When Michael Coteau's daughter dropped his Samsung Galaxy S8 this past fall, cracking it all over, the Ontario Liberal MPP kept using it for a while.

""But then it started irritating my ear, because the glass was kind of breaking apart,"" he said.

It's greener to repair such a device than recycle it and buy a new one — Nicole Mortillaro has pointed out how environmentally damaging it is to manufacture mobile devices. Recycling and disposal is also energy intensive, and many parts end up in the landfill.

But as CBC reported last fall, manufacturers often make it expensive and difficult to get devices repaired. They force customers to use ""authorized"" shops that often charge more than it would cost to buy a new device, restrict access to spare parts and manuals or even use software to render devices unusable if they've undergone ""unauthorized"" repair.

Coteau wanted to repair his Samsung, but given the aforementioned challenges, he ended up replacing it with a new phone. ""It's a waste,"" he said. ""It was a working device.""

These repair issues don't apply just to mobile devices, but increasingly to vehicles and smart appliances, from TVs to washing machines.

The good news is governments are starting to fight back with ""right to repair"" legislation. Last week, Coteau introduced a private member's bill amending Ontario's Consumer Protection Act that represents the first right to repair legislation ever proposed in Canada.

The bill would force brands to:

Provide consumers or electronics repair shops with replacement parts, software and tools for diagnosing, maintaining or repairing their products, for a fair price.

Provide electronic documents such as repair manuals for free.

Reset any electronic security that may disable the device during diagnosis, maintenance or repair.

Coteau said the goal is to reduce environmental waste, allow repairs to be made locally and encourage innovation.

The ""right to repair"" movement is picking up around the world for different kinds of products. Similar legislation for electronics is being considered in 18 U.S. states. A bill passed in Massachusetts in 2012 after a public referendum already requires car manufacturers to provide documents to allow anyone to repair their vehicles.

The U.S. also modified rules last fall allowing consumers to legally hack software in their devices as needed for repair and maintenance. In Europe, proposed right to repair legislation covers appliances such as fridges and washing machines.

Because Coteau isn't a member of Ontario's ruling party, his private member's bill may be stuck in debate for awhile.

In the meantime, here's some good news: ""Dumb"" devices — i.e. gadgets that don't contain a computer chip, like radios or blenders — can often be fixed for free at volunteer-run ""repair cafes"" across the country.

Meet a 12-year-old Canadian climate striker

(Andrew Gage)

If you've been following the news at all, you've likely heard about the youth-led protests worldwide in favour of greater climate action. The best-known participant is Sweden's Greta Thunberg, who has been skipping school every Friday since August to ""strike for climate."" The forthright 16-year-old, who has chastised adults at both the COP24 climate conference in December and the World Economic Forum in January, has inspired many young people — including 12-year-old Rebecca Wolf Gage (above).

Wolf Gage attends Shoreline Community Middle School in Victoria, and on the first Friday of every month, she and other students leave class and march down to the mayor's office to discuss local green initiatives.

What first inspired you to become involved in raising awareness of climate change?

My dad is very environmental, and he taught me about climate change from a young age. He inspires me almost every day, but didn't tell me to take on activism. Greta Thunberg also inspires me so much. If you have time to watch her interviews, please do. They are amazing! When I was five, I decided to support the Green Party even though my parents usually voted for a different party. That was when I realized that I was an environmental activist.

What has been the reaction of your teachers?

My teachers aren't supportive of me striking, but they're not unsympathetic. I have heard that some of the other strikers have less sympathetic teachers, and I'm lucky to have good ones at Shoreline Community Middle School.

Do you think your fellow students understand the importance of stopping climate change?

I find that most of my classmates either don't think that climate change is a big deal, or don't think there's any way to stop it. But I have a lot of friends who I strike with that are as passionate as I am about stopping climate change.

What sorts of climate-friendly ideas have you pitched to the mayor?

We started meeting with the mayor two months ago. Lisa Helps is the best mayor I've ever met around environmental issues. Many of us have addressed the CRD [Capital Regional District] board, where they announced the climate emergency resolution, brought forward by Mayor Helps. We have also set a goal of getting free bus passes for kids 18 and under throughout the CRD.

What are you planning in the coming months to keep this issue on people's minds?

For the coming months, we're going to try to advertise the climate strike as much as possible. On May 3, it's a huge national climate strike. In the summer, we are thinking about holding an environmental summer camp for youth to come learn about climate change and the climate strike. We have done a one-day enviro school before, and it was a success.

If you could do one thing to take this fight to the next level, what would it be?

If I could convince the Canadian government to set high climate targets and actually meet them, my dream would have come true. I think for now, an easier thing to do is to get 1,000 climate strikers in Victoria.

The Big Picture: Tidal power

In seeking ways to generate electricity, jurisdictions around the world inevitably look at their natural endowments. For countries with especially choppy waters, that has included tidal power, which exploits the kinetic energy of changing tides. Here's a look at the biggest tidal power projects in the world.

(CBC)

What's on your mind?

Nicole Mortillaro's story last week on OOM, a Canadian company that has created a standalone, off-grid power unit for large buildings, stirred a lot of interest — both positive and negative.

One reader wrote in to say, ""I started to get a little concerned when I learned that it takes companies off the grid, which in Ontario largely provides energy from clean sources, and will be providing electricity from natural gas.""

Another reader had this suggestion: ""The country does not need OOM or anything else. What it needs is reliable electricity hidden underground!"" The idea of burying power lines has been bandied about for a while — with the acknowledgement that it is a very expensive undertaking.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

A new study suggests that the expansion of our urban environment is leading more animals to ingest ""human food,"" which is affecting their biology and behaviour. One example: Some bears are hibernating for shorter periods.

Canadian political watchers know that the popularity of the federal NDP has been flagging, notably in Quebec. This column suggests that in order to win back a large number of (environmentally minded) Quebecers, Jagmeet Singh's party should propose a Canadian version of the Green New Deal.

One big takeaway from this week: Government policies to reduce carbon emissions work. That was the finding of a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, which revealed that between 2005 and 2015, CO2 levels in 18 countries (including many European countries and the U.S. — but not Canada) declined.

In what seems like poetic environmental justice, a research team led by RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, has figured out a carbon capture process that sucks CO2 out of the air and turns it into … coal.



Styrofoam and the environment: It's complicated

(Emily Chung/CBC)

Amid all the recent talk of banning plastic, many environmentally conscious consumers wonder: What about Styrofoam?

Also known as plastic foam, the scientific term for it is expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), and it can be found in everything from takeout containers to helmets to car bumpers.

The worldwide production capacity of polystyrene in 2016 was 14.7 million tonnes, according to industry group Plastics Insight. It is estimated that 80 per cent of Canada's foam packaging ends up in the garbage, contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic annually discarded in oceans.

According to Science Learning Hub, it can take up to 500 years for one foam cup to break down.

Indianapolis-based plastic manufacturing expert Kelvin Okamato points out that there are two common versions of polystyrene: expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) and extruded polystyrene foam (XPS). EPS is used to create foam cups and takeout containers, whereas XPS is used to make packing material as well as insulation board for buildings.

The main reason polystyrene is so ubiquitous is that it is lightweight, rigid, versatile and able to withstand dramatic temperature changes. According to a 2016 study, 40 per cent of polystyrene is made for the food packaging industry — and EPS foam containers in the industry are at an all-time high.

Food Safety Magazine has noted that polystyrene foam trays are economically beneficial because they are cheap to produce and dispose of, and the fact that they're single-use helps with food safety.

While styrofoam has long seemed like an environmental villain, a recent European-based study found that manufacturing EPS containers has a lower environmental impact — minimal material and electricity requirements for manufacture — than two other common takeaway containers, which are made of aluminum and polypropylene.

Alberta-based manufacturing expert Odessa Ingarfield said the main problem is that polystyrene isn't manufactured to be recycled. In many places around the globe, polystyrene is difficult to recycle because its petroleum base is hard to break down, while the lightweight and clunky shape makes it expensive to transport.

So much of it gets thrown out.

""Designers now are asked to design a product, but not the recyclability of that product,"" said Ingarfield.

She believes that rather than banning EPS production, companies should be finding a way to repurpose it through a closed-loop recycling process, where waste is collected, processed and recycled back to its original material, or a two-stage processing facility.

Okamato and Ingarfield both believe changes to consumer behaviour will improve the environmental impact of polystyrene, and plastics more generally.

""If you want to use plastics, then make sure you know what you are using it for,"" said Ingarfield. ""If you plan on leaving [the item] behind to degrade, then don't use plastics.""

Before this month, most Canadians had never heard of Michael Wernick.

But when he stepped out of the shadows to defend the Trudeau government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case before the Commons justice committee, it was clear that he was a central player in the story.

As clerk of the privy council and secretary to the cabinet, he's Canada's most powerful bureaucrat.

Now, the leader of the Greens, Elizabeth May, is calling for his dismissal.

""Advice from my heart to my friends in the Liberal party,"" May said in Parliament. ""Do not dispute the truth of what our former minister of justice has said.

""Do not attempt to question or undermine or impugn her integrity. No one will believe them if they do.

""What they must do is tell the truth, let the chips fall where they may, starting with these three steps,"" May continued. ""Call for a public inquiry. Release the former minister of justice from restrictions in her evidence, and fire the clerk of the privy council office!""

That elicited a standing ovation by opposition MPs.

Video of Fallout continues from Jody Wilson-Raybould's explosive testimony | APTN News Watch Elizabeth May's comments, starting at 1:23 of this video.

On February 27, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony to the justice committee suggested that Wernick was somewhat less partisan than he had often been portrayed.

According to Wilson-Raybould, Wernick mentioned to her on September 17 in a meeting with the prime minister that there was about to be an election in Quebec. This came as Wernick made the case for a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin in which he also cited potential job losses if a court case proceeded.

Two days later, according to Wilson-Raybould, Wernick again brought up job losses but stated that the issue of granting a deferred prosecution agreement was not about the Quebec election or Trudeau being an MP from Montreal.

""I told the clerk again that I had instructed the deputy minister is not to get in touch with the director [of public prosecutions] and that given my review of the matter I would not speak to her directly regarding a DPA,"" Wilson-Raybould testified. ""I offered that if SNC were to send a letter to me expressing their concerns—their public interest argument—it would be permissible and I would appropriately forward it directly to the DPP.""

SNC-Lavalin never sent such a letter, according to Wilson-Raybould.

She also described a ""fairly lengthy call"" with Wernick on December 19. She claimed that Wernick told her that Trudeau was going to find a way to get a deferred prosecution agreement, one way or another.

""I told the clerk that I was 100 percent confident that I was doing nothing inappropriate. I, again, reiterated I am confident in where I am at on my views on SNC and the DPA have not changed—this is a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,"" she added.

""I warned the clerk that we were treading on dangerous ground here—and I issued a stern warning because as the AG, I cannot act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that.""

According to her, Wernick expressed concerns about a ""collision"" between her and the prime minister because he was ""pretty firm on this"" and that ""this is really important to him.""

In a question-and-answer session with MPs on the committee following her opening statement, Wilson-Raybould said that she interpreted Wernick's comments to have been made in a ""threatening manner"".

In earlier testimony, Wernick maintained that there is not two-tiered justice in Canada.

""Despite the most extensive government-relations effort in modern times, including meetings with officials, political staff, the opposition leaders, paid advertising, advocacy by two consecutive premiers of Quebec, the company did not get what it wanted—demonstrably, because they're seeking judicial review,"" Wernick said. ""Are we soft on corporate crime? No.""

Wernick also insisted to the committee that there was ""no inappropriate pressure"" put on Wilson-Raybould—a claim that she later rejected.

Two of Trudeau's more vocal defenders in the national media have been Jonathan Wilkinson and Carla Qualtrough, two Liberal cabinet ministers from Metro Vancouver.

Wilkinson, the fisheries and oceans minister and the MP for North Vancouver, appeared on CBC Radio's As It Happens program last night; Qualtrough, the public service minister and MP for Delta, appeared earlier this month on CTV's Question Period.

Both are first-term MPs who were promoted to cabinet by Trudeau after winning seats that had previously been held by the Conservatives.

REUTERS/Chris Wattie

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday shuffled his cabinet for the second time in six weeks in response to a crisis caused by the resignation of a minister who then alleged inappropriate conduct by officials.

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb. 12 after less than a month in the job.

Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau’s resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October.

Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture.

Liberal Richard Lee captured 26 per cent, Conservative Jay Shin 22.5 per cent and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson 10.6 per cent.","NDP leader Jagmeet Singh easily won the Burnaby South byelection Monday night, pushing aside, at least for now, doubts about his ability to lead the party into the fall federal election.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut’ Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.

But analysts told The Tyee the true test of Singh’s leadership would be whether he can define the party’s identity in an era of political extremes.

“Friends, you made history today,” Singh told friends, family and supporters in a ballroom in Burnaby’s Hilton Hotel. “When I was growing up, I could have never imagined someone like me running to be prime minister. Guess what, we just told a lot of kids out there that ‘yes you can.’”

In the crowd Singh’s parents beamed with pride while two young teenagers wiped tears from their eyes. Singh won with 39 per cent of the vote. Liberal Richard Lee captured 26 per cent, Conservative Jay Shin 22.5 per cent and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson 10.6 per cent. Voter turnout was about 30 per cent.

During a long, passionate and at times improvised victory speech, Singh shifted back and forth between his identity as the first Indo-Canadian leader of a major political party and an unabashedly left-wing critique of what’s wrong with the country.

“Conservatives and Liberals have rigged the system that works for the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected — not for everyday Canadians,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be this way, we can fix it and we will fix it.”

Singh led the polls all evening, to the delight of his enthusiastic supporters. When NDP MP Don Davies came on stage to announce initial election results he remarked, “there is tremendous energy and excitement in this room tonight.”

Such enthusiasm was not always easy to find during the lead-up to election night. Singh was criticized for his lacklustre performance during a national TV interview with CTV’s Evan Solomon. Some senior NDP members anonymously told CBC that if Singh lost, he’d likely have to resign as leader.

Davies said in an interview Monday night that the byelection victory is a turning point.

“It’s really the flipside of all that chatter about the doomsday scenarios,” Davies said. “I think he’s going to be a decisive winner tonight. I think it’ll put an end to doubts about his leadership and I think every metric will improve, from our polling numbers to our fundraising.”

That might be a tall order, as the NDP is polling below 15 per cent, trailing the Liberals and Conservatives who each have about 35-per-cent support, according to the non-partisan site CalculatedPolitics.

Yet University of Ottawa political theorist and commentator David Moscrop said these low poll numbers may not be as dire as they might seem.

“The NDP is hovering about where’d you’d expect them historically to hover in the polls,” he told The Tyee. “We have this expectation that they ought to be doing better, but that’s a historical anomaly. That’s in part a reflection of the fact that the NDP has done unusually well in recent years. Now they’ve come back down to Earth.”

To return the NDP to the more than 30-per-cent support it enjoyed in mid-2015, he’ll need to define a clear, unapologetic identity for the party, Moscrop said.

For inspiration, Singh could draw from the democratic socialist movements gaining popularity in the U.S. and U.K., he said.

“There’s a bit of a struggle internally, a philosophical struggle as well perhaps a political struggle, over whether [the NDP] ought to make that sharper left turn,” Moscrop said. “They need to decide whether they want to be Liberal-lite, which probably won’t serve them well, or whether they want to run a Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, Corbyn-style campaign.”

This tension isn’t new for the NDP, nor easily resolved.

“This is a perennial debate, this is just the most recent iteration of it,” Stewart Prest, a political scientist at Simon Fraser University, told The Tyee. “Is it a party of principle, which gives a voice to the strongest expression of values that its members can think of, or is it a party that seeks power and tries to make strategic compromises along the way?”

The byelection results offered a preview of another challenge Singh will face heading into the Oct. 21 election. The People’s Party of Canada, which has made open hostility to refugees a core part of its far-right populist platform, won almost about 11 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South.

Jagmeet Singh Lays It on the Line read more

During one campaign event I attended, Singh said he was “disgusted by some of the values being espoused” by the People’s Party of Canada’s Thompson, who had said more thorough screening of refugees was needed and pointed to the killing of Marrisa Shen as an example of the risks, failing to mention that many Syrian-Canadians have condemned the crime and pleaded for it not to be the basis for a wider refugee backlash.

Prest said Singh, as a highly visible face of Canada’s diversity, is in a good position to fight against politicians who attempt to gain power by stoking racial resentment.

But in doing so Singh could be forced to defend his own cultural background rather than the progressive economic and social policies he stands for — as he has been obliged to do ever since running for the NDP leadership.

“It seems like there may be both an advantage, but also a potential disadvantage for Singh having to play that role,” Prest said.

On Monday night, Singh was obviously enjoying his victory, dancing on stage, grinning and high-fiving supporters, while also reminding them about the long road ahead.

“I’m asking you all to keep this fight going for the next eight months, I need you to be a part of this,” he said as his speech came to a close. “The people at the top and the wealthiest corporations have it way too good for way too long.”",Jagmeet Singh’s Next Hurdle: Define His Party in an Era of Extremes,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/02/26/Singh-Next-Hurdle/

The gross domestic product (GDP) figure was lower than the 1.0 percent expected by analysts, following 2.0 percent growth in the previous quarter.

This slowing pace closed out the year with a total annualized economic growth rate of 1.8 percent, slightly more than half the previous year’s 3.0 percent and the United States’s 2.9 percent growth in 2018.

“The ‘R’ word (for recession) will be on minds as Canada’s economy barely skirted the start of a recession in Q4,” CIBC Capital Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in a research note.

He pointed to a “weak handoff” from December to the new year, that he said will likely prompt the Bank of Canada to back off plans to raise interest rates in the short term.

“If not for a huge employment gain in January (+67,000 jobs) we’d be worried about an outright recession, but at this point, its best described as a stalled engine,” Shenfeld concluded.

Either scenario is bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals as they head into elections in October looking to hold onto their parliamentary majority.

The Trudeau Liberals’ popularity slipped amid allegations by his former attorney general of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign.

For the first time, the ruling Liberal Party has found itself trailing the opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer in the most recent public opinion polls.

Statistics Canada said the nation’s slowing economic growth mainly reflected a drop in investment spending and lower exports.

Household spending slowed for a second consecutive quarter, with spending on life insurance and financial services up and on motor vehicles down.

Purchases of cannabis — after recreational use was legalized in October — totalled Can$5.9 billion (US$4.5 billion) or 0.5 percent of household spending.

Business investment on non-residential structures, and machinery and equipment fell sharply, but that plunge was moderated by an uptick in investment in intellectual property products.

The latter was “mainly attributable to mineral exploration and evaluation, which can be influenced by anticipated prices and potential new reserves,” said Statistics Canada.

Exports volumes edged down, led by lower exports of forestry products, building and packaging materials, metal and non-metallic minerals, and energy products.

62,World,2019-03-01T12:03:00.0000000Z,"On June 17, 2014, Trudeau, then the leader of the third-place federal Liberal Party, vowed to kill the ... and extremely rigorous process that set Canada apart as a country that did not resort ...","Many Canadians are expressing surprise that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears to have little regard for the rule of law in the wake of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive and credible testimony Wednesday before the Commons justice committee.

Clearly, they have not been paying attention.

Trudeau has indicated his contempt for the rule of law on numerous occasions, and that started long before he was elected prime minister in October 2015.

On June 17, 2014, Trudeau, then the leader of the third-place federal Liberal Party, vowed to kill the Northern Gateway pipeline if he became prime minister, even though the project had already been approved by the National Energy Board’s joint review panel in December 2013 and had just been passed in the House of Commons.

Not only had Calgary-based Enbridge jumped through literally hundreds of planning and regulatory hoops starting in 2002 — including meeting all 209 extra conditions placed upon it by the NEB — and spent more than $500 million with the project’s other proponents — Trudeau had no regard for a semi-judicial and extremely rigorous process that set Canada apart as a country that did not resort to arbitrary measures and political whim when it came to determining the viability of large infrastructure projects.

A lot of politicians promise many things during election campaigns — and are forced to break them once in power after they recognize that living up to their promise would be a disaster for the country. Jean Chretien was elected in 1993 on a promise to scrap the GST and tear up NAFTA. Thankfully for Canada, he did neither. Stephen Harper vowed that he would not get rid of income trusts. Once in power, when he better understood the implications to the economy, he broke that promise.

Many people thought Trudeau would break his reckless promise to kill the pipeline, just like he broke his promise to bring in a proportional representation electoral system and run a more transparent, different kind of government. Once opposition leaders become prime ministers they tend to get hit over the head with reality and what’s best for the country.

In June 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Conservative government’s approval of Northern Gateway, saying there was a lack of federal government consultation with First Nations in northern British Columbia.

In November 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that his government would not continue consultations with First Nations along the pipeline route as stipulated by the federal court, but it would scrap the project and approve Kinder Morgan’s twinning of the Trans Mountain pipeline (which the federal government has since purchased).

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley did not utter a peep of protest about the scrapping of Northern Gateway — a $7.9-billion project that would have moved 525,000 barrels of oil per day from near Edmonton to the port in Kitimat, B.C., creating thousands of jobs. Curtailment would have not been necessary since the price differential would not have occurred to such a severe extent. But I digress.

Tim McMillan, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said during an interview Thursday that “the cancellation of Northern Gateway was the most damaging thing that’s been done to our economy.

“Northern Gateway was an approved project,” added McMillan. “The federal court came back and said there’s one thing the federal government needs to do, ironically, it’s the same thing that needs to be done on the Trans Mountain project, to conduct better Aboriginal consultation, and the federal government then made the devastating decision just to cancel it. And that sent a very negative signal to global investors and has had the effect of killing thousands of jobs over time, costing our economy tens of billions of dollars.”

It was the arbitrariness of Trudeau’s actions that has frightened investors and many companies.

According to a recent C.D. Howe Institute report, $100 billion in planned spending on resource projects in Canada has disappeared and more losses are expected without substantial changes to the Trudeau government’s regulatory overhaul, Bill C-69.

Bill C-69 will make arbitrariness and political whim the law of the land. It will allow for a political decision at the end of an onerous, costly and lengthy process, simply at the whim of a government minister.

No company is reckless enough to spend $500 million and many years of effort only to have some politically motivated cabinet minister reject the science and data purely for political reasons.

Trudeau’s government also helped kill the Energy East pipeline by moving the regulatory goalposts on the project.

Last week, Devon Energy Corp. announced it’s planning to sell its oilsands assets.

On Wednesday, former Canadian justice minister and attorney general Wilson-Raybould laid out before a Commons justice committee, in devastating detail, the level of contempt that Trudeau, his office and other senior Liberal government officials have for the rule of law and due process.

Her gripping testimony revealed that time and again, the PM and 10 other senior members of his government cared little for the rule of law, applying enormous pressure on Wilson-Raybould to interfere with the independence of the director of public prosecutions to not proceed with a criminal trial against SNC-Lavalin but to enter into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, or remediation, in an effort to ensure that the Quebec-based engineering giant doesn’t leave the province.

“Various officials also urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which it was clearly improper for me to do,” Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee.

“We either have a system that is based on the rule of law, the independence of the prosecutorial functions and respect for those charged to use their discretion and powers in particular ways, or we do not,” she said.

Sorry to break it to you all, but under this federal government, we do not. Bill C-69 is the poster child of the Trudeau government’s lack of respect for due process. So why the surprise?

MP Murray Rankin, the party’s justice critic and one of its senior caucus ... in Ottawa that is going to give a lot of Canadians pause about the nature of the Liberal government, the government they thought was going to be a very different ...","OTTAWA — The federal NDP is losing another member of its team just days after Leader Jagmeet Singh finally won a seat in the House of Commons in a make-or-break byelection.

B.C. MP Murray Rankin, the party’s justice critic and one of its senior caucus members, announced Thursday that he won’t seek re-election this year. His decision brings to 12 the number of NDP MPs elected in 2015 who aren’t running again — more than a quarter of the caucus.

“After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice,” he told the National Post in an interview. “It’s been the most exciting and rewarding thing I’ve ever done, working as an MP … But in terms of my life, I think it’s time to let someone else take the reins and I think this is a good time to do it.”

Rankin said he “absolutely” supports Singh’s leadership, and said he hopes the party is on an “upward incline” since Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday with 39 per cent of the vote.

“We had, I think, a very significant turnaround in the NDP fortunes when the leader won so convincingly in Burnaby South,” he said. “I think a lot of Canadians are now going to say we have a leader … who connects well with voters. We just have to get him into the House and get him better known by Canadians.”

After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice

Rankin, a lawyer who previously worked as a treaty negotiator for the province of B.C., was elected as the MP for Victoria in a 2012 byelection. He is the party’s justice critic and co-chair of the House of Commons justice committee, which is currently investigating allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deal with engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Rankin suggested the SNC-Lavalin controversy presents an opportunity for the NDP. “We have a situation unfolding in Ottawa that is going to give a lot of Canadians pause about the nature of the Liberal government, the government they thought was going to be a very different government,” he said.

In 2017, Rankin was also named to the national security committee of parliamentarians, tasked with overseeing Canada’s security and intelligence agencies.

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have decided not to seek another term. Of the 44 MPs elected in 2015, 12 have now announced they won’t run again, including Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Alberta’s lone NDP MP, Linda Duncan. A few more caucus members have yet to make their decisions public, including senior B.C. MP Nathan Cullen.

Singh has faced major hurdles since he won the party leadership in October 2017, including poor fundraising numbers and disappointing byelection results. Initially claiming he was comfortable without a seat in the House of Commons, he eventually changed his mind and decided to run in Burnaby. But his victory there was tempered by the loss of the Montreal riding of Outremont in a separate byelection on the same day, a seat held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007.

Rankin said it can be a “hard slog” for opposition MPs trying to make an impact in Ottawa. “The lot of an opposition politician isn’t always a happy one,” he said. “We do make differences … but sometimes being in an opposition role is not always gratifying.”

Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative to help guide talks in a new reconciliation process with the hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en nation, whose opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline through their traditional territory led to a showdown with the RCMP in January. He has accepted the position without pay.

“I simply want to do other things after this amount of time,” he said. “I think a lot of people would realize that going back and forth to Ottawa regularly, nine hours door-to-door, isn’t the most joyful experience, and maybe I can do other things at this stage of my career.”

United States President Donald Trump’s position is simply this: when Canada removes tariffs on U.S. dairy products, then we can talk about ...","Recent news coverage indicates we only need three words to describe our prime minister. And they would be Quebec, Quebec and Quebec!

He is clearly acting like the prime minister of Quebec rather than being the prime minister of Canada. It is blatantly obvious he is pandering for Quebec votes for the upcoming October federal election, hoping that will ensure a return to power for his party. This is a man that is clearly not acting in the best interests of Canada, but acting more in his own self-interest of political preservation. What he appears to be overlooking is that most Canadians are watching his love affair with his home province at the expense of the rest of the country and getting pretty tired of it all.

We only need to look back at just a few examples over the last 18 months to see how this is unfolding. First, a federal loan of $400 million to bail out struggling Montreal-based aviation manufacturer Bombardier to protect Quebec jobs. The company is family controlled, poorly managed and it is never wise to throw good Canadian taxpayer money after bad.

After all, isn’t $13 billion in federal equalization payments enough for Quebec?

Then, the Trudeau government stands firm during NAFTA negotiations to protect the uncompetitive Quebec dairy supply management system at the expense of continuing tariffs on steel/aluminum and sky-high dairy prices for all other Canadians. Then, he sides with Quebec to block the Energy East pipeline project to Atlantic Canada — a project that could have helped lift the entire region out of its economic depression by stimulating jobs and population growth.

Most recently, we have the prime minister allegedly illegally influencing engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin’s going to court over corruption and fraud charges. The prime minister fears jobs will be lost in Quebec if the company is found guilty of bribery and therefore banned by legislation from bidding on infrastructure projects in Canada. A guilty verdict would be bad news for 3,500 SNC jobs in Quebec and would dampen Liberal chances to win votes in the October federal election. SNC is significant financial contributor to the federal Liberal party and are already banned from bidding on international infrastructure projects funded by the World Bank due to bribery crimes in Third World countries.

“Inflated dairy prices are regressive and hurt poor and fixed income families the most.” — Adrian White, Business Matters

Let’s just take one of the above issues and expand on the unfairness of the Prime Minister’s actions to the rest of the country when he favours one region over another instead of doing what is best for the entire country. A good example is the 50-year-old supply management deal that favours Quebec dairy farmers and producers over all other Canadian consumers. Supply management is a federal government-controlled system whereby tariffs (also known as taxes) are put on imported dairy products (mainly from the United States) to make them as expensive as Canadian dairy goods. In the case of dairy, eggs and poultry the tariffs range in the 300 per cent level. In the supply management debate the federal government is using “alternative facts” to support their case for continued tariffs on imported dairy products.

During recent NAFTA negotiations, the Canadian government sacrificed our future by giving in to double-digit tariffs on steel and aluminum exported to the United States in return for keeping 300 per cent tariffs on dairy products to protect Quebec dairy profits.

United States President Donald Trump’s position is simply this: when Canada removes tariffs on U.S. dairy products, then we can talk about removing aluminum and steel tariffs on Canada. Steel and aluminum tariffs are hurting multiple sectors of the Canadian economy across the country including steel and aluminum producers, auto manufacturers, beer can manufacturers and every other sector that uses these products in their production lines.

To get a better picture of the political strength of the Canadian dairy industry, let’s look at their relationship with the federal government. While dairy farmers represent just six per cent of all farmers in Canada, the industry spends $100 million per year lobbying and marketing government politicians to ensure supply management is protected. To witness the power of this lobby you need not look any further than Nova Scotia. Have you ever wondered why plastic milk jugs and cartons are not included in the beverage container deposit refund system for the province? The reason is a powerful dairy lobby of the province back in 1996 that allowed them to be exempt.

Dairy producers will tell you they don’t get any direct subsidies from government. That is true. But all Canadian families with children subsidize the domestic dairy industry by being forced to pay nearly $600 more per year each for dairy products due to inflated prices. Inflated dairy prices are regressive and hurt poor and fixed income families the most. Canadian government tariffs (taxes) on dairy imports ensure you don’t get access to cheaper dairy products across the border in the United States. That is why so many Canadians living on the southern border drive across daily to purchase eggs and milk. That is why a rotisserie chicken is $10.99 in a Canadian grocery store but only $4.99 in a U.S. grocery store. According to Statistics Canada, the net worth of a Canadian dairy producer is near $5 million each. That is an astonishing fact! Canadian consumer subsidies for dairy producers are seven times those of U.S. dairy producers. All of this is at the expense of ordinary Canadians forced to pay inflated dairy prices.

There are no government subsidies or protective tariffs for Canadian beef or pork farmers, fish farms, blueberry harvesters, vegetable farmers, apple growers, Christmas tree harvesters or many other farmers that compete globally with producers of similar products around the world.

So, my point is this: supply management protection for dairy farmers harms all Canadians. However, our federal government is more interested in garnering votes in Quebec than doing what is right for the entire nation and therefore refuses to correct this injustice. Justin Trudeau is truly acting as the prime minister of Quebec and it appears the welfare of other regions of the country is not registering on his radar.

We are on our own in Atlantic Canada. So much for “sunny ways.”

Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This bye-election win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the New Democratic Party shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the party’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the National Democratic Party persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the bye-election, the National Democratic Party would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the party in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, New Democratic Party fundraising – already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election – continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the New Democratic Party out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this bye-election win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the bye-election was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the party announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the New Democratic Party. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the New Democratic Party can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the New Democratic Party in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the New Democratic Party to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilised members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this bye-election win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

In what The Guardian described as a “searing testimony” to a committee in Canada’s House of Commons, Jody Wilson-Raybould described a “consistent, sustained and inappropriate effort” by senior officials close to Trudeau to dissuade her from prosecuting Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin over accusations of fraud and bribery.

The former minister of justice and attorney general said the alleged pressure campaign included “veiled threats” by the officials, who feared the company might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

Wilson-Raybould claimed that the head of the federal civil service told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

However, under questioning from legislators from the ruling Liberal Party, the former minister said did not feel the pressure exercised on her had crossed the line into illegality.

Earlier this month, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that aides close to the PM had lobbied Wilson-Raybould to pursue a “deferred prosecution agreement” against SNC-Lavalin that would allow the company to escape with a fine. This allegation “forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts”, reports Reuters.

Wilson-Raybould was demoted unexpectedly in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She told the committee that she believes the SNC-Lavalin case prompted her demotion.

Following the hearing, Canadian opposition leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to resign.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” said the Conservative Party leader. “And that is why I am calling on Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.”

But Trudeau told a press conference in Quebec on Wednesday that he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of events.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” he said, adding that Canadians would have their say on his administration in the upcoming federal election, in October.

Crisis

The scandal “has become the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s administration”, says The Guardian.

SNC-Lavalin, one of the world’s largest engineering and construction companies, is facing fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m “in bribes it is alleged to have offfered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011”, reports the BBC.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will “vigorously defend itself” against the allegations.

The row has raised questions about whether the Trudeau government behaved in a way “that was ethically or legally problematic”, says The Globe and Mail. Canadians “have a right to answers” and “if they don’t like them, things could turn out very badly for the Trudeau government”, the newspaper adds.

The Choices

But Hamish Telford, a political science professor at British Columbia’s University of the Fraser Valley, told Vancouver-based site CityNews that despite Wilson-Raybould’s seemingly damning testimony, Trudeau is likely to continue as usual and wait for the election.

“Maybe Justin Trudeau feels fairly confident that once people are making the choice between him and Andrew Scheer and [New Democratic Party candidate] Jagmeet Singh, that we’ll choose him,” Telford said.",MEDIAWATCH:Canada PM rejects resignation call,Newsroom Panama,https://www.newsroompanama.com/media-watch/mediawatchcanada-pm-rejects-resignation-call

“I had another monologue fully prepared for today, but this late-breaking news is too important,” he advised his audience before running her full 30-minute opening statement, in its entirety, on his nightly Youtube show.

“I’m just going to play it to you in full, stopping from time to time to give my thoughts,” he promised.

“It’s the most amazing thing I think I’ve ever seen in Canadian politics.”

His takeaway: The former justice minister “told the truth about Justin Trudeau” — and now, Levant says, “I think he’s going to jail.”

The still unfolding SNC-Lavalin saga also inspired the Rebel crew to update an iconic image that first appeared in the now defunct Western Standard: The infamous “Libranos” poster, “a satirical image of Liberal ministers of the Chretien era who corrupted politics.”

A decade and a half later, “the Libranos are back, with a new generation of corruption under Justin Trudeau,” and to mark the occasion, the Rebel is now offering a selection of items emblazoned with an updated version of the original picture.

“Trudeau and his team are as corrupt as ever,” the Rebel pitch notes.

“Show your defiance of this corrupt political culture by proudly displaying a gorgeous Libranos poster — or even wear it as a T-shirt or get it on a coffee mug!”

And while it hasn’t yet inspired a swag collection, Levant is also keeping a close eye on a new twist on the Alberta pre-election policy front — namely, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney’s “bizarre” plan to “bring approximately 10,000 newcomers in total to rural Alberta every year,” a proposal that Levant finds inexplicable.

“If you were to knock on 1,000 doors in Alberta and ask, ‘What is a key issue in this provincial election,’ I doubt a single person would say: ‘We need more immigration.'” he notes.

Not only is it a “federal matter,” but there’s already “massive unemployment in Alberta … worse than any other province other than the Atlantic,” he notes.

“Alberta’s unemployed people are the most skilled unemployed people in Canada. They’re out of work because of Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau. There is no shortage of workers. There is a shortage of jobs. So Jason Kenney wants to bring in more workers? Before our existing Canadian unemployed are hired?”

Kenney’s gambit “is a solution in search of a problem. It doesn’t make sense.”

This, he says, “is Jason Kenney trying to win the love of the CBC, trying to prove how woke he is.”

And he’s once again leading the charge to support former U.K. Rebel reporter Tommy Robinson after he was permanently banned from both Facebook and Instagram due to concerns over potential hate speech — “an act of outrageous political censorship,” in Levant’s view.

“Depending on how you measure, Tommy was either the most popular Facebook page in the U.K. or the third most popular, after Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn,” he notes.

“In terms of viewer engagement, it was huge. He really was a one-man news network, the alternative to everyone and everything in the UK media party. And Facebook simply deleted it.”

Also making headlines in the Rebelverse this week:

While acknowledging the death of seven Halifax children who came to Canada as refugees from Syria in 2017 as a “gut-wrenching tragedy,” Toronto mission specialist David Menzies wonders whether Trudeau “would have attended a vigil for a fire that had taken the lives of non-refugees,” and points out that the prime minister was a no-show at the vigil for Burnaby, B.C. 13-year-old Marissa Shen, who was “allegedly murdered by a Syrian refugee.”

wonders whether Trudeau “would have attended a vigil for a fire that had taken the lives of non-refugees,” and points out that the prime minister was a no-show at the vigil for Burnaby, B.C. 13-year-old Marissa Shen, who was “allegedly murdered by a Syrian refugee.” Alberta correspondent Sheila Gunn Reid finds the apparent lack of records on the vetting of Syrian refugees — or, at least, the official response to her access to information request for such documents — to be “chilling.”

On the centre-left side of the Canadian political mediaverse, meanwhile, Rabble political writer Karl Nerenberg parses the numbers from the latest round of byelections, and —like just about everyone else to wade into the results — finds “good and bad news for all parties,” but on balance, he thinks the New Democrats have the most to celebrate.

“Pundits predicted Burnaby South would be a close race; the NDP won by fewer than 600 votes in 2015. This time, however, Jagmeet Singh had a 2,900 vote margin — although, in proportionate terms, Singh’s vote only slightly exceeded the combined Green and NDP vote of last time,” he notes.

“Some recent polls had the NDP in single digits in Quebec, while showing new life for the previously moribund Bloc Québécois. In that light, the 26 per cent second-place finish in Outremont for NDP candidate Julia Sanchez does not look half bad.”

He also believes that the surprisingly strong showing by Maxime Bernier’s fledgling People’s Party in Burnaby South “will unsettle Conservatives, and probably push the official opposition party further to the right.”

Meanwhile, Rabble “activist-blogger” Brent Patterson details the “highly successful” counter-protest to the United We Roll truck convoy that descended on the capital last week to protest everything from the federal carbon tax to the UN global contract on migration.

The rally, which was organized by Indigenous Solidarity Ottawa and Ottawa Against Fascism, brought “150 to 200 people” to the Hill, and “created a temporary space in front of Parliament Hill that challenged the alt-right and the violence of the fossil fuel economy,” he notes.

“In doing so, it notably engaged in the real prefigurative politics of bringing grassroots movements together,” which, he concludes, “was a good example of what we must continue to build.”

The United We Roll protest — and the overall political mood in Alberta on the eve of an election — prompted Ricochet writer Aaron Saad to wonder if his home province is “trapped in an abusive relationship with its fossil fuel industry.”

“Having grown up there, I can’t help but find the plight behind these efforts especially heartbreaking,” he acknowledges.

“But there’s also something frustrating about seeing so much hope and effort dedicated to reviving that industry.”

Finally, Press Progress turns the spotlight on the Canadian Consumer Rewards Coalition, a new “grassroots” — quotation marks theirs, not ours — group that “stands up for big banks and credit card companies” by making the case for why “getting nickel-and-dimed” by bank and credit card fees “is actually a good thing.”

“The coalition — established last year with support from corporate lawyers, lobbyists, downtown Toronto public relations experts and the banking community – wants everyone in Canada to know that moves to regulate bank and credit card fees could lead big banks and credit card companies to punish their customers,” PP reports.

To get the message out, they’ve “been busy on Facebook, posting videos and running sponsored ads, warning consumers that any move to cap bank and credit card fees could cause profitable corporations to retaliate by taking away your consumer reward points.”

TORONTO (AP) — Cabinet ministers rallied around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday, a day after his former attorney general testified that he inappropriately tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company in order to save jobs — a case that has shaken the government in an election year.

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that ""the prime minister would never apply improper pressure"" and expressed ""100 percent faith"" in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was ""entirely appropriate"" for his staff to talk with the justice minister's staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""That's exactly what we have done every step of the way.

""We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,"" he added. ""There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had ""approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn't think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould's testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau's office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament's justice committee to testify.

""I believe my evidence will be of assistance,"" Butts said in a statement.

Wilson-Raybould, who had already been demoted to veterans' affairs minister in January, resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12. She remains a member of Trudeau's Liberal party in Parliament.","Canada PM Trudeau, ministers deny improper pressure in case",seattlepi.com,https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Trudeau-ministers-deny-improper-pressure-13652778.php
70,Business,2019-02-28T23:11:00.0000000Z,"There was little fluctuation across party lines, with very similar proportions of Canadians who voted Conservative (30%), Liberal (28%) and New Democratic (26%) in the 2015 federal election saying Canada should buy Montana. The biggest variation is ...","We have all been exposed to online petitions in the past few years, but one that caught the eye of the media on both sides of the 49th parallel this month was unique. Someone identified as Ian Hammond is suggesting that the state of Montana should be sold to Canada for US$1 trillion.

The petition alleges that the money that Canada would pay for what is colloquially known as Big Sky Country would be used to eliminate America’s national debt. While US$1 trillion is a considerable amount of money, the United States would be required to sell 21 more states at the same price to actually erase its national debt, calculated late last year a US$21.97 trillion.

In any case, the idea has provided plenty of fodder for the media. At the time of this writing, more than 16,000 people have added their names to the petition. Research Co. asked Canadians about it last week. Across the country, a majority of respondents (56%) disagreed with the notion of purchasing Montana, but almost three in 10 (28%) were ready to welcome an American state into Confederation.

Canadian men are more likely to support the purchase than women (32% to 24% respectively). On a regional basis, residents of Alberta boasted the highest level of support for a “Canadian Montana” at 37%, followed closely by Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 34%.

There was little fluctuation across party lines, with very similar proportions of Canadians who voted Conservative (30%), Liberal (28%) and New Democratic (26%) in the 2015 federal election saying Canada should buy Montana.

The biggest variation is observed on age. Just 21% of Canadians aged 55 and over and 28% of those aged 35-to-54 would consent to the Montana purchase. But the proportion jumps dramatically among those aged 18 to 34 to 41%.

Montana borders three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Its main economic activities are agriculture and ranching, which may suggest a perfect extension of Alberta into the south. However, Montana is landlocked, so its acquisition would not facilitate the process of getting Alberta’s oil to Asian markets, unless a pipeline somehow turned westward into Idaho and Oregon.

In some respects, Canada would be adding a distinctly multicultural province. Montana’s state motto, “Oro y Plata,” (“Silver and Gold”) is the only one in the entire United States to be penned in Spanish, instead of the most habitual Latin or English. The motto also enshrines the importance of mining, at a time when resource development projects have become more controversial than ever in Western Canada.

Montana’s state animal is the grizzly bear, the same species that was recently protected by the British Columbia government in the form of an extremely popular ban on trophy hunting. If Montana became a province, Canada would get a piece of the coveted Yellowstone National Park, as well as the second-largest ski resort in the United States – Big Sky.

There are also implications in the world of sport. Welcoming Montana into Confederation might help bring about tax incentives to refurbish the Centennial Ice Arena in Billings, in the hopes of bringing an eighth National Hockey League (NHL) team to Canada. Montana’s residents pay no sales tax, but that would change after the purchase. This should prompt the ownership group to christen the NHL franchise as the “GST Billings.”

The population of Montana is similar to those of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so both should serve as starting points to figure out how to establish a legislature for the newest Canadian province. Saskatchewan’s legislative assembly has 61 seats, and Manitoba’s has 57. Let’s split the difference and award Montana a legislature with 59 members.

At this time, Montana has 100 members in the state House of Representatives and 50 in the state Senate. A process of primaries would reduce those 150 state lawmakers to 59, and a test would transfer existing Democrats and Republicans into Canada’s more traditional political parties.

Montana’s three representatives in the U.S. Congress – two senators and one congressman—would be immediately appointed to the Canadian Senate. If we allocate Montana the same six seats that other western provinces have in the Red Chamber, that leaves us with three vacancies.

Let’s take two nominees from the realm of entertainment. Missoula-born filmmaker David Lynch and actor Dana Carvey would be wonderful additions to the upper house. We could even find a way for Mike Myers to preside their citizenship ceremony.

The final Senate nominee from Montana is Phil Jackson, who coached teams to 11 National Basketball Association titles. We not only gain a capable negotiator, but an ideal option to coach Canada’s basketball team in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.

Unfortunately, Canadians rejected the purchase by a two-to-one margin. But we still can ponder what could be.",Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana,Vancouver Is Awesome,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/28/canadians-dont-want-1trillion-purchase-montana-us-state/

The finance minister has the final say on rules proposed by Canada’s largest capital markets watchdog, and industry watchers said the ...","A pair of new commissioners with connections to Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party have been appointed to Ontario’s top securities watchdog, a move that may raise eyebrows after a public disagreement last fall hinted at strained relations between the regulator and the province.

Mary Anne De Monte-Whelan and Heather Zordel, both highly-qualified corporate finance professionals, were added to the roster of the Ontario Securities Commission on Wednesday, following a four-month period which saw eight commissioners depart after their appointments were not renewed.

De Monte-Whelan is a former investment banker who was also an adjunct lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, and is now president of The Delan Group, a consulting firm.

Zordel is a partner in the securities group at mid-sized law firm Gardiner Roberts LLP. She also sits on the board of Toronto Hydro and is serving a three-year term as a part-time member of the Condominium Authority of Ontario, which operates under the province’s Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Both also have ties to the Progressive Conservative Party.

De Monte-Whelan ran as a Conservative candidate in 2011, losing the race in the Etobicoke-Centre riding.

A 2011 campaign-period financial statement for “Mary Anne Demonte-Whelan,” which the Post received from Elections Ontario on Wednesday, showed a $1,217.15 contribution from Deco Adhesives Products (1985) Ltd., the Ford family business.

Zordel, meanwhile, has since 2014 contributed to the provincial Conservative party and several of its members, including Doug Ford’s run for the leadership of the party in 2018, according to the Elections Ontario website.

Ford was elected Premier of Ontario last June and, within months, there were signs the OSC and the new government were not entirely aligned on policy.

In September, Finance Minister Vic Fedeli issued a terse statement saying the Ford government disagreed with a freshly issued OSC proposal to scrap some commissions tied to mutual fund sales.

The finance minister has the final say on rules proposed by Canada’s largest capital markets watchdog, and industry watchers said the surprising public rebuke was likely to put a chill on the regulatory process.

The OSC fee proposal, which came from a process initiated by the former Liberal government in Ontario, was backed by 12 other provincial and territorial securities regulators under the umbrella of the Canadian Securities Administrators.

In a statement Wednesday, OSC chair Maureen Jensen praised the “tremendous breadth of financial experience and strong industry perspectives” the new appointees would bring to the commission.

“I am delighted with the appointments of Mary Anne and Heather,” she said. “I look forward to working closely with them to deliver regulation that drives opportunities for Ontario businesses and investors.”

OSC commissioners are appointed for fixed terms by Ontario’s Lieutenant Governor in Council.

A spokesperson for Ontario’s finance ministry said Zordel and De Monte-Whelan were appointed for the “extensive expertise” they will bring to the commission.

“Both appointees applied and were reviewed by the Ontario Securities Commission’s Governance and Nominating Committee,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Further, both Ms. De Monte-Whelan and Ms. Zordel were approved through the all-party Standing Committee on Government Agencies.”

The OSC had just seven commissioners before Wednesday’s appointments, dropping from 15 last fall as the terms of eight commissions expired without renewal or replacements.

The regulator, which enforces securities laws and also sets policy for the province’s capital markets, cannot run with fewer than nine commissioners for longer than 90 days. The terms of two current commissioners are set to expire this summer.

Ford has faced questions over recent appointments of family friends and close associates linked the PC party.

The appointment of Ron Taverner as chief of the Ontario Provincial Police has prompted a review by the province’s Integrity Commissioner after a report Taverner didn’t meet the initial posted job requirements for rank, but was hired after the requirements were changed.

The premier has also been criticized by Liberal and NDP opponents for the appointment of Cameron Montgomery, a defeated Progressive Conservative candidate last June, to a $140,000 a year job as chair of an agency that administers standardized provincial testing for students.

Ford and his government have not been shy about shaking things up since they were elected to power. In a surprise move, they slashed the size of Toronto city council, and Ford made good on an election pledge to end the tenure of the chief executive of Hydro One, whose compensation prompted Ford to publicly refer to him as the Six Million Dollar Man.",Two new commissioners with Progressive Conservative ties appointed to Ontario's market watchdog,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/fp-street/two-new-commissioners-with-progressive-conservative-ties-appointed-to-ontarios-market-watchdog/wcm/636d0eb3-fc72-4aa8-a15e-3061c30b60b0

This episode features Lisa Raitt, Conservative MP and the party’s deputy leader, duelling it out with Wayne Easter, Liberal MP and chair of the finance committee. The pair have known each other for a number of years through their work in government. “I sat literally as close as you could to him on the opposite side ... I like to poke at him, I like to push his buttons a little bit,” Raitt said. And they seem to share similar sentiments about one another.

In Raitt’s words, “I wouldn’t say quick to anger, but he’s fiery.” During their dates, the opposing MPs debate how money is spent under the Liberal Government and if the taxes in place are actually benefiting the people — in particular, small business owners. In the 2017 budget, the Liberals said they were closing tax loopholes abused by small business owners. However, Conservatives argue that it’s gone too far. Easter believes the government has a responsibility to take care of people’s needs by providing services, as well as investing in what’s best for the country in the long term.

He lives on a six-generation farm in Malpeque, P.E.I. that was almost destroyed by a major fire years ago. He said within days, 60 people had gathered to help them rebuild. “It gives you an understanding of how important it is to help others. People were there for me, so I should be there for them,” he said.

Raitt disagrees, saying the public should decide how their money is spent and the government has no place digging into their pockets.

Have your say:

“What it goes back to fundamentally is big government isn’t good government. And the government shouldn’t be involved in every aspect of your life,” she said. For Easter’s date, he takes Raitt to visit the Thompson Potato Company in Malpeque to showcase how the small business has flourished with the help of a government agency. With $350,000 borrowed from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, the company can now supply potatoes year-round. They have also been able to streamline operations by purchasing a high-tech potato grader with built-in cameras. But Raitt pushes back, saying it hasn’t helped the economy grow because the company invested in automation, squashing the potential of creating new jobs.

Wayne Easter, Liberal MP and Chair of the Finance Committee, debates with his date, Lisa Raitt, Conservative MP and Deputy Leader of the Official Opposition, about deficits and the ratio of debt to GDP.

For Raitt’s turn, she takes Easter on a date in Milton, Ont. to meet one of her constituents whose local business is affected by the government’s heavy taxation. They speak with café owner Troy Newton who questions some of the expensive purchases made under the Liberal Government. Namely the infamous giant rubber duck that was erected on Toronto’s waterfront in celebration of Canada’s 150th anniversary, costing the government $120,000. As well as, a $5.6 million skating rink built on Parliament Hill, also part of the 150 celebrations. “You really think you want to help the country and save the tax? Stop spending money on ice rinks that don’t get used and rubber duckies,” Newton said. “Will I be able to be alive to see when we balance the budget?” he asked.

By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major company avoid a corruption trial.

The remarks by Jody Wilson-Raybould, made during almost four hours of sometimes dramatic testimony to the House of Commons justice committee, deepened the worst crisis of Trudeau's tenure months before an October election.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

""I therefore completely disagree with (Wilson-Raybould's) characterization of events,"" he added, brushing off a demand from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer that he step down.

The case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she said, adding that some officials had made veiled threats unless she cooperated.

The head of the federal civil service, she said, told her that Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.""

Wilson-Raybould said those exchanges prompted her to think of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when the U.S. attorney general and his top deputy quit rather than obey an order from President Richard Nixon to fire an investigator probing the Watergate scandal.

She added, however, under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

'NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION'

SNC-Lavalin was seeking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it. A trial is pending for the company.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Wilson-Raybould said officials cited the danger that the firm might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

She cited several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau as among those weighing in. A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould said that during a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau, he asked her ""to find a solution"" for SNC-Lavalin.

""I asked: 'Are you politically interfering with my role? ... I would strongly advise against it.' The prime minister said: 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.'""

Trudeau told the news conference that ""our government will always focus on jobs"" and said officials had discussed the implications of SNC-Lavalin cutting its workforce.

Wilson-Raybould said that in mid-December, her chief of staff expressed concerns about possible political interference during a chat with Butts.

Citing her chief of staff's account of the exchange, Wilson-Raybould quoted Butts as saying: ""There is no solution here that does not involve some interference.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday shuffled his cabinet for the second time in six weeks in response to a crisis caused by the resignation of a minister who then alleged inappropriate conduct by officials.

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb. 12 after less than a month in the job.

Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau’s resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October.

Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture.

The deposed Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was hardly exposed to a court-style cross this week, but make no mistake: She’s come a hell of a lot closer to it than any of the other sorry players in the SNC-Lavalin imbroglio. She emerged whole, and her evidence had the wonderful and unmistakable ring of truth.

At the Justice Committee Wednesday, she was cogent and detailed, with names and dates and some contemporaneously made notes and/or emails and texts to help her already-clear memory. She was thoughtful and responsive to the questions.

Then look at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger and all the other Liberal MPs who nod like those bobble-heads you see in the back windows of cars — and with approximately the same intelligence.

Since this scandal broke, the PM has been completely unresponsive to Opposition questions in Question Period (when he has deigned to appear), reciting instead the pap he has force-fed Chagger et al about “always standing up for jobs” while simultaneously “respecting Canadian institutions.”

Even Morneau was reduced to saying this Thursday, before he bolted from a group of reporters.

Among them, the Liberals have said this probably 100 times and I still don’t understand how the Speaker lets them get away with it or what it means — except that what they mean are SNC-Lavalin jobs.

One of the tiny, telling details from Wilson-Raybould’s evidence was how, when making the case for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for SNC-Lavalin, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick brought up the fact that the company had “a board meeting on Thursday with stockholders.”

(This was at a meeting Wilson-Raybould had Sept. 17, 2018 with Wernick and Trudeau, at a point when Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel had already decided not to offer a DPA, and Wilson-Raybould had decided it was not appropriate for her to intervene.)

Even if one accepts that it was A-OK for Trudeau and his minions to badger Wilson-Raybould into changing her mind – and she didn’t, and told the pair of them they were out of line, as indeed they were — why on Earth was Wernick so acutely aware of SNC’s business timelines?

He did it again two days later, at a second meeting Trudeau insisted Wilson-Raybould have with Wernick, mentioning again the upcoming SNC meeting, telling her that its lawyer, Frank Iacobucci (a former Supreme Court judge), was “no shrinking violet” and that he, Wernick, understood SNC was “going back and forth with” Roussel.

Why all this effort on behalf of SNC?

Well, the benign explanation is that DPAs are meant to spare innocent parties – workers, shareholders, pensioners – from paying the price for the corporate malfeasance of a few. Like plea bargains for individuals, DPAs are pragmatic tools for prosecutors.

And SNC-Lavalin, under its current CEO Neil Bruce and previous CEO Robert Card, has made much of how they have changed the corporate culture at the company, brought in a big broom and fired anyone remotely associated with bad behaviour and developed a whole ethical regime.

Why on Earth was Michael Wernick so acutely aware of SNC’s business timelines?

This is all to the good, if so.

But consider the company’s very checkered past, not all of it so long ago.

In 2016, on the heels of the Charbonneau inquiry into the construction industry in Quebec, SNC-Lavalin entered into a “voluntary reimbursement program” with the Quebec government.

According to Justice Quebec, this was a two-year program “to ensure mainly the recovery of amounts improperly paid as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics in connection with public contracts.” After paying back the monies owed, “participants could obtain a discharge that protected them from civil proceedings for fraud or fraudulent tactics” in connection with getting a public contract.

In October 2015, SNC-Lavalin reached a settlement with the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) “regarding allegations of sanctionable practices” by a subsidiary of the company in connection with two AfDB-financed projects, one in Uganda, the other in Mozambique.

According to the AfDB press release, the agreement “resolves allegations uncontested by the company of illicit payments ordered by former SNC International Inc. employees to public officials in order to secure contracts.”

Under the terms of the agreement, AfDB imposed “a conditional non-debarment (debarring prevents a company getting public contracts) … for a period of two years and 10 months” and repayment of $1.5 million.

The projects dated to October 2008 and December 2010.

More recently, in September 2016, SNC-Lavalin entered into a “compliance agreement” with the Commissioner of Elections Canada for illegal contributions made to federal political entities between March 9, 2004 and May 1, 2011.

According to the agreement on the Commissioner’s website, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. reimbursed $117,803.49 for illegal contributions, almost all of which had gone to the Liberal Party of Canada, various Liberal riding associations and contestants in the Liberal Party’s 2006 leadership race. The rest, $8,200, was tossed the way of the Conservative Party. (The company was reimbursing employees for contributions it had wanted them to make.)

And, of course, there’s the World Bank debarment of SNC-Lavalin, and 100 affiliates, for a period of 10 years.

That happened in April 2013, and, according to the World Bank press release, it was related to the company’s “misconduct in relation to the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in Bangladesh,” as well as unspecified misconduct in relation to another World Bank-financed Rural Electrification and Transmission project in Cambodia.

None of that much mattered when it came to giving SNC-Lavalin a pass.

In December 2015, less than two months after the Liberals came to power, SNC signed an “administrative agreement” with the federal government, allowing it to bid and win work despite the criminal charges still pending.

These fraud and bribery charges date back to 2000-2011, for its alleged $48-million worth of bribery in Libya, which are now in different ways before two Canadian courts.

As of Thursday, according to the Public Services and Procurement website, SNC-Lavalin is the only supplier in the country with such an agreement.

Just how stupid do the Liberals think Canadians are?

76,,2019-03-01T13:25:00.0000000Z,"(Government of Canada video still) “I had another monologue fully ... eye on a new twist on the Alberta pre-election policy front — namely, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney’s “bizarre” plan to “bring approximately 10,000 newcomers ...","It’s rare that Canadian federal politics offers up a made-for-TV spectacular so riveting that even Rebel Media commander Ezra Levant has no need to edit, recut, splice, dice and remix it to fit his signature narrative style, but former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s appearance before the House justice committee on Thursday managed to meet that heretofore purely theoretical threshold.

“I had another monologue fully prepared for today, but this late-breaking news is too important,” he advised his audience before running her full 30-minute opening statement, in its entirety, on his nightly Youtube show.

“I’m just going to play it to you in full, stopping from time to time to give my thoughts,” he promised.

“It’s the most amazing thing I think I’ve ever seen in Canadian politics.”

His takeaway: The former justice minister “told the truth about Justin Trudeau” — and now, Levant says, “I think he’s going to jail.”

The still unfolding SNC-Lavalin saga also inspired the Rebel crew to update an iconic image that first appeared in the now defunct Western Standard: The infamous “Libranos” poster, “a satirical image of Liberal ministers of the Chretien era who corrupted politics.”

A decade and a half later, “the Libranos are back, with a new generation of corruption under Justin Trudeau,” and to mark the occasion, the Rebel is now offering a selection of items emblazoned with an updated version of the original picture.

“Trudeau and his team are as corrupt as ever,” the Rebel pitch notes.

“Show your defiance of this corrupt political culture by proudly displaying a gorgeous Libranos poster — or even wear it as a T-shirt or get it on a coffee mug!”

And while it hasn’t yet inspired a swag collection, Levant is also keeping a close eye on a new twist on the Alberta pre-election policy front — namely, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney’s “bizarre” plan to “bring approximately 10,000 newcomers in total to rural Alberta every year,” a proposal that Levant finds inexplicable.

“If you were to knock on 1,000 doors in Alberta and ask, ‘What is a key issue in this provincial election,’ I doubt a single person would say: ‘We need more immigration.'” he notes.

Not only is it a “federal matter,” but there’s already “massive unemployment in Alberta … worse than any other province other than the Atlantic,” he notes.

“Alberta’s unemployed people are the most skilled unemployed people in Canada. They’re out of work because of Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau. There is no shortage of workers. There is a shortage of jobs. So Jason Kenney wants to bring in more workers? Before our existing Canadian unemployed are hired?”

Kenney’s gambit “is a solution in search of a problem. It doesn’t make sense.”

This, he says, “is Jason Kenney trying to win the love of the CBC, trying to prove how woke he is.”

And he’s once again leading the charge to support former U.K. Rebel reporter Tommy Robinson after he was permanently banned from both Facebook and Instagram due to concerns over potential hate speech — “an act of outrageous political censorship,” in Levant’s view.

“Depending on how you measure, Tommy was either the most popular Facebook page in the U.K. or the third most popular, after Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn,” he notes.

“In terms of viewer engagement, it was huge. He really was a one-man news network, the alternative to everyone and everything in the UK media party. And Facebook simply deleted it.”

Also making headlines in the Rebelverse this week:

While acknowledging the death of seven Halifax children who came to Canada as refugees from Syria in 2017 as a “gut-wrenching tragedy,” Toronto mission specialist David Menzies wonders whether Trudeau “would have attended a vigil for a fire that had taken the lives of non-refugees,” and points out that the prime minister was a no-show at the vigil for Burnaby, B.C. 13-year-old Marissa Shen, who was “allegedly murdered by a Syrian refugee.”

wonders whether Trudeau “would have attended a vigil for a fire that had taken the lives of non-refugees,” and points out that the prime minister was a no-show at the vigil for Burnaby, B.C. 13-year-old Marissa Shen, who was “allegedly murdered by a Syrian refugee.” Alberta correspondent Sheila Gunn Reid finds the apparent lack of records on the vetting of Syrian refugees — or, at least, the official response to her access to information request for such documents — to be “chilling.”

On the centre-left side of the Canadian political mediaverse, meanwhile, Rabble political writer Karl Nerenberg parses the numbers from the latest round of byelections, and —like just about everyone else to wade into the results — finds “good and bad news for all parties,” but on balance, he thinks the New Democrats have the most to celebrate.

“Pundits predicted Burnaby South would be a close race; the NDP won by fewer than 600 votes in 2015. This time, however, Jagmeet Singh had a 2,900 vote margin — although, in proportionate terms, Singh’s vote only slightly exceeded the combined Green and NDP vote of last time,” he notes.

“Some recent polls had the NDP in single digits in Quebec, while showing new life for the previously moribund Bloc Québécois. In that light, the 26 per cent second-place finish in Outremont for NDP candidate Julia Sanchez does not look half bad.”

He also believes that the surprisingly strong showing by Maxime Bernier’s fledgling People’s Party in Burnaby South “will unsettle Conservatives, and probably push the official opposition party further to the right.”

Meanwhile, Rabble “activist-blogger” Brent Patterson details the “highly successful” counter-protest to the United We Roll truck convoy that descended on the capital last week to protest everything from the federal carbon tax to the UN global contract on migration.

The rally, which was organized by Indigenous Solidarity Ottawa and Ottawa Against Fascism, brought “150 to 200 people” to the Hill, and “created a temporary space in front of Parliament Hill that challenged the alt-right and the violence of the fossil fuel economy,” he notes.

“In doing so, it notably engaged in the real prefigurative politics of bringing grassroots movements together,” which, he concludes, “was a good example of what we must continue to build.”

The United We Roll protest — and the overall political mood in Alberta on the eve of an election — prompted Ricochet writer Aaron Saad to wonder if his home province is “trapped in an abusive relationship with its fossil fuel industry.”

“Having grown up there, I can’t help but find the plight behind these efforts especially heartbreaking,” he acknowledges.

“But there’s also something frustrating about seeing so much hope and effort dedicated to reviving that industry.”

Finally, Press Progress turns the spotlight on the Canadian Consumer Rewards Coalition, a new “grassroots” — quotation marks theirs, not ours — group that “stands up for big banks and credit card companies” by making the case for why “getting nickel-and-dimed” by bank and credit card fees “is actually a good thing.”

“The coalition — established last year with support from corporate lawyers, lobbyists, downtown Toronto public relations experts and the banking community – wants everyone in Canada to know that moves to regulate bank and credit card fees could lead big banks and credit card companies to punish their customers,” PP reports.

To get the message out, they’ve “been busy on Facebook, posting videos and running sponsored ads, warning consumers that any move to cap bank and credit card fees could cause profitable corporations to retaliate by taking away your consumer reward points.”

This week, the Health Sciences Association of Alberta (HSAA), a union which represents about 26,000 health-care workers, held a press conference to denounce the UCP’s stance so far on health care.

Health Sciences Association of Alberta president Mike Parker speaks at HSAA headquarters in Edmonton on Tuesday. Parker’s group doesn’t trust the United Conservative Party’s vision for health care in Alberta. ( Codie McLachlan / Star Edmonton )

However, the party has not released its full platform and voters don’t know what the scope of its health-care plan is in the lead up to the province’s spring election. “We believe it needs to be the top priority in the election, that Albertans need to know what’s truly at stake. And, clearly, what is at stake, if Jason Kenney and the UCP are elected, is the future of our universal, accessible, affordable, and inclusive health-care system,” said Mike Parker, president of HSAA. The audio clip, recorded just before she was nominated to be the United Conservative candidate for Banff-Kananaskis in late October, is of Miranda Rosin, and she responds to a panel question about health-care issues saying, “We need to look at a two-tier system.

“So that we can get those who have worked hard for their money to get out of the system if they would like to … we can decrease the wait times for those who are still in the public system,” she said.

The clip was posted to social media, cut with just her comments. But Star Edmonton obtained the full audio recording and confirmed the authenticity of it since Rosin is introduced by a moderator and referred to as “Miranda” throughout the panel discussion. The comments sparked some backlash on Twitter and played a part in HSAA holding its press conference earlier in the week. A statement from the UCP, sent to Star Edmonton on Wednesday, noted that Kenney signed the party’s “Health-Care Guarantee,” which upholds the party’s commitment to maintain or increase health spending and promises access to universal health care. “This is a key part of our platform that our candidates are supportive of, notwithstanding any selectively clipped comments made prior to their nomination,” the statement said in response to questions about Rosin’s comments.

But Parker said his concerns are still justified after hearing Rosin’s comments in the clip. And the signing of the party’s health-care guarantee didn’t temper his fears because Kenney didn’t discuss “the level of privatization,” Parker said.

So far, Kenney has floated the idea of allowing private clinics to bid into the public system in the hopes it helps “get better results at lower costs.” Kenney has also promised to have a review done of Alberta Health Services if he takes office in the spring, saying that he wanted to identify inefficiencies in the administration. “We need to reduce the massive bureaucracy and administration that has grown at the centre of the system,” he said during the announcement last week. A common criticism of the health-care system in Alberta, from both the governing NDP and the UCP, is that wait times for certain procedures are too long. For Parker, it isn’t the need for more private options that will help the backlog, but more government investment. “When you look at where wait lists have come from,” Parker said, “historically, it’s been the defunding of health care for the last 30 years, and this systematic defunding of the health-care system has degraded that system to the point where it can’t cope with growth in the province.”

The dichotomy between more public funding or more private options is at the centre of the (at times) ideological debate around health care in Canada. Proponents of privatization often claim more private options could help reduce backlogs in the public system, but Kimberlyn McGrail, a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Centre for Health Services and Policy Research, says the research doesn’t back that up. “There’s no research of it that shows that they help at all with waiting lists within the public system, that they’re any cheaper, that they’re any more efficient or that they provide any higher quality,” she said of two-tiered systems during a recent interview. “They tend to be more expensive, with worse outcomes and no increased capacity on the public side.” When asked about private clinics bidding into the public system, McGrail said this could be a case of more private delivery, rather than private financing. Private delivery operators are common in the Canadian health system; while publicly funded, they operate as independent business owners and provide various services. There are some instances where private delivery could be helpful, such as increasing capacity for a specific surgery. If all of a sudden, a lot of people need one type of surgery, private options could help alleviate some of the burden on the public system for that procedure, McGrail said. However, McGrail said having a two-tiered system, where delivery and financing are privatized, does little to ease backlogs and wait times in the public system. “If we want people who have more money to pay more, why don’t we raise taxes and let all people who have more money contribute more, and not just the ones who have cataract surgery?” she said. “(Because) what you’re doing, in a sense, is you’re saying that people who happen to have money, and happen to have health-care needs, somehow need to pay more than other people.” Kieran Leavitt is an Edmonton-based reporter.

By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the public support on Thursday of a top political ally, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over a deepening political scandal.

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

""Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,"" she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal ""to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.""

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau's then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould's remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau's leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau's team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

""The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,"" said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that ""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that's exactly what we have done ... we've also done it in a way that has respected our laws"".

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

“I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal on Thursday.

Wilson-Raybould provided the House Justice committee with a more than three-hour testimony Wednesday night about the events leading up to an explosive Globe and Mail story three weeks ago, when it was first reported that she had been pressured by officials in the Prime Minister’s Office to allow the Quebec construction giant to settle for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). The former attorney general told the committee that between September and December she experienced a “concerted and sustained effort” by 11 officials to interfere in her role. It also reached a point where she felt she was receiving “veiled threats” aimed at pressuring her into providing SNC-Lavalin a DPA.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the events shortly after her testimony.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally. I therefore completely disagree with the former attorney general’s characterization of events,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal.

After appearing at the Justice committee, Wilson-Raybould said she doesn’t expect to be removed from the Liberal Party.

“I don’t anticipate being kicked out of caucus. I was elected by the constituents of Vancouver Granville to represent them as a Liberal Member of Parliament,” she said.

After the Justice Committee meeting on Wednesday, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau to resign as Prime Minister of Canada. He said the prime minister no longer had the “moral authority” to lead the country. He also called for an RCMP investigation into the behaviour of Trudeau and the other officials named by Wilson-Raybould in her testimony. Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that to his knowledge, none of the 11 officials who Wilson-Raybould named as playing a part in the government’s attempt to pressure her had been contacted by the RCMP. Asked about a potential investigation on Thursday, the RCMP said they had no information to provide.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh reissued a call for a public inquiry into the allegations after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. He said “everything” was still on the table and that Trudeau “might need to resign” after an inquiry.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May also renewed her call for an independent investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair on Thursday. “In light of yesterday’s testimony from Ms. Wilson-Raybould, it is more urgent than ever that all the players in this sordid saga are called to account for their actions,” May said in a statement.

In what The Guardian described as a “searing testimony” to a committee in Canada’s House of Commons, Jody Wilson-Raybould described a “consistent, sustained and inappropriate effort” by senior officials close to Trudeau to dissuade her from prosecuting Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin over accusations of fraud and bribery.

The former minister of justice and attorney general said the alleged pressure campaign included “veiled threats” by the officials, who feared the company might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

Wilson-Raybould claimed that the head of the federal civil service told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

However, under questioning from legislators from the ruling Liberal Party, the former minister said did not feel the pressure exercised on her had crossed the line into illegality.

Earlier this month, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that aides close to the PM had lobbied Wilson-Raybould to pursue a “deferred prosecution agreement” against SNC-Lavalin that would allow the company to escape with a fine. This allegation “forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts”, reports Reuters.

Wilson-Raybould was demoted unexpectedly in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She told the committee that she believes the SNC-Lavalin case prompted her demotion.

Following the hearing, Canadian opposition leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to resign.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” said the Conservative Party leader. “And that is why I am calling on Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.”

But Trudeau told a press conference in Quebec on Wednesday that he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of events.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” he said, adding that Canadians would have their say on his administration in the upcoming federal election, in October.

Crisis

The scandal “has become the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s administration”, says The Guardian.

SNC-Lavalin, one of the world’s largest engineering and construction companies, is facing fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m “in bribes it is alleged to have offfered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011”, reports the BBC.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will “vigorously defend itself” against the allegations.

The row has raised questions about whether the Trudeau government behaved in a way “that was ethically or legally problematic”, says The Globe and Mail. Canadians “have a right to answers” and “if they don’t like them, things could turn out very badly for the Trudeau government”, the newspaper adds.

The Choices

But Hamish Telford, a political science professor at British Columbia’s University of the Fraser Valley, told Vancouver-based site CityNews that despite Wilson-Raybould’s seemingly damning testimony, Trudeau is likely to continue as usual and wait for the election.

“Maybe Justin Trudeau feels fairly confident that once people are making the choice between him and Andrew Scheer and [New Democratic Party candidate] Jagmeet Singh, that we’ll choose him,” Telford said.",MEDIAWATCH:Canada PM rejects resignation call,Newsroom Panama,https://www.newsroompanama.com/media-watch/mediawatchcanada-pm-rejects-resignation-call

By Derek Baker, February 27 2019 —

Canadian governments are plagued by strict party discipline and leader-dominated election campaigns. Backbenchers rarely vote out of party lines. When they’re allowed to, it’s apparently a big deal — ‘the party will allow this to be a free/conscious vote’ plasters headlines whenever it occurs.

Likewise, the provincial level is also riddled with strict party discipline and leadership domination. Last November, Robyn Luff, a member of the legislative assembly from the New Democratic Party, was kicked out of caucus after releasing a letter decrying the party’s leadership prohibiting MLAs from stepping out of line. In Luff’s Nov. 5 letter, she claimed that “when Ministers and MLA’s (sic) come into the house to vote they will say ‘what are we voting for? Are we for or against this?’ They have no idea what we’ve been talking about in the house- all they need to know is what they are being told to do.”

The Official Opposition doesn’t look any better. Trampling over a constituency’s nomination process, UCP leader Jason Kenney recently appointed Len Rhodes for the Edmonton-Meadows riding. During the vote for Bill 9: Protecting Choice for Women Accessing Health Care Act, every single UCP MLA abstained from voting during a walkout. You can’t claim that all 26 UCP MLAs independently came to the decision to walk out on the vote.

Restricting the ability of MLAs and MPs to vote as they please is highly problematic for a first-past-the-post electoral system. What’s the point of electing representatives for your riding if they’re just a voiceless rubber stamp for whatever a party’s leadership wants?

Sure, backbenchers would still likely vote along party lines if they weren’t whipped, but it’s a persistent problem in Canadian politics from a representation standpoint.

That’s why I was initially excited when the UCP proposed their democratic reform policy on Feb. 14. Among several policy points, one was to allow “free votes for MLAs on everything not deemed a confidence vote, or a key platform commitment.”

On the surface, this policy looks like it promotes the representative abilities of MLAs. But MLAs have always had the power to vote freely. The policy acknowledges that their MLAs already are restricted in their ability to do so. Also, what votes will count as a “key platform commitment?” Again, this will be left to the party’s leadership to decide, promoting leader-dominated politics.

Showing that the policy is nothing more than a façade to promote the independent decision-making ability of MLAs is the contradiction of the next policy point: “Stopping floor crossing by requiring that MLAs resign and seek a byelection before they can change parties.”

It’s understandable why the UCP would want to prohibit floor crossing. Since 2010, the only MLAs to cross the floor came from conservative provincial parties — 10 from the Wildrose and four from the Progressive Conservatives. We wouldn’t want to have an exodus of UCP MLAs leaving if they’re fed up with Kenney’s leadership, would we?

But strange is the party’s claim that since electing the NDP government, Albertans are frustrated that they’ve been “betraying voters’ trust with floor crossings.” Discounting the floor crossings resulting from former PC and Wildrose MLAs joining the UCP following the merger, the only MLA to formally cross the floor to join another party since 2015 is Sandra Jansen, from the PCs to the NDP.

MLAs should be permitted to cross the floor as they see fit. It’s the ultimate confirmation of their independence as legislators, rather than just being another whipped partisan cog in a leader-dominated machine.

Yes, constituents often base their vote on the party or leader rather than the actual local candidate. This is true in Canada as it is in other countries that use district-based electoral systems. Look south of the border and you’ll find Republican voters in Nevada still rather elect a dead brothel owner than his Democrat opponent. I’d bet a rock could run as a candidate in some Alberta ridings and still win.

If you’re unhappy that your MLA crossed the floor, it’s your prerogative to not vote for them again. But that shouldn’t inhibit an MLA from crossing the floor if they believe it would make them a better representative for their riding.

It’s time for strict party discipline to end. It further contributes to the unhealthy polarization of politics. This election season, ask candidates when they come to your door how they see themselves representing the riding itself rather than just toeing party lines. Ask them their opinion on their party’s leader. Eliminating party discipline will take more than a policy that only provides lip service by saying, ‘Okay, we’ll allow free votes — but not on every issue and you still need to be loyal to your party above all else.’",Party discipline just as much a problem in Alberta politics,thegauntlet.ca,http://www.thegauntlet.ca/party-discipline-just-as-much-a-problem-in-alberta-politics/

As any scholar of the Canadian left ...,"With his win in the federal bye-election in Burnaby South, New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh has an opportunity to put to rest some of his doubters both outside the party and, more importantly, within. Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This bye-election win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the New Democratic Party shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the party’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the National Democratic Party persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the bye-election, the National Democratic Party would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the party in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, New Democratic Party fundraising – already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election – continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the New Democratic Party out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this bye-election win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the bye-election was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the party announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the New Democratic Party. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the New Democratic Party can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the New Democratic Party in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the New Democratic Party to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilised members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this bye-election win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

Lavalin would be banned from federal business in Canada. ""For a period of approximately four months, between ...","OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reconsidering Jody Wilson-Raybould's future in the Liberal party after his former attorney general accused him, his senior staff and the country's top civil servant of putting her under relentless pressure to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and refused to say whether she still believes in his leadership.

""I completely disagree with the former attorney general's characterization of events,"" Trudeau said in Montreal, shortly after Wilson-Raybould concluded four hours of explosive testimony before the House of Commons justice committee. ""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said he will review all of Wilson-Raybould's testimony before deciding whether she can remain in the Liberal caucus or seek re-election this fall as a Liberal candidate.

Wilson-Raybould reiterated her intention to remain part of the Liberal team as she exited the committee room, even though she refused during questioning to say whether she still had confidence in the leader of that team.

""I'm not sure how that question is relevant,"" she said when asked by a Liberal colleague if she still has confidence in the prime minister.

During her testimony, which drew gasps from opposition MPs and the overflow crowd of observers in the committee room, Wilson-Raybould said she believes Trudeau shuffled her out the prestigious justice portfolio in mid-January because she refused to give in to pressure — and even ""veiled threats"" — to order a halt to a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal engineering giant was, and is, facing charges of fraud and corruption related to attempts to get business in Libya. A ""remediation agreement,"" a sort of plea bargain, would have headed off a trial and removed the possibility SNC-Lavalin would be banned from federal business in Canada.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould provided a detailed accounting of meetings and phone calls to back up her accusations, breaking three weeks of silence on the affair that has rocked the government, prompting her resignation from cabinet and the departure of Trudeau's most trusted adviser, Gerald Butts.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, speaking immediately after Wilson-Raybould's testimony finished, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern the country and should resign. He also called for a police investigation of Wilson-Raybould's claims.

The former minister told the committee she was ""hounded"" to end the prosecution for months after the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, had rejected the idea of negotiating a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin and long after she had unequivocally declared that she would not direct Roussel to reverse her decision.

While she believed it was inappropriate, Wilson-Raybould said she didn't consider the pressure to be illegal. She did not resign or directly raise her concerns with Trudeau after Sept. 17, when she first informed him that she would not intervene in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

She said she didn't speak directly to Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin again until Jan. 7, when he informed her he was about to move her out of the justice portfolio; she suggested the move was the result of her refusal to intervene in the prosecution, which he denied. She accepted a move to veterans affairs on Jan. 14 and did not resign from cabinet until Feb. 11, five days after an anonymously sourced allegation that she'd been improperly pressured first surfaced in the Globe and Mail.

""At the time, I did not see it as my responsibility to resign. I saw myself as the attorney general of the country who was doing her job to ensure and uphold the independence of the prosecutor and uphold the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

Trudeau has said there were vigorous discussions within government about the case but that he repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould that a decision on intervening to halt the prosecution was hers alone.

She disputed that version of events, saying Trudeau only offered some vague assurance after she confronted him directly at the Sept. 17 meeting, two weeks after Roussel had decided not to consider a remediation agreement.

""The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there was no (remediation agreement) there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

She said she explained the law to Trudeau and told him she ""had made up my mind"" to not intervene with Roussel. But she said Trudeau and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick continued to express concerns, with Wernick noting that Quebec was holding an election in a couple of weeks and Trudeau stressing that he is himself a Quebec MP.

""I was quite taken aback,"" she said, adding that she looked Trudeau in the eye and asked: ""Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? ... The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.' ""

Wilson-Raybould detailed instances of what she considered inappropriate pressure by Finance Minister Bill Morneau's chief of staff and others but said the pressure campaign escalated over the fall, even after SNC-Lavalin went to court to challenge Roussel's rejection of a remediation agreement.

Her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, was eventually summoned to an urgent Dec. 18 meeting with Trudeau's chief of staff, Katie Telford, and his then principal secretary, Butts. Citing text messages from Prince sent to her immediately after the meeting, Wilson-Raybould said the prime minister's top two aides wanted her to hire an external legal expert, possibly a retired Supreme Court justice, to give an opinion on the appropriateness of directing Roussel to reverse her decision on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

When Prince suggested that would be interference, Butts purportedly said, ""Jess, there is no solution here that does not involve some interference."" Telford said an external legal opinion would give the government ""cover"" and allow Trudeau to say he was doing something.

But the most egregious pressure came the following day, on Dec. 19, when Wilson-Raybould said she received what she deemed to be three ""veiled threats"" that she could lose her job from the clerk of the Privy Council, Wernick. The country's top civil servant last week told the committee he believes there was no improper pressure applied to Wilson-Raybould by him or anyone else.

According to Wilson-Raybould, Wernick told her that Trudeau wanted to know why SNC-Lavalin was not being offered a remediation agreement. He told her that the prime minister was ""going to find a way to get it done one way or the other"" and that it was not good for the attorney general to be ""at loggerheads"" with the prime minister.

In all, Wilson-Raybould said pressure was exerted on her or her staff by 11 people through approximately 10 phone calls, 10 meetings and numerous emails and text messages.

Trudeau did not dispute that the SNC-Lavalin case was a hot topic of discussion with Wilson-Raybould.

""Of course we had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions,"" he said.

But he added: ""I want to be absolutely clear here. The decision around SNC-Lavalin was Ms. Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone.""

Cooper, to conduct an inquiry into Dr. Cameron’s ‘depatterning’ work between ...","When Alison Steel was four and a half years old, her mother, Jean, was sent for psychiatric care at McGill University’s Allan Memorial Institute, part of the Royal Victoria Hospital, suffering from what is now believed to have been postpartum depression.

The outgoing woman of 33 who liked to play sports and socialize emerged from treatment at the Montreal institution months later a shell of her former self. She no longer displayed emotion with her only child, and took to sitting in the dark and scribbling cryptic codes. She would never hold Alison. She remained disabled until she died.

“In my childhood I was very much alone,” Steel said. “I spent my time in my room and my mother would just sit in the dark.”

Jean Steel had been the patient of Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, a renowned psychiatrist, who, it turned out, had subjected hundreds of patients between 1948 and 1964 to massive amounts of mind-altering drugs, repeated bouts of electroconvulsive shock therapy and tapes of words or phrases repeated hundreds of thousands of times in an attempt to “de-pattern” his patients — wash their brain clean in order to rebuild them. Cameron’s experiments, which were funded by the Canadian government, were also paid for in part by the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency — the CIA — which was funnelling money to mind-control research around the continent.

On Feb. 13, Steel, Marilyn Rappaport and roughly 40 other family members of patients who were treated by Cameron filed a legal action in Quebec Superior Court demanding payment of $1 million per family — $850,000 for physical and emotional damages, and $150,000 in punitive damages — from the Royal Victoria Hospital, the McGill University Health Centre and the Federal Government of Canada. The legal action states that Cameron’s research was funded in part by four grants from the Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare between 1948 and 1964, totalling $162,206, which would be equivalent to $1,696,350 in today’s dollars.

“The destructuring depatterning treatments caused permanent psychological damage to the patients,” the suit reads. “The institutional Defendants knew about or were wilfully blind to, and facilitated, approved … the experimental treatments performed by Dr. Cameron.”

The legal demand, described as a direct action, should be heard in court, or settled out of court, within two years, lawyer Alan Stein said. It was filed three weeks after an application for a class-action suit was filed in Quebec Superior Court by relatives of victims by the Consumer Law Group, seeking unspecified damages from the same defendants as Steel’s action, as well as the U.S. government. More than 300 relatives have signed onto that suit. Lawyer Stein said family members are able to join both legal actions.

In 1992, the Conservative government agreed to pay 77 of Cameron’s victim’s an ex gratia settlement of $100,000. Since then, Steel and a few other family members have been able to win court payouts from the federal government, on the requirement that they not discuss the settlements.

Family members came together last year to organize a group called Survivors Allied Against Government Abuse to figure out their legal recourse.

In a statement, the Trudeau government said it was reviewing the lawsuit application.

“The government of Canada believes in taking a fair and compassionate approach to victims and their families,” Department of Justice spokesman Ian McLeod said. “In this case, the government acknowledges the damages and painful scars of the victims who underwent the ‘depatterning’ treatment technique, as well as the impact on their families, and has taken action to provide assistance to those affected.

“The government of Canada asked a third party, George T.H. Cooper, to conduct an inquiry into Dr. Cameron’s ‘depatterning’ work between 1950 and 1965. The Cooper Report concluded (in 1986) that Canada did not hold any legal liability or moral responsibility in respect of these treatments.”

The McGill University Health Centre acknowledged that Cameron “carried out experiments at the Allan Memorial Institute during the ’50s and ’60s,” but said it wasn’t responsible for his actions.

The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.

“This is a dark chapter in the history of the Canadian government and I would like to see some kind of apology, as well as compensation, once and for all,” Stein said. “Those people were used as guinea pigs.”

“The Canadian government has been keeping this a huge secret since Day 1,” Steel said. “It’s barbaric how they treated those patients. I think the patients and their families that have suffered their whole lives deserve justice. … Not one patient came out of that hospital healed — they just came out worse.”

Join us and grow independent media in Canada At ...","The Trudeau government just ordered the CRTC to ensure it will better “promote competition, affordability, consumer interests and innovation” in Canada’s telecom industry. Earlier this month, the B.C. government made a throne speech pledge to tackle high cell phone bills.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut’ Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.

If politicians are getting the message that Canadian voters are fed up with high cellular bills, it’s because they pay the worst rates for mobile services in the developed world, as yet another recent study confirmed.

It wasn’t even close. Canada landed dead last by a long shot when researchers compared how much mobile data $45 can buy.

If Canadians want a proven path to lowering our sky-high cellphone bills and boosting competition, we should acquaint ourselves with the example of Israel. In that country a government minister made cellular price gouging his crusade. By the time he was done an oligopoly had been shattered, users’ bills had dropped by two-thirds or more, and the economy barely missed a beat.

The story begins in 2009, when a Likud party politician named Moshe Kahlon was reelected to the Knesset and appointed minister of communications.

At the time, Israelis were also paying high prices for cellphone service compared to countries in the OECD. Commanding those rates were Israel’s “big three”: Pelephone, Cellcom and Orange (now called Partner). Canadians take note: Our cellular market is dominated by a big three too: Bell, Rogers and Telus.

As minister, Kahlon pushed through reforms that made it easier for upstart competitors to take on Israel’s cellular oligopoly. (These policy changes are explained in some detail in the second half of this story under the sub-headline: How Israel chopped cell phone bills.) As new companies tried to steal away customers, the big three were forced to woo them to remain by offering new deals.

By 2011, typical plan prices had spiraled downward by 60 to 80 per cent. Plans that formerly ranged between 150-250 Shekels ($55 to $90 Canadian) reached rates as low as 29 to 99 Shekels a month ($10 to $35 Canadian). And they stayed there.

These weren’t the kinds of bare bones, data-only plans the Canadian government recently ordered our big three to offer in the name of providing affordability.

Israelis have their pick of various all-you-can-eat data and airtime plans at prices inconceivable in Canada today.

In this country, meanwhile, those ultra-basic data-only plans start at three times what the plans cost in Israel at $10.

Kahlon’s reforms, within three years, had saved consumers an estimated $6 billion (CDN) on their cell phone bills.

In Canada since 2009, by comparison, prices for desirable phone plans and market share among big players have remained among the highest in the world.

But of course any politician would be a fool to defy an oligopoly and the political might it wields, right? Not true for Moshe Kahlon. His reforms made him such a hero he started and leads his own political party, Kulanu, a member of Israel’s current coalition government.

“When Mr. Kahlon came into office he didn’t want to be a minister of communication,” said Amir Teig, a journalist who covered Kahlon for the Israeli business newspaper The Marker. The communication ministry was “third-tier” with low visibility, he told The Tyee.

Kahlon could have made friends with the big players in the mobile industry by turning a blind eye. Instead he took a very close look at them, and he didn’t like what he saw.

“It was a very concentrated market. The margins were some of the highest in the world. They paid huge dividends to highly leveraged stockholders,” said Teig. “You don’t have to be a professor in economics to see that this market had a huge problem. Prices were the high end of the prices in the OECD and profits were huge.”

Kahlon noted the cellular industry accounted for nearly five per cent of the GDP with very strong profit margins topping out at 40 per cent (as measured by EBITDA — earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization).

What struck Kahlon as out of whack in Israel remains the norm here in Canada. Our mobile sector has had even higher profit rates, averaging 45 per cent in 2015. The telecommunication sector as a whole in Canada was worth $48.7 billion a year and rising by 2016, representing about 2.4 per cent of the GDP.

After Kahlon’s reforms took hold, the bottom lines of Israel’s big three felt the shock. But the firms stabilized and, in the newly competitive market, reported EBITDA margins of about 10 points less on average.

Revolutionary lessons

What can Israel’s “cellular revolution” (as it’s now known) teach us in Canada?

Israeli governments had previously campaigned on reforms but had not succeeded in effecting much change. Then came Kahlon, “someone who remained connected to his modest roots, and was well-connected to the community,” Harvard Business School professor Joshua Margolis told The Tyee.

“He is a humble person who wants to do things that will benefit the general population — not in some grandiose demagogic way but rather in a way that can help the daily lives of people who were often neglected. He stayed connected to that so even when he had power as a minister it was important to him.”

Margolis specializes in business cases where leaders have faced strong headwinds and potential personal cost while making important decisions that advance a greater good.

Margolis has made a close study of Kahlon and Israel’s cellular revolution because, he said, “A number of other people had been in his position and shoes before and had blinked. He did not.”

Kahlon faced down the influence the big three wielded in the media and government. They could afford to pay lobbyists and buy advertising in all of the largest publications.

As his measures were scheduled to take effect, Kahlon fended off others in the government who asked him to back down and ignored attacks in the press. His own daughter once asked him if it was true he had declared personal bankruptcy as she had heard falsely reported on the television, according the case study Margolis wrote for the Harvard Business School.

“They will write whatever the companies that pay them for ads ask them to,” said journalist Teig of Israel’s larger media companies. One of the big three telecom players made moves to buy outright control of a major newspaper right as the reforms hit, according to Teig.

In Canada, the cellular industry has significant overlap with large media ownership. When cellular high prices get coverage, even in the public broadcaster CBC, telecom industry group talking points usually get prominent treatment.

Those talking points tend to be that Canada is a big country with sparse populations in many areas, so cellular customers are paying for investment in necessary infrastructure built by the big players. ""We're paying for a Lexus, but it's worth a Lexus,"" is how the author of one conservative think tank report put it.

But critics point out not everyone can afford a Lexus, and, as a 2017 report commissioned by the federal government noted, Australia manages to have much cheaper cell phone service despite its vast, lightly settled areas.

Perhaps, then, as Harvard’s Margolis argues, the missing factor in Canada is political courage.

Kahlon’s boldness was bolstered by soured public perception of big telcos, and recent events in Israel. “There was a convergence of factors. You had someone like Kahlon that cared about it, and who was able to listen to arguments on both sides. You had some of the press which were mobilizing and willing to create cover on calls for reform,” said Margolis.

The reforms also coincided with Israel’s equivalent of an “Occupy Wall Street” movement triggered by high dairy prices. All of this added up to create a more receptive public, said Margolis.

Leading the pro-reform media coverage was the paper employing Amir Teig. The Marker is a popular center-left business print daily. At the time, Kahlon was part of the right-wing Likud party. “When I met Kahlon the first time,” said Teig, “we were laughing and he said, whatever he does, we as a leftish media group are not going to support him.”

Teig assured Kahlon he and his paper would cover reforms on the industry fairly. Teig later learned that his editor in chief said the same thing to Kahlon.

How Israel chopped cell phone bills

Kahlon’s approach, put simply, was to set up conditions in the marketplace that would aggressively incentivize fast market capture for new entrants, and to take aim at every practice in place that made it prohibitive for customers to switch between companies.

This meant he had to counter industry lobbyist arguments. He insisted, for example, that the companies — and Israel’s job market — were strong enough to weather the transition, Margolis explains in his case study. Indeed, the fallout of price wars caused the big three companies to shed thousands of jobs. But because the industry has a high turnover rate, this largely meant simply not rehiring.

There were warnings and predictions of doom for the economy. Cell phone service companies were reliable sources of cash flow for larger companies that owned them and their dividend-earning investors. Companies threatened they would cease investing in infrastructure — a familiar warning from the big three to Canadian regulators when considering measures to increase competition.

But Kahlon persevered. And in fact, after reducing infrastructure investment the first year, the companies ramped it back up.

In 2014, the third year after the reforms took effect, Israel’s mobile sector spent the equivalent of 13 per cent of revenues on expanding infrastructure. This was higher than for Canada’s wireless industry, which has invested between 10 and 12 per cent in recent years.

Phone and service decoupling

Kahlon de-coupled monthly payments for the actual phones from service agreements. This meant that if a customer was unhappy with service or saw a better deal after pledging to pay down a new handset for two years, they could simply cancel their service plan and switch to a new company, while continuing to pay the original company the separated phone payments only.

In Canada, a customer would have to pay out any still-owing amount on their phone purchase price and part ways with the company entirely before leaving their rate plans, per their contracts. Therefore, they are likely to stick with their provider a full two-years — the government maximum term length set in 2013. When this locking-in was permitted in Israel, 90 per cent of customers would bear out their plans until the end, Kahlon pointed out, stifling competition.

This freeing of phone purchase payments from service agreements also, very significantly, curbed the tendency for companies to have exclusive agreements with hot handsets manufacturers like Apple, a major driver of consumer choice.

License tendering using long-range thinking

Kahlon anticipated issuing two new wireless licenses to firms aiming to compete with the big three companies, but wanted them to have a fighting chance. He aimed to ensure the new companies captured a meaningful share of the market on a set timeline. To accomplish this, Kahlon used a twist on one of the key tools governments have in bringing in mobile competition: issuing licences to use a newly available wireless spectrum.

Periodically, new spectrums of radio frequencies are made available to the cellular industry. The manner in which they are given out can have profound effects on the competitive landscape. Governments frequently award them to the highest bidders due to the massive boost the auctions can provide to national coffers.

Kahlon instead decided to set up a different scheme. He offered to completely repay the new cellular companies’ expensive license bids — essentially giving away the valuable spectrum — provided they reach market capture and tower coverage thresholds at set intervals.

The terms required capturing seven per cent of the markets within five years, and ensuring coverage of 90 per cent of the country within seven years. The coverage requirements were done with gradual threshold increases each year, and the license rebates were offered at one-seventh of the fee for each one per cent of market capture.

Two bid winners — Golan and Hot mobile — met those thresholds and became viable competitors, going on to capture a combined 20 per cent of the market at two million subscribers.

The government effectively sacrificed about $1.4 billion Shekels ($504 million Canadian) in license fees per the companies bids, to support the scheme that contributed to over 10 times as many dollars saved by Israeli households within five years.

Virtual operators

Kahlon greatly lowered roaming rates that the big three must offer to new entrants and forced them to lease their networks (at set rates that still produced profits) to MVNOs, “virtual operators” who have no physical infrastructure. He again ignored cries from the industry that this was unfair and would kill any incentive to continue investing in infrastructure — claims which proved untrue.

Kahlon touted the low rates that could be offered by these firms who needn’t recover infrastructure costs as a key part of the plan to effect change.

Several MVNOs became viable competitors. The only one reporting its numbers is Rami Levy at 200,000 subscribers or about two per cent of the market.

Meanwhile, back in Canada

Canada’s spectrum auctions during the period of Israel’s reforms and since primarily favoured accepting the highest bidders, earning typical short-term windfalls of millions or billions for government coffers on each occasion (a recent 2015 auction produced $58.5 million, another in 2014 produced $5.3 billion) but with some spectrum reserved for smaller companies.

While opening several new wireless frequencies over the years since 2008, Canada has required no commitments or incentives for any winners of the reserved spectrum to capture any specific market share or provide a specific area with coverage nor any measure that would seem to indicate the government is serious in ensuring new companies’ viability as competitors.

Canada’s regulators during this time have set a still-elusive goal of adding a “fourth competitor” in each of its provinces’ markets. The regulators’ method has been to set aside 40 per cent of the auctioned new spectrum for bidders that have less than 10 per cent of the market share.

The deep-pocketed big three predictably gobble up the remaining 60 per cent of the spectrum. And within years of said auctions they have a tendency to gobble up the new entrants, too. In one recent case they simply bought an entrant company’s still unused spectrum, sold to the big three buyer at a huge profit from the bidding price. Unlike in Israel where mergers have been blocked, the Competition Bureau in Canada allowed smaller companies that won auctions to sell out to the big three after a mere five-year legislated wait.

In March, the federal government will apparently take the same approach to auctions when it sells off the 600mhz spectrum

What about Israel’s approach allowing independent virtual operators (MNVOs) who do not have their own network towers to lease their network from large operators? The CRTC, as led by both Harper and Trudeau-appointed heads, has thus far accepted the industry argument that investment in infrastructure will be stifled if this is allowed.

Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains did ask the CRTC to look for a second time at its most recent decision shutting down “Wifi First” MVNOs that use the big three’s infrastructure.

A reversal of the original decision would have enabled virtual operators to enter the market, as in Israel where they are viable competitors. But Trudeau’s CRTC, headed by a former Telus executive and telecom lobbyist, simply reaffirmed the decision to block the companies.

Another barrier for new entrants in Canada has been the inability to secure deals for the hottest phones that are critical to competition. This difficulty is by design due to deals for exclusivity aggressively pursued and enforced by the big three. They understand that access to a new discounted iPhone or Galaxy will dictate a choice in service providers for a large portion of consumers.

To overcome this barrier, Wind Mobile found a way to secure older iPhones from a vendor that refurbished them. But Apple forced the vendor to cut their supply off, after receiving pressure from big three vendors with whom it has had agreements.

Wind Mobile changed its name to Freedom mobile, which is now backed by western Canada television cable giant Shaw and occupies a distant fourth place in the market. Freedom has managed to obtain agreements with Apple.

This week’s federal government directive to the CRTC to act to make the cell phone industry more competitive has the ring of déjà vu. When the Trudeau government took power three years ago it made similar noises.

After Trudeau appointed Bains minister of innovation, the first item in Bains’ ministerial briefing under “priorities and hot files” was “Telecommunications Competition and Access.”

Found in Bains’ mandate letter from Trudeau is a now nearly four-year-old phrase that resembles the order given this week to the CRTC. Trudeau back then directed Bains to “increase high-speed broadband coverage and work to support competition, choice and availability of services, and foster a strong investment environment for telecommunications services to keep Canada at the leading edge of the digital economy.”

If Trudeau and his government are serious this time about making that happen in the cellular sector, perhaps a field trip to Israel is in order.","If Canada Wants to Slash Cell Bills, Here’s How One Nation Did It",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/02/28/Slash-Cell-Bills-Israel/

TORONTO (AP) — Cabinet ministers rallied around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday, a day after his former attorney general testified that he inappropriately tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company in order to save jobs — a case that has shaken the government in an election year.

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that ""the prime minister would never apply improper pressure"" and expressed ""100 percent faith"" in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was ""entirely appropriate"" for his staff to talk with the justice minister's staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""That's exactly what we have done every step of the way.

""We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,"" he added. ""There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had ""approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn't think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould's testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau's office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament's justice committee to testify.

""I believe my evidence will be of assistance,"" Butts said in a statement.

Wilson-Raybould, who had already been demoted to veterans' affairs minister in January, resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12. She remains a member of Trudeau's Liberal party in Parliament.","Canada PM Trudeau, ministers deny improper pressure in case",seattlepi.com,https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Trudeau-ministers-deny-improper-pressure-13652778.php

SNC-Lavalin paid for Gadhafi son’s debauchery while he was in Canada: report John Ivison: Wilson-Raybould’s convincing testimony ...","OTTAWA — In a stunning appearance before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould accused the entire senior ranks of the federal government of making ‘veiled threats’ against her while attempting to interfere politically in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Sitting alone at a table in a packed basement room in Parliament’s West Block, Wilson-Raybould told the committee’s MPs that over a four-month period in late 2018 she was pressured by finance minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself — all of whom were eager for her to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges and negotiate a remediation agreement instead.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December of 2018 I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people in the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Wilson-Raybould said.

Wilson-Raybould said partisan concerns were repeatedly raised in connection with the SNC-Lavalin case, including by Trudeau, who she claims pointed out to her in a September conversation that he was himself a Quebec MP and raised the political consequences of prosecuting a large Montreal-based company during the then-ongoing Quebec election.

A corruption conviction for SNC-Lavalin, a massive Montreal-based engineering company, would mean the company is barred from bidding on federal procurement contracts for ten years. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

She said the conversations were “clearly inappropriate” and included the suggestion that “a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided.” She said one conversation with Wernick on Dec. 19, 2018, had her thinking of the Saturday Night Massacre, a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. Indeed, in a cabinet shuffle the following month, Trudeau moved Wilson-Raybould from her role as attorney general and justice minister to Veterans Affairs, a move she thought may have resulted from her refusal to comply with the prime minister’s wishes on the SNC-Lavalin case. However, she said, the PMO denied that this was the reason she was moved to a different cabinet portfolio.

Wilson-Raybould said it was not wrong for senior officials to raise concerns about job losses in the “early stages” of the decision, but once the decision was made, the “long sustained discussions about the job losses” crossed the line — and then became worse.

“Leaving aside job losses … where they became very clearly inappropriate was when political issues came up like the election in Quebec, like losing the election if SNC were to move their headquarters, conversations like that,” Wilson-Raybould said.

“Conversations like the one I had with the clerk of the privy council who invoked the prime minister’s name throughout the entirety of the conversation, spoke to me about the prime minister being dug-in, spoke to me about his concerns as to what would happen. In my mind those were veiled threats and I took them as such. That is entirely inappropriate.”

Speaking from Montreal after the committee testimony, Trudeau said he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of events, and said the decision on the SNC-Lavalin case was always “hers alone.” Yet he declined to respond to any of the specific allegations Wilson-Raybould made about comments from him and his senior staff.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff alway acted appropriately and professionally,” he said. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We of course had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions.”

Asked whether Wilson-Raybould should remain in caucus, Trudeau said he had not reviewed her testimony in full yet, and would make decisions on that once he had.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern and called on him to resign.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer said. “That is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation, if it has not already done so, into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former attorney general detailed in her testimony.”

He also called for Wernick’s resignation.

Asked if the RCMP was investigating allegations of political interference in the matter — or planned to investigate — the force’s deputy commissioner Gilles Michaud said “it would be inappropriate to confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said Wednesday evening that while Trudeau may eventually need to step down, for now his party is calling for a public inquiry to bring out the facts.

“What we need to do is get to the truth, and that’s what a public inquiry will do,” he said. “He may need to resign because of this, but … a public inquiry will get to the bottom, get to the heart of this.”

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony included detailed accounts of conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages with 11 senior government officials. “For most of these conversations, I made contemporaneous and detailed notes,” she said. “Notes, in addition to my clear memory, which I am relying on today among other documentation.”

The officials named in her testimony included Trudeau, Telford and Butts, who resigned last week amid controversy over his role in the SNC-Lavalin scandal; senior PMO advisors Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard; Morneau and his chief of staff, Ben Chin; and Wernick, the ostensibly nonpartisan head of the federal public service whose testimony before the committee last week some observers criticized for being partisan in tone and content.

After federal prosecutors decided on Sept. 4 against a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, it took only two days for Morneau’s chief of staff to contact Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince.

“He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this,” Wilson-Raybould said. “He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.”

She said the first time PMO staff contacted her office was Sept. 16, when Marques and Bouchard had a phone call with Prince.

“They said that they understand that the individual Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement, but the Director (of Public Prosecutions) does not,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said they started to discuss what a “reasonable solution” might look like, such as getting outside advice to the prosecutors, while acknowledging that “that there are limits on what can be done, and that they can’t direct.” She said they also brought up the “Quebec election context.”

It's the Quebec election right now, so we can't have that happen

On Sept. 17, she had a meeting with Trudeau that she had previously requested on another subject. Wernick was unexpectedly also in attendance. She said Trudeau raised the SNC-Lavalin case “immediately.”

“The prime minister asks me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there was no (deferred prosecution) there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal,” she said. She said she told him she had made up her mind, and was not going to interfere with the decision of federal prosecutors.

She said the discussion continued, with Wernick making the argument that the company could leave Canada if the prosecution continued.

“At that point (Trudeau) jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau,” Wilson-Raybould said. “I was quite taken aback. My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask (Trudeau) a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said ‘No, No, No — we just need to find a solution.’”

Two days later, on Sept. 19, she said Morneau spoke with her in the House of Commons.

“He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop, that they were inappropriate,” she said. But the next day, she said, her chief of staff had two phone calls from aides in Morneau’s office, including Chin.

After that, things went quiet for a while, Wilson-Raybould said. Then on Oct. 18, the PMO’s Bouchard called her chief of staff to suggest looking at the option of getting an external legal opinion on the issue.

The next day, SNC-Lavalin filed a Federal Court case challenging the prosecution service’s decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement. “In my view, this necessarily put to rest any notion that I might speak to or intervene with the (director of public prosecutions), or that an external review could take place,” she said.

Yet she went on to detail many more meetings and phone calls from PMO staff.

She met with Butts on Dec. 5, and she said she told him “how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate.”

“Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff, he said I needed to find a solution,” she said. She alleges he told her that the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which separated the prosecution service from the justice department, “was set up by (former Prime Minister Stephen) Harper,” and that he “does not like the law.”

The two final meetings came on Dec. 18 and Dec. 19. The first one had Butts and Telford meeting with Prince, and pushing her to find a solution. Wilson-Raybould read out text messages that Prince sent her after the meeting, including the allegation that Butts had said: “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.”

Prince also texted that Butts and Telford were keen on having Wilson-Raybould retain a former Supreme Court justice to get advice on the matter, saying it would “give us cover in the business and legal community” and “allow the PM to say we were doing something.”

“(Telford) was like ‘if Jody is nervous, we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper,’” Wilson-Raybould said Prince texted her.

The next day, she had a phone call with Wernick. “The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm, he wants to know why the (deferred prosecution) route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used,” Wilson-Raybould said. “He said ‘I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.’”

Wilson-Raybould said she told Wernick they were “treading on dangerous ground,” that the attorney general cannot act in partisan way and that “all of this screams of that.”

She said Wernick insisted that “it is not good for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at ‘loggerheads.’” She told him she was starting to have thoughts of the “Saturday Night Massacre.”

On Jan. 7, Trudeau called Wilson-Raybould to inform her she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. “I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter,” she said. “They denied this to be the case.”

Following her opening statement, Wilson-Raybould took six rounds of questions from Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs.

“I have to say that I am very shaken by what I’ve heard here today,” the NDP’s Murray Rankin said. “I’ve been a lawyer for over 40 years, I’ve taught a generation of law students about the rule of law, and what I’ve heard today should make all Canadians extremely upset.”

Liberal MPs focused many of their questions on why she didn’t immediately resign, and why she stayed in cabinet after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs in January (she subsequently resigned after the SNC-Lavalin story hit the media).

“I decided that I would take the prime minister at this word, I trusted him, I had confidence in him, and so I decided to continue on around the cabinet table with the concerns that I had around SNC because I took the prime minister at his word,” she said.

“Do you have confidence in the prime minister today?” asked Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault.

Wilson-Raybould paused for a long time before answering. “I’ll say this … I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the table, the cabinet table,” she said. “That’s why I resigned.”

Later, she was asked again by Liberal MP Jennifer O’Connell if she had confidence in Trudeau.

Said Wilson-Raybould, “I’m not sure how that question is relevant.”

Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This bye-election win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the New Democratic Party shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the party’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the National Democratic Party persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the bye-election, the National Democratic Party would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the party in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, New Democratic Party fundraising – already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election – continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the New Democratic Party out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this bye-election win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the bye-election was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the party announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the New Democratic Party. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the New Democratic Party can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the New Democratic Party in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the New Democratic Party to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilised members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this bye-election win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

By Susan Cornwell

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Freshman Democrats determined to walk a centrist path in the U.S. House of Representatives are testing party harmony between moderates and liberals, just as work on major issues including gun control and healthcare policy is getting underway.

Democrats took control of the House from President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in January thanks in part to party moderates who won seats formerly held by Republicans in November's midterm elections.

But these centrists already have upset some Democratic elders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's liberal wing by voting on occasion with the Republicans during their first couple of months in office. Republicans are in the minority in the House, but control the Senate.

Tensions flared this week after House Republicans managed to successfully amend a gun control bill with votes from 26 Democrats. Many of the Democrats who broke with the party line on Wednesday represent swing districts that had voted for Trump in 2016.

""How did Nancy Pelosi let this happen?"" Justice Democrats, a liberal political action committee that helped elect new Democratic star Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in November, asked on Twitter after the vote.

The episode highlights the political tightrope being walked by several dozen freshman who helped to clinch the House majority for Democrats in November by expanding into Republican territory. There currently are 235 Democrats, 197 Republicans and three vacancies in the 435-seat House.

The centrists have not gotten as much attention as Ocasio-Cortez during their first months in office, and their differing positions from the party's liberals on policies such as government-run healthcare have at times put them at odds.

They also already have Republicans on their backs for the next election in 2020. Many of the 55 seats Republicans plan to target next year are held by freshman Democratic lawmakers who captured a previously Republican-held seat last year or prevailed in districts Trump won in 2016.

Representative Joe Cunningham, 36, did both when he won a South Carolina district in November that had not elected a Democrat to the House since before he was born. Cunningham defeated Republican rival Katie Arrington by less than 2 percentage points in a district Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2016.

On Wednesday, Cunningham was among the Democrats who supported the Republican amendment calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency criticized by liberals like Ocasio-Cortez, to be notified when an illegal immigrant in caught trying to buy a gun.

Cunningham, a gun owner, said the next day he saw the amendment as minor. He added that it should not detract from the fact that the House had passed a gun control measure for the first time in two decades, calling for universal background checks on gun purchases.

In an interview on Tuesday, Cunningham was unapologetic for sometimes siding with Republicans. He has done it around a dozen times since January, mostly on procedural votes.

""I will be an independent check and not toe the party line whenever I disagree,"" Cunningham told Reuters. ""I'm not going to let the national party or the national message drive my message at home.""

Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, another Democratic freshman, said, ""I just do what I think is right,"" after straying from his party's line on a previous Democratic proposal banning funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall. Van Drew also supported the Republican gun amendment.

'JUST VOTE NO'

The House Democratic leadership was divided this week on members breaking with the party line. Pelosi told reporters on Thursday she did not approve, even on procedural votes.

""Just vote no, because the fact is, a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side,"" Pelosi said.

Other Democratic leaders took a more relaxed view.

""It's OK to vote your district,"" said Representative James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership who, like Cunningham, represents a South Carolina district.

""We have a very diverse caucus,"" Clyburn added. ""I wish people would not compare us to the Republicans, where everybody looks alike. We've got varied backgrounds and experiences that we have to take into account.""","Centrist Democrats stray on votes, roiling House majority party",Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/centrist-democrats-stray-votes-roiling-house-majority-party-180216861.html
93,Politics,2019-03-01T18:07:00.0000000Z,"So it’s important to be clear now about what “pragmatism” really means, and why the Democratic Party ought to abandon it altogether. This is not a new conflict among Democrats, of course.","And yet, amid the party’s decisive shift leftward, pragmatism threatens once again to smother ambitious new policies in the crib. “Do I think we could cross every ‘t’ and dot every ‘i’ in 10 years?” Klobuchar said when asked about the Green New Deal. “Actually, I think that would be very difficult to do.” Such caution inspires portrayals of her as a plain-speaking politician who doesn’t pander, an incrementalist who doesn’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good—a doer, not a dreamer. But one person’s realism is another other person’s myopia: What is possible tomorrow is shaped by what is attempted today, however impossible the odds seem.

Pragmatism is as much a political strategy as a legislative one. Most voters are realists, not zealots, the thinking goes; by embracing pragmatism, presidential candidates like Klobuchar can win over this silent majority. It’s easy to see the appeal of such an approach in this political moment. Polling has shown that Democratic voters are eager to elect anyone who can defeat Trump—and would prefer that the party nominate the candidate with the best chance of beating him. Some argue that the best such candidate, given the president’s extremism, would be a centrist pragmatist.

“Despite all the talk about how ‘all the energy is on the left,’ progressive populism and democratic socialism underwhelmed in the primaries and were close to shut out in competitive general elections,” Jim Kessler and Lanae Erickson, of the Third Way think tank, argued after last year’s midterms. “The actual voting energy in the midterms propelled mostly mainstream Democrats who closely matched their purple and red districts or states.... Presidential candidates should not conflate that with appealing to the far left with populist rhetoric and a democratic socialist agenda.”

It’s true that most voters do not fall into neat ideological boxes. As Lee Drutman found in 2017, most social and racial conservatives have liberal economic views, while liberals, contra much of the reporting on the divide between Sanders and Clinton supporters, were in broad agreement on economic issues. Moreover, as New York magazine’s Eric Levitz wrote in 2017, “people generally cast their ballots on the basis of which candidate or party they identify with—which is to say, the one that seems to best represent people like them.” This generally favors the political party pushing for greater, more affordable health care—but also means that it doesn’t make political sense to put bumpers on hypothetical policies, which dampens voter enthusiasm.

Pragmatism doesn’t track as a legislative argument, either. There is justified skepticism, given the Senate’s structural favoritism toward Republicans, that any major Democratic effort can become law. But this is also true of any major piece of legislation at this point, whether it be universal or incremental. It’s possible, for instance, that Klobuchar’s hypothetical smaller-scale health care push could hold on to more Democratic votes than Medicare for All—but there is no sense that it would win any more votes from Republicans. Despite the label, there’s nothing really that pragmatic about these policies, at least in this hyper-partisan moment. (The actual pragmatic position is the one that no Democratic candidate has taken: If they want to pass any meaningful legislation, they must abolish the filibuster. For now, however, that remains a curious third rail among leading Democrats.)

As they travel across Iowa and New Hampshire, Klobuchar and other moderate Democrats running for president would do well to remember the campaign of another Minnesota pragmatist, Walter Mondale. In December of 1983, The New York Times observed a sense of nervousness among his supporters: “Even some Democrats supporting Mr. Mondale voice concerns that, despite his elaborate organization, the candidate’s stolid, low-key personality and his cautious, pragmatic approach have left many Democrats uninspired.” Eleven months later, the Democratic Party lost every state but the one Mondale hailed from. There’s no reason to believe that a pragmatic nominee today, whether from Minnesota or anywhere else, would be more inspiring.",The Overdue Death of Democratic “Pragmatism”,The New Republic,https://newrepublic.com/article/153165/overdue-death-democratic-pragmatism

Those moderates “insist they are not going to be dissuaded from voting with their districts, and many are ...","It appears that what remains of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party is dead. Or at least has no voice.

The party of abortion, sodomy, and socialism is now under the firm control, apparently, of a 29-year-old former bartender who proclaims herself a democratic socialist and already shows signs of the totalitarian impulses so common to her ilk.

Such is the iron control the party’s radicals have achieved that an old party hand cannot even say something nice about a Republican, as Joe Biden learned the other day. He said Vice President Pence was a “decent guy.” It was a big mistake.

Upshot? The GOP better stiffen its spine to fight these totalitarian central planners.

No Voting With the GOP. Period.

According to the Washington Post, moderates in the Democratic Party received marching orders yesterday: Shut up and do what you’re told, or face the equivalent of a firing squad.

“House Democrats exploded in recriminations Thursday over moderates bucking the party, with liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threatening to put those voting with Republicans ‘on a list’ for a primary challenge,” the Post reported.

And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the elderly leftist from California, agrees. “We are either a team or we’re not,” she warned, the Post reported.

Ocasio-Cortez, the face that launched a thousand Facebook memes, threatened party moderates with exile. “Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez,” the Post reported, “said she told her colleagues that Democrats who side with Republicans ‘are putting themselves on a list.’”

Ocasio-Cortez issued a not-so-subtle Stalinist threat, the Post reported, after the GOP outfoxed Democrats on an amendment to a bill that would expand federal background checks before one can purchase a firearm.

That amendment, defeated in committee, required Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to be notified if an illegal alien tried to purchase a firearm. Using a motion to recommit, which gives the minority party a last shot at amending a bill, Republicans reintroduced it on the floor, where 26 Democrats helped pass it.

“That infuriated liberals who have railed against ICE’s role in conducting mass deportations and embarrassed Democratic leaders who couldn’t keep their members in line on a high-profile bill,” the Post reported.

Thus, Ocasio-Cortez’s spokesman told the Post, “she said that when activists ask her why she had to vote for a gun safety bill that also further empowers an agency that forcibly injects kids with psychotropic drugs, they’re going to want a list of names and she’s going to give it to them.”

The problem for Pelosi and her colleague from New York 14? Democratic Congressmen from pro-Trump districts. Those moderates “insist they are not going to be dissuaded from voting with their districts, and many are warning that majority control is at stake.”

Reported the Post:

Inside the Democratic meeting, one of those freshmen — Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (N.M.) — reacted sharply to Ocasio-Cortez’s comments and rose to urge her colleagues to respect the political reality of representing a swing district, according to multiple people present....

Publicly and privately, Pelosi has urged members to treat the Republican motions as procedural feints that should be routinely ignored. “Vote no — just vote no,” she told reporters Thursday, “because the fact is, a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side.” But [Representative Steny] Hoyer and [Representative James] Clyburn believe that is untenable when Republicans stand ready to use those votes as political cudgels against vulnerable Democrats.

Say Nothing Nice

How much control do party radicals have over the party’s elderly leaders?

The Hill reported yesterday that former Vice President Joe Biden, still contemplating a run for president, permitted a left-wing lesbian to upbraid him for calling Vice President Mike Pence a “decent guy.” Biden was speaking at a foreign policy forum in Nebraska.

The reprimand came from failed gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, one of the stars of Sex in the City, a pornographic television program about the sexual adventures of four women in New York City.

“@JoeBiden you’ve just called America’s most anti-LGBT elected leader ‘a decent guy,’” she tweeted. “Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community.”

Like an old man afraid his kids would put him in a nursing home if he didn’t mind them, Biden quickly gave in.

You’re right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage.

But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.

The chart below shows which candidate these voters think is the most progressive. No one gets anywhere near Bernie on that axis.













Some of the more conservative Democratic candidates-- both presidential and congressional-- are hoping that voters confuse anti-Trump with progressive. They're not necessarily related. Plenty of conservative Democrats have realized that posturing against Trump is popular with the activist Democratic base. Even more popular with the activist Democratic base, however, is Medicare-For-All. The new Medicare For All Act (H.R. 1384) was introduced this week by Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) with 106 co-sponsors -- from full-on progressives like AOC (D-NY), Joe Neguse (D-CO), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Ro Khanna (D-CA) to members normally thought of as part of the Republican wing of the Democratic Party like Gregory Meeks (New Dem-NY), Adam Schiff (New Dem-CA), Vicente Gonzalez (Blue Dog-TX) and Ann Kirkpatrick (New Dem-AZ).





A couple of months ago, Jake Johnson wrote that ""Confronting the question most commonly asked of the growing number of Americans who support replacing America’s uniquely inefficient and immoral for-profit healthcare system with Medicare for All-- 'How do we pay for it?'-- a new paper released Friday by researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) shows that financing a single-payer system would actually be quite simple, given that it would cost significantly less than the status quo. 'It’s easy to pay for something that costs less,' Robert Pollin, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and lead author of the new analysis, declared during a panel discussion at The Sanders Institute Gathering in Burlingon, Vermont, where Pollin unveiled the paper for the first time.""

According to the 200-page analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) Medicare for All Act of 2017, the researchers found that “based on 2017 US healthcare expenditure figures, the cumulative savings for the first decade operating under Medicare for All would be $5.1 trillion, equal to 2.1 percent of cumulative GDP, without accounting for broader macroeconomic benefits such as increased productivity, greater income equality, and net job creation through lower operating costs for small- and medium-sized businesses.”



The most significant sources of savings from Medicare for All, the researchers found, would come in the areas of pharmaceutical drug costs and administration.



In a statement, Pollin said his research makes abundantly clear that the moral imperative of guaranteeing decent healthcare for all does not at all conflict with the goal of providing cost-effective care.



“The most fundamental goals of Medicare for All are to significantly improve healthcare outcomes for everyone living in the United States while also establishing effective cost controls throughout the healthcare system,” Pollin said. “These two purposes are both achievable.”



As Michael Lighty, a Sanders Institute fellow former director of public policy for National Nurses United, put it during the Gathering on Friday, “We really can get more and pay less.”



...“Medicare for All promises a system that is fairer, more efficient, and vastly less expensive than America’s bloated, monopolized, over-priced and under-performing private health insurance system,” [Columbia University professor Jeffrey] Sachs said. “America spends far more on healthcare and gets far less for its money than any other high-income country.”

Josh Harder ran for Congress in a northern portion of the Central Valley, CA-10, which runs from Turlock to Modesto and north to Riverbank, Ripon, Manteca and Tracy. The district has been trending blue and he ousted Republican incumbent, Jeff Denham. Obama beat his two GOP opponents by 3 points each and Hillary beat Trump by 3 points. Harder beat Denham more thoroughly last year-- 115,945 (52.3%) to 105,955 (47.7%), winning in both Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties.





All 7 of the California freshmen campaigned on a version of single payer, but only 4 of them-- Mike Levin, Katie Porter, Katie Hill (New Dem) and Harder (New Dem)-- have signed on as co-sponsors of Jayapal's Medicare-For-All legislation. McClatchy reporter Kate Irby noted that Harder ran and was elected on Medicare-for-All and wrote Harder's sponsorship ""will be a test of whether districts outside of the solidly Democratic will support the bold effort at health care overhaul as it takes steps towards becoming law-- which Republican groups have painted as a socialist dream."" A strong majority elected him because of-- at least in part-- Medicare-for-All. Most people in the establishment don't understand that kind of common sense popularity for something so helpful in people's lives.

“The key piece I’ve heard again and again and again ... is ‘please keep the promise to work for Medicare for all,’” Harder said, citing constituent concerns he heard during a listening tour on health care he’s been holding in his district.



“People want to see major progress on the No. 1 issue they care about,” he added.



...Members of the Blue Dog Coalition, a moderate [poor Irby doesn't understand the difference between the word ""moderate"" and the word ""conservative... maybe some day, but I doubt it] group of 27 Democrats focused on fiscal responsibility, have said they would not support such a proposal without a clear way to pay for it. It’s unclear how that would be done, and most are unwilling to consider a tax increase or furthering the country’s debt.



“I think it’s important to have the conversation, except without talking about how you’re going to pay for it, it’s a hollow promise,” said Blue Dog Rep. Jim Costa, D-Fresno. “It puts us in a position of further increasing Americans’ debt, which we all loathe.”









A slight majority of Americans favor a health care plan where everyone gets government-supplied health care, especially when they feel it will eliminate costs and guarantee coverage... Harder said he’s confident this is what the people of his district want and need, despite large price tags. Though he’s not an author of the legislation, he said he’s had frequent conversations with Jayapal over the past two years to make sure the bill addressed the needs of districts like his own, such as guaranteeing coverage and improving quality of care.



“People already pay way too much for health care,” Harder said. “We need a system that drives down costs and improves patient outcomes.”



Health care is a significant issue in Harder’s San Joaquin Valley district, where unemployment is consistently higher than the national average and air and water quality problems worsen the issue of pre-existing conditions. Harder and Democratic groups repeatedly spotlighted his Republican opponent’s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a campaign Harder ultimately won by about 10,000 votes.



There are over 350,000 uninsured individuals in the Central Valley, according to Harder’s office, one of the highest proportions of uninsured people in the state. Most of those who are uninsured in California are Latino and a quarter are millennials, and a third earn less than $25,000 per year.

It's a winning issue for people-- even if establishment politicians and corporate journalists don't understand that yet. The Democratic Party establishment should embrace the progressive agenda; its base has. And by the way, a new poll of Democratic primary voters in California, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina shows that addressing the climate crisis is a top tier issue for Democratic primary voters, shared only with universal healthcare coverage. So Medicare-For-All and The Green New Deal, the two most popular issues among Democratic voters-- and both totally unembraced and sabotaged by the party's congressional leadership which is too doddering to understand either.

By Derek Baker, February 27 2019 —

Canadian governments are plagued by strict party discipline and leader-dominated election campaigns. Backbenchers rarely vote out of party lines. When they’re allowed to, it’s apparently a big deal — ‘the party will allow this to be a free/conscious vote’ plasters headlines whenever it occurs.

Likewise, the provincial level is also riddled with strict party discipline and leadership domination. Last November, Robyn Luff, a member of the legislative assembly from the New Democratic Party, was kicked out of caucus after releasing a letter decrying the party’s leadership prohibiting MLAs from stepping out of line. In Luff’s Nov. 5 letter, she claimed that “when Ministers and MLA’s (sic) come into the house to vote they will say ‘what are we voting for? Are we for or against this?’ They have no idea what we’ve been talking about in the house- all they need to know is what they are being told to do.”

The Official Opposition doesn’t look any better. Trampling over a constituency’s nomination process, UCP leader Jason Kenney recently appointed Len Rhodes for the Edmonton-Meadows riding. During the vote for Bill 9: Protecting Choice for Women Accessing Health Care Act, every single UCP MLA abstained from voting during a walkout. You can’t claim that all 26 UCP MLAs independently came to the decision to walk out on the vote.

Restricting the ability of MLAs and MPs to vote as they please is highly problematic for a first-past-the-post electoral system. What’s the point of electing representatives for your riding if they’re just a voiceless rubber stamp for whatever a party’s leadership wants?

Sure, backbenchers would still likely vote along party lines if they weren’t whipped, but it’s a persistent problem in Canadian politics from a representation standpoint.

That’s why I was initially excited when the UCP proposed their democratic reform policy on Feb. 14. Among several policy points, one was to allow “free votes for MLAs on everything not deemed a confidence vote, or a key platform commitment.”

On the surface, this policy looks like it promotes the representative abilities of MLAs. But MLAs have always had the power to vote freely. The policy acknowledges that their MLAs already are restricted in their ability to do so. Also, what votes will count as a “key platform commitment?” Again, this will be left to the party’s leadership to decide, promoting leader-dominated politics.

Showing that the policy is nothing more than a façade to promote the independent decision-making ability of MLAs is the contradiction of the next policy point: “Stopping floor crossing by requiring that MLAs resign and seek a byelection before they can change parties.”

It’s understandable why the UCP would want to prohibit floor crossing. Since 2010, the only MLAs to cross the floor came from conservative provincial parties — 10 from the Wildrose and four from the Progressive Conservatives. We wouldn’t want to have an exodus of UCP MLAs leaving if they’re fed up with Kenney’s leadership, would we?

But strange is the party’s claim that since electing the NDP government, Albertans are frustrated that they’ve been “betraying voters’ trust with floor crossings.” Discounting the floor crossings resulting from former PC and Wildrose MLAs joining the UCP following the merger, the only MLA to formally cross the floor to join another party since 2015 is Sandra Jansen, from the PCs to the NDP.

MLAs should be permitted to cross the floor as they see fit. It’s the ultimate confirmation of their independence as legislators, rather than just being another whipped partisan cog in a leader-dominated machine.

Yes, constituents often base their vote on the party or leader rather than the actual local candidate. This is true in Canada as it is in other countries that use district-based electoral systems. Look south of the border and you’ll find Republican voters in Nevada still rather elect a dead brothel owner than his Democrat opponent. I’d bet a rock could run as a candidate in some Alberta ridings and still win.

If you’re unhappy that your MLA crossed the floor, it’s your prerogative to not vote for them again. But that shouldn’t inhibit an MLA from crossing the floor if they believe it would make them a better representative for their riding.

It’s time for strict party discipline to end. It further contributes to the unhealthy polarization of politics. This election season, ask candidates when they come to your door how they see themselves representing the riding itself rather than just toeing party lines. Ask them their opinion on their party’s leader. Eliminating party discipline will take more than a policy that only provides lip service by saying, ‘Okay, we’ll allow free votes — but not on every issue and you still need to be loyal to your party above all else.’",Party discipline just as much a problem in Alberta politics,thegauntlet.ca,http://www.thegauntlet.ca/party-discipline-just-as-much-a-problem-in-alberta-politics/

The National Republican Congressional Committee has singled out Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy as one Democrat who could face an uncertain future.

National press secretary Michael McAdams tells News 96.5 WDBO unless Murphy embraces some of the party’s more progressive positions like universal healthcare, the Green New Deal, and higher taxes, she could face tough opposition from within her own party in the 2020 primary.

“We heard just yesterday Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez telling a Democratic conference she will have a list and will be willing to challenge these folks if they don’t hop on board with these radical ideas like the Medicare for all plan we saw announced this week,” said McAdams.

“We’ve seen across the country that folks that are trying to be bipartisan, they’re getting primaried from the radical left and Stephanie Murphy will be the latest victim of them if she doesn’t get on board with these proposals,” said McAdams.

Murphy, who is a co-chairman of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition in Congress issued her own written statement to News 96.5 WDBO addressing the NRCC’s claim.

While the party’s left wing has gotten outside attention for its aggressive moves to push Democrats in their direction, the splinter faction is made up of the party’s moderates — many of them freshmen taking their first congressional votes.

They insist they are not going to be dissuaded from voting with their districts, and many are warning that majority control is at stake.

The Democratic Party is having a family feud over how to win back the White House. And no issue exemplifies the internal debate about whether to tack further left or move toward the middle better than healthcare and new Medicare for All proposals.

Some so-called Medicare for All measures floating around the Capitol nibble around the edges, like one popular version that merely extends the current federal health care system for the nation’s retirees down to 50 or 55-year-olds. But on Wednesday, a large block of progressives, led by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, from Washington, unveiled a Medicare for All bill that’s as simple as its name: It would eventually put all Americans — from infants all the way up to grandpas — under Medicare.

“Americans are literally dying because they can’t afford insulin or the cancer treatment they need,” Rep. Jayapal told a cheering crowd of more than 100 people outside the Capitol on Wednesday after unveiling the new Medicare for All proposal.

The bill has 107 Democratic sponsors, including 17 members of the freshman class. That’s down from the 124 co-sponsors of a similar version of the bill proposed last year, but Jayapal said the number of supporters will only grow in the coming days, weeks, and months.

“I am confident we will just continue to increase that number,” she said.

Progressive’s Medicare for All plan, however, doesn’t include a way to pay for its sweeping coverage, like free dental, vision, medical, and long-term care while also promising zero copays. That’s lead many more moderate Democrats to think of the legislation as more of catchphrase than a realistic proposal.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, from West Virginia, for one, said lawmakers should work on making the current health system solvent instead of promising a new federal entitlement to all Americans.

“We can’t even pay for Medicare for some that we’re supposed to be paying for. It’s going to go broke, and they’re scared to death,” Manchin told VICE News in the basement of the Capitol.

Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has raised questions about the price tag. “Single-payer is just about who pays. It’s not about what the benefits are. That is, administratively, the simplest thing to do, but to convert to it? Thirty trillion dollars. Now, how do you pay for that?” she recently told Rolling Stone.

Other more moderate Democrats are also asking their progressive colleagues to show them the details of how they plan to pay for these proposals, especially because health care spending is already skyrocketing.

“If it means people have to pay a 20 percent copay like Medicare that’s not good, because most people on Medicaid — all people — pay zero. So I think we’ve got to figure it out first,” Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, from Oregon, told VICE News at the Capitol.

""We can’t even pay for Medicare for some that we’re supposed to be paying for. It’s going to go broke, and they’re scared to death.""

Shrader’s a member of the more centrist New Democrat Coalition, a group of 101 lawmakers who on Wednesday sent party leaders a letter asking them to focus on shoring up so-called Obamacare, which would take GOP support in the Senate to accomplish. Working with Republicans in Trump’s Washington is anathema to many Democrats, but Schrader said that’s their aim.

“That’s exactly our focus. We’re trying to get something done, not making any big statement. Just trying to fix what’s out there,” he said.

But progressives brush aside the criticisms that single payer health care is unrealistic or too expensive.

“Somehow or another every major country on earth has managed to do it at significantly less cost than the United States of America,” Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of a growing number of 2020 presidential candidates in Congress, told VICE News while walking next to the trams under the Capitol.

Sanders previously spearheaded Medicare for All plans in 2016 when he first ran for president. And he still believes the nation needs to flip its current free-market thinking around health care on its head.

“The drug companies and the insurance companies make billions of dollars in profit every single year, and they pay their CEO’s exurbanite compensation packages, and they will fight,” he said. “They will spend unlimited sums of money to make sure we continue a dysfunctional, expensive system, but at the end of the day, we will win this fight.”

The changing tide

President Donald Trump has already derisively labeled the Democrats pushing proposals like Medicare for All, or even the Green New Deal, as radical socialists. That rhetoric worked for the GOP back in 2010 when the term helped whip up tea party fervor the GOP effectively used to wrest control of Congress from Democrats under former President Barack Obama.

In 2016, many in the Democratic Party seemed to try to do anything they could to avoid being labeled “socialists,” and party leaders at the Democratic National Committee helped tilt the primary to Hillary Clinton. But she lost the 2016 election, in part, by failing to appeal to working class voters in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

After that historic blunder, many prominent Democrats called for the party to move to the middle to appeal to Independents and blue collar workers. Now, some moderates, like Sen. Manchin, maintain the Democratic Party has already lost working class voters. He fears the hard pivot left from several in the party is only further alienating those crucial voters who have been the backbone of the party for decades.

“Hell, in West Virginia they left us anyway. The national Democratic Party doesn’t have a working person in West Virginia voting for them — that I know of, or not many. It’s a shame,” a visibly frustrated Manchin said. “They get them back by doing common sense things, not the crazy stuff they’re throwing out where everybody wants to go as far as they can to the left.”

But Democrats from those states say the tides have turned since Clinton’s shocking loss, partly because of the Trump administration and Republicans’ methodical attempts to undo the Affordable Care Act (ACA), whether through court challenges or repealing the individual health insurance mandate, the required tax penalty against people without health coverage.

That shift in thinking on the ACA, coupled with Democrats success in recapturing control of the House in November, has left supporters of the new Medicare for All proposal feeling like they now have a winning issue. But they know they still need to work on connecting the legislation to people’s current struggles by pointing to issues like soaring premiums, expensive deductibles, and high drug costs.

“I think we’ve got to talk about it correctly,” Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, from Michigan, told VICE News after the press conference rolling out the proposal. “They’re trying to label it, and we need to talk about what it means to working men and women.”

Other Democrats agree the party needs to unify its messaging on health care soon, otherwise Trump will be able to win that battle in crucial states on an issue that’s essential to all Americans. But they’re not too happy the party’s loudest — or at least most publicized — voices on the topic are those Democrats calling for the most revolutionary changes to America’s health care system.

Still, Democrats want to find common ground as a party on how to merge the desire for universal health coverage with calls for the federal government to pick up the tab for that pricey bill.

“I don’t want to be critical, but I think we can do a better job,” Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, from Montana, told VICE News at the Capitol. “We’ve got to have a plan, and I’m not sure we’ve got one right now.”

In the last two elections, the contest for Nigeria’s presidency has felt like it’s been split into two different races.

While the country’s two dominant parties—the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)—have won a vast majority of the votes, the country’s several other parties largely scrap to finish third. As Quartz Africa has reported, the dominance of two major parties makes the chance of a “third party” candidate winning the vote very slim.

Yet, even the race of the underdogs threw up a surprise this year with a little-known US-based pastor, Nicholas Felix of the People’s Coalition Party (PCP), finishing third behind the top two parties. The 37-year old pastor is originally from Edo state in southern Nigeria and holds a doctorate degree in divinity from CICA International University and Seminary in New York. He had little political experience when moved to the United States after winning a US visa lottery in 2003 and now leads New York-based church, Miracle Center International.

Felix’s win is both surprising and embarrassing for the much higher profile candidacies of other “third party” aspirants, including Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of Nigeria’s central bank, Fela Durotoye, a popular motivational speaker and coach and Yele Sowore, activist and publisher of Sahara Reporters. None of them finished in the top seven positions.

For his part, Felix has described his unexpected third place finish as sign of “a progressive adjustment in paradigm” in Nigerian politics.

But most political analysts have a much more plausible theory: voters might have made a mistake.

Given that ballot papers for presidential elections in Nigeria list all the parties fielding candidates (73 in this case) in alphabetical order, Felix’s PCP party was placed just above the leading opposition party PDP (People’s Democratic Party), led by former vice president Atiku Abubakar. Further, the colors of PCP’s party logo are exactly the same as the PDP’s. And with party logos, rather than candidate photos or names listed on the ballot paper, PCP’s conspicuous placement and colors are likely to have been a big factor.

On the right is the opposition PDP logo, whose candidate Atiku came 2nd (we're told..) On the left is the PCP logo of 3rd place candidate and relative outsider, Nicholas Felix.

But regardless of how his votes came about, Felix’s “victory” is Pyrrhic, as the elections were the latest reminder of just how much work third party candidates need to do to match the two major parties. One often suggested way to try to do that is for third party candidates to pool resources and form a coalition. It’s a move that has borne some success in the past: the ruling APC was itself formed after a merger of four independent political parties two years before it won the 2015 presidential elections.",How a little known New York pastor won the third highest votes in Nigeria’s election,Quartz on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/how-a-little-known-new-york-pastor-won-the-third-highest-votes-in-nigeria-e2-80-99s-election/ar-BBUgogj

When Manchin-Toomey seemed briefly poised for a revival last year, some advocates of stricter gun laws backed away from it. Among Democrats ...","While the bill faces an uphill climb in the Senate, it underscores the evolution of gun control in Washington since its heyday in the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton signed a ban on assault weapons and a background check law that only applied to federally licensed dealers. Back then, many rural and Southern Democrats voted against both measures, and the party went on to pay a stiff price at the ballot box. Today, however, Democrats appear emboldened – and unified.

With support from moderate Democrats like Representative Spanberger, the House this week passed the first significant gun control measure in more than two decades, extending required background checks to gun shows and the internet – closing the “gun-show loophole.”

Newly elected Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) of Virginia used to carry a gun every day. A former law enforcement officer – and the first Democrat to represent her district in nearly 50 years – she says not all of her constituents agree with her support for universal background checks for gun purchases. But many do. “This is ensuring that that same standard, not a shifting standard, is applied to all firearms purchases,” she says.

When the House passed a universal background check bill for guns on Wednesday, newly empowered Democrats broke into applause. Cheers and whistles ricocheted through the chamber, and guests in the visitors’ gallery shouted “thank you!”

The outburst prompted the speaker pro tempore to read a warning that any manifestation of approval or disapproval is a violation of House rules – though in an aside, she admitted “that hurt my heart to say that.”

The emotional eruption was understandable. For the first time in more than two decades, the House has passed significant legislation regulating the purchase of firearms by extending required background checks to gun shows and the internet – closing the “gun-show loophole.” It was a bipartisan bill, but largely a party-line vote, with only eight Republicans backing it and two Democrats defecting.

On Thursday, the House also voted to extend the review period for background checks.

The bills’ passage underscores the evolution of gun control in Washington since its heyday in the early 1990s. That’s when President Bill Clinton signed a ban on assault weapons and a background check measure that only applied to federally licensed dealers. Many rural and Southern Democrats voted against both measures, and the party paid a stiff price at the ballot box, with Republicans seizing control of Congress in 1994. Even after Democrats regained the majority in 2006, they shied away from pressing for new gun control measures.

Today, however, Democrats are emboldened – and unified, moving with public opinion.

The drumbeat of periodic mass shootings, overwhelming public support for expanded background checks, and revved-up activism by voters and organizations, all factor into the Democratic consensus on this issue. Their retaking of the House has given them the power to act on that consensus – as does their current geographic makeup.

“Compared with the 1990s or even the early 2000s, House Democrats today are far less dependent on districts with large numbers of culturally conservative blue-collar and rural voters,” notes Ronald Brownstein, senior political analyst for CNN. Instead, he writes, they’re centered on urban and suburban districts supportive of more gun regulation. In essence, the congressional electoral map aligns neatly with the gun-regulation agenda.

But the realigning of Democrats into an urban-suburban party and Republicans into a largely rural party appears to be working against expanded gun regulation in the Republican-controlled Senate – at least for now.

While public opinion heavily favors expanded background checks – even 79 percent of Republicans support it, according to Pew Research Center – GOP lawmakers do not plan to bring up the House bills in the Senate, and Trump has said he’d veto them.

“I think the Senate has spoken on that issue,” says Sen. John Thune (R) of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber. He pointed to a year ago, when, in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, the Senate chose to strengthen the existing background check system and increase resources for school safety. Gun control advocates called those measures “baby steps.”

The closest the Senate came to passing major legislation on expanding background checks was the Manchin-Toomey bill of 2013, named for its bipartisan co-sponsors, Sens. Joe Manchin (D) of West Virginia and Pat Toomey (R) of Pennsylvania. The bill emerged from the outcry over the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

But even under a Senate controlled by Democrats, it failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster, falling six votes short. The National Rifle Association opposed the bill, and four Democrats from rural states with strong gun cultures voted against it. Today’s Senate is now in Republican hands, with fewer moderates.

“The NRA doesn’t have the influence it once did, but their mantra of ‘never give an inch’ is so ingrained in the GOP’s psyche that they are afraid of passing gun control legislation that has broad support and is good common sense,” says Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report in an email.

Senator Toomey says he’s “actively speaking with colleagues” to see what it would take to get to 60 votes on something similar to Manchin-Toomey, but admits “progress is very limited.” Senator Manchin is also pessimistic. “We haven’t had any more buy-in from our Republican colleagues at all.”

It’s also unclear whether some of the Senate’s more liberal Democrats – especially those running for president – would even sign on to their bill, which is more conservative than the House measure. The party has moved left on health care (“Medicare for All”) and the environment (“Green New Deal”). When Manchin-Toomey seemed briefly poised for a revival last year, some advocates of stricter gun laws backed away from it.

Among Democrats, this leaves 2020 as the great hope for gun regulation to actually become law. While it's an uphill climb, Democrats are hoping for a Senate takeover, with Republicans having far more seats to defend. And then there’s the presidency up for grabs.

“This is a step in the right direction,” says Kara Chine, an activist from San Diego who came to the House this week in support of expanded background checks. “It’s getting the American people’s voice heard, since the majority of Americans support this. I feel like every vote is more evidence brought forth.”","As party shifts left, Democrats show new unity on guns",The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0228/As-party-shifts-left-Democrats-show-new-unity-on-guns

(Photo: Provided)

The race for the state Supreme Court is nonpartisan, but the two candidates might as well stitch a D or R on their judicial robes.

Just look.

On the left, appeals court Judge Lisa Neubauer has ties to the Democratic Party that run both long and deep.

She used to work for Democratic politicians, her husband ran the state party for four years and her daughter is a Dem lawmaker.

Neubauer has given more than $27,000 to state and federal liberal and Democratic candidates and groups over the years (though she quit making political donations in 2007). She and her husband were early financial supporters of Barack Obama.

She was appointed to the bench by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. Her current campaign is backed by all the major labor unions and run by Dem operatives.

On the conservative side, appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn's partisan ties can be summed up in two words: Scott Walker.

Hagedorn served as Walker's chief legal counsel for four years — leading the legal fight on Act 10 — and was named to the appellate bench by the Republican governor in 2015.

Hagedorn once belonged to the Kenosha County Republican Party, and his father runs the Milwaukee County GOP. His campaign's primary strategist is a former Walker campaign manager.

If you want to see Hagedorn in action, buy a ticket to this Sunday's Dane County Republican Party's Lincoln-Reagan Day dinner in Madison.

For those who prefer Neubauer, she will be available at a Waukesha County Democratic Meet & Greet at the Casablanca in Brookfield on May 10.

Not that you would realize any this from listening to the candidates.

""There is no place for partisan politics on the Wisconsin Supreme Court,"" Hagedorn wrote in an October column on Right Wisconsin, a largely GOP platform created by former right-wing talk show host Charlie Sykes.

In truth, partisan politics now dominate these races with control of the Supreme Court at stake.

Hagedorn's campaign tries to argue that his opponent is the more partisan of the two.

Neubauer's deep Democratic ties

Some of Neubauer's strong Democratic ties were hashed out in her 2008 race against another liberal candidate for the appeals court.

Neubauer was an aide to longtime Democratic Sen. Fred Risser of Madison and was an assistant Midwest coordinator for Gary Hart's 1984 presidential campaign.

Her husband was a Democratic lawmaker for four terms, state chairman for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 and a member of a Democratic National Committee.

Combined, Neubauer and her husband have given $105,000 to liberal and Democratic candidates and causes. Neubauer herself had given $8,800 to Doyle, the governor who appointed her to the bench.

In the current contest, she has the backing of many liberal groups, including the Wisconsin Education Association Council. (For the full list of labor unions supporting her, go to the state Republican Party website.)

Her daughter Greta Neubauer is now a Democratic member of the state Assembly.

""For Lisa Neubauer, Democratic politics is the family business,"" said Stephan Thompson, a campaign aide to Hagedorn. ""With over $100,000 in donations to left-wing candidates (and groups) helping pave the way to power and influence, there’s no questioning Neubauer’s allegiances.""

Conservatives didn't always see her that way.

In 2008, Rick Esenberg, head of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, endorsed Neubauer, with whom he had previously worked at the Foley & Lardner law firm.

""Lisa is a Democrat, but she is not a rabidly political person,"" Esenberg wrote. ""Back in the day, when a group of us wanted to discuss politics, she would generally beg off or change the subject.""

He added: ""Her politics may be moderately liberal, but she is not a bomb thrower. Quite frankly, no one who is could stay at Foley & Lardner for 19 years representing business.""

Michael Grebe, the onetime Republican National Committee general counsel, also served as a reference when she was appointed to the appellate court bench.

All of that has changed this time around.

Grebe, a former managing partner at Foley, has given $1,000 to Hagedorn.

Employees at WILL have also chipped in $2,550 to Hagedorn's cause, and the Milwaukee nonprofit's new fundraiser, Mary Stitt, was recently paid $3,600 for having done fundraising work for his campaign.

Esenberg said a lot has changed in the past 11 years. He noted that his group isn't officially backing anyone but he is supporting Hagedorn personally.

""Judicial philosophy matters more in Supreme Court races because it has the final word on unresolved questions,"" Esenberg wrote in an email. ""In the prior race, one candidate was pretending to be a judicial conservative. Here, it seems clear that Judge Hagedorn is the originalist candidate.""

Hagedorn's GOP background

Hagedorn has also been an active Republican in the past.

On his 2015 application for a judicial appointment, Hagedorn said he was a member of the Kenosha County Republican Party from 2005 to 2009. He was also the county co-chairman of GOP presidential candidate John McCain in 2008.

At the same time, he ran a blog called ""Anno Domini"" in which he left no doubt about his political persuasion.

""We’re close, very close to a complete Republican takeover of government,” Hagedorn wrote on ""Anno Domini"" in February 2006. “We have not been able to pass our agenda in part because we do not have enough power.”

Appointed chief legal counsel to Walker in 2011, Hagedorn has said he had a role in drafting Act 10, Walker's signature bill curbing collective bargaining for public employee unions, and the hiring and managing of outside counsel in defense of the measure.

In a Trinity College magazine article naming him ""alumnus of the year,"" Hagedorn described his work on Act 10 as his most significant and satisfying. He also helped defend Walker's voter ID legislation and the state's same-sex marriage laws.

While Walker's top state attorney, Hagedorn sent out a personal email in support of then-Supreme Court Justice David Prosser, saying his defeat could embolden union bosses and stop Walker's agenda ""in its tracks.""

In the current race, Hagedorn has the support of big-time GOP supporters such as Richard Uihlein and has turned to pro-Republican media outlets to push back on suggestions that he has anti-gay statements and associations in his past.

Hagedorn once wrote that a Supreme Court decision striking down an anti-sodomy law could lead to the legalization of bestiality. He also helped launch an evangelical Christian grade school that barred gay teachers and students.

Hagedorn is nowhere near as big a campaign donor as Neubauer and her family. But he has made four small donations to local GOP parties, totaling $110, in the past two years. His campaign said these were the costs for attending local party events.

""The voters will need to determine whether Brian Hagedorn can be fair and impartial given his time serving as Scott Walker's lawyer and his partisan and extreme statements and writings,"" said Tyler Hendricks, campaign manager for Neubauer.

No doubt, voters will figure it out for themselves in the end.

The Democratic Party has now, for all intents and purposes, put its entire weight behind marijuana reform.","Marijuana News Today

The marijuana news today should have marijuana investors everywhere celebrating as most of the major Democratic nominees for president have come out in support of a U.S. marijuana legalization bill that was reintroduced yesterday afternoon.

The Marijuana Justice Act would remove marijuana as a Schedule 1 narcotic and expunge federal convictions related to pot.

While the deal stops short of full U.S. recreational marijuana legalization, it’s clear for all to see that this would be a huge step toward that goal. It was introduced before, in 2017, but did not receive a vote.

At the head of the push is Senator Cory Booker, who is among the front-runners for the presidential nominee to go up against Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

In a press release announcing the legislation, Booker said:

Advertisement



The War on Drugs has not been a war on drugs, it’s been a war on people, and disproportionately people of color and low-income individuals…The Marijuana Justice Act seeks to reverse decades of this unfair, unjust, and failed policy by removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances and making it legal at the federal level.

(Source: “Cory Booker introduces bill to legalize marijuana nationwide,” The Hill, February 28, 2019.)

Being removed from Schedule 1 would open the door for medical marijuana to flourish in the United States.

As it stands now, being a Schedule 1 drug defines marijuana as having no medical purpose. It was part of the reason that “Epidiolex,” the first-ever cannabis-derived drug, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); it was a refutation of marijuana having no health benefits.

Of course, they were able to square that circle by putting heavy restrictions on tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels, thereby allowing a cannabis-derived drug to both disprove their assertion that it has no medical benefit while also keeping marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug.

In any case, this is a huge move by the Democrats and draws a clear line in the sand: the Democratic Party is now officially for marijuana reform, full stop.

All the major names running for president have co-sponsored the bill, including Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Senator Kamala Harris.

What this means is that the Democratic Party is (finally) taking a page out of the Liberal Party of Canada’s playbook when Justin Trudeau used marijuana legalization as a key pillar in his campaign that eventually led to his electoral victory.

Again, they’re not promising marijuana legalization, but it’s easy to see which way the wind is blowing. The logical next step would be to see legislation to legalize pot in America.

The next question is whether the bill can gain widespread support. I doubt there are enough House and Senate Republicans willing to join the bill for it to pass—and even some Democrats may chafe at the idea of marijuana legalization.

But symbolically, this is a big first step toward legalization.

Not to mention that if any of these candidates win, expect them to carry their pro-marijuana agendas to the White House. Should they gain control of the Senate and House in the upcoming elections, we’ll likely see U.S. marijuana legalization sooner rather than later, which would create exponential growth in the pot stock market.

CGC Stock

While not quite as important as the political marijuana news today, Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE:CGC) continues to make headlines, even while the pot stock market has remained pancake flat to start the day.

CGC stock saw little change in early-morning trading today, but it did manage a near-six-percent gain over the past five days.

While it didn’t serve to push Canopy Growth stock any higher, the company did make headlines when it added domestic guru Martha Stewart to the team. (Source: “Martha Stewart joins Canadian marijuana grower as adviser,” The Guardian, February 28, 2019.)

Stewart is serving as an advisor on a new line of cannabis products for both humans and animals. So long as Stewart stays away from the stock side of Canopy Growth, this partnership should work out nicely.

Jokes aside, this is a win for CGC stock. After all, branding is going to be hugely important as sales become an increasingly prominent factor in pot stock performances.

Stewart brings with her a whole brand unto herself that will likely lend credibility to these products in the eyes of her many fans.

It also helps normalize marijuana as a product. After all, if America’s domesticity expert comes along and approves of pot, how bad could it really be?

Canopy Growth stock will more directly benefit from the sales boost that Stewart-supported products could yield.

The first new line of products is said to be targeting pets and could open another untapped market.

As usual, I’m bullish on CGC stock, with the Martha Stewart addition being another strong move—if, perhaps, not the most momentous.

TLRY Stock

A far more impactful move in the marijuana news today came by way of Tilray Inc (NASDAQ:TLRY) as it inked its deal to acquire FHF Holdings Ltd. (Manitoba Harvest).

Manitoba Harvest is the world’s largest hemp food manufacturer and produces a number of cannabis-related goods. (Source: “Tilray Closes Transaction Acquiring Manitoba Harvest, the World’s Largest Hemp Foods Company,” Business Wire, February 28, 2019.)



TLRY stock, like many pot stocks today, saw little movement in early-morning trading, but does find itself up two percent over the past five days.

While the deal was announced several weeks ago, its finalization is a big step for the company and signals the growing interest over hemp products—especially now that hemp offers the best avenue to enter the U.S. marijuana market.

While the winds of change are blowing and we’re likely to see U.S. marijuana legalization sooner rather than later, “sooner” in this case still means a couple of years, minimum. It’s more likely three to five.

But hemp is officially legal across all 50 U.S. states and D.C. Canopy Growth has signaled its interest in the market, and so has several other pot stocks. The acquisition of Manitoba Harvest puts Tilray stock right in that conversation.

I still have a few reservations about TLRY stock, but ultimately, it does appear that Tilray stock is set for higher gains in 2019—especially if it enters the U.S. hemp market in force.

CGC and TLRY Stock Performances

Analyst Take

The marijuana news today was a great success for the future of pot stocks.

The Democratic Party has now, for all intents and purposes, put its entire weight behind marijuana reform.

If any of these presidential hopefuls who supported the bill find themselves in the Oval Office by 2021, we’re likely to see a huge push for pot reform, maybe even legalization in as little as two years.

If you look at the three-year run-up to marijuana legalization in Canada, pot stocks grew exponentially, with many gaining as high as 1,000% in that time. The same could happen again should marijuana become legal in the U.S.

He fits easily into the urban liberal section of the Democratic Party, supporting gun control and abortion rights, opposing the death penalty, the Trump tax cuts, Trump’s immigration policies ...","Assessing Jay Inslee’s chance of being the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, let alone winning the White House in 2020, is an exercise in pure speculation.

But then, everything about the 2020 presidential race is speculation this point.

Inslee made his run for presidential official in a YouTube video posted on Friday.

It is possible to compare Inslee’s pluses and minuses as a candidate against those of the other announced and potential candidates, and conclude that he starts the race somewhere in the middle of the pack – considerably less known than the front.

On the plus side, he is currently the only governor in the race. The Democratic primary race is awash in United States senators, none of whom were previously a governor, although some have executive exprerience. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was the mayor of a large city, Newark; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was the mayor of a smaller city, Burlington. California Sen. Kamala Harris was a state attorney general. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown – still weighing a presidential run – was secretary of state.

Before being elected to Congress, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was a member of the Obama administration. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was an attorney in private practice.

Washington has elected Democrats as governor in the last nine elections, and gone for the Democratic nominee in the last eight. Inslee could presumably carry his home state in 2020, but Washington is a medium-sized state, with only 12 Electoral College votes; it is not one of the elector-rich states like California, New York, Texas or Florida.

It is a state with the largest percentage of jobs tied to international trade, a growing metropolis with strong technology and aviation sectors, and varied agricultural and natural resource sectors that include wheat, apples, grapes and timber.

But it also a politically divided state, and while Inslee won his last election with 54 percent of the vote, he lost all counties east of the Cascades, and some western counties that don’t touch Puget Sound, to a relatively unknown and underfunded Republican challenger, Bill Bryant. Donald Trump won most of those same counties.

Like any governor, Inslee has had successes and failures while in office. The state has climbed out of the recession that had forced it to cut back on schools, colleges and social programs, and as tax revenue has grown, so has the spending to improve those programs.

Some of of those improvements were forced by the courts: the Washington Supreme Court ordered the state to improve its public schools the year before he was elected; it took Inslee and the Legislature until 2017 to come up with a way to meet that mandate, which had to be revised last year and is likely to be revised again this year. Despite more spending, aspects of the state’s mental health facilities still struggle under a court order to improve.

The state Department of Corrections has had problems with properly timing the release of its inmates, from a computer problem that predated Inslee’s tenure and he says he ordered fixed as soon as it came to his attention. But Republicans point out it was ignored by his appointees and the people who reported to them. One of the inmates released early committed a murder during the time when he still should have been in prison; another committed a vehicular homicide.

Recent reporting by the Seattle Times revealed the department continues to have problems calculating the correct time when an inmate’s sentence has been served.

Inslee’s signature issue is the fight against climate change. The state has adopted programs to clean up its waterways, boost salmon and increase the number of electric vehicles, but one of Inslee’s key goals, reducing carbon emissions through a tax, a fee or a cap-and-trade system, have failed either in the Legislature or at the ballot box.

He has another ambitious carbon reduction plan in this year’s Legislature – cut fossil fuel use in energy production, protect threatened orcas, increase salmon runs, reduce auto emissions, clean up toxins around the Puget Sound – which doesn’t rely on a carbon tax. Instead, it would get money from a capital gains tax on investors with more than $25,000 in gains and a change in the business and occupation tax.

It will compete with other tax plans from his party in the Legislature, and the demand from Republicans to hold the line on spending to no more than the rising revenue the economy is producing.

Among presidential contenders, Inslee has the best credentials on climate change, and likely the greatest depth on the effects and possible solutions. He can talk at length about stressed shellfish beds from ocean acidification, the effects of catastrophic wildfires Washington has experienced in recent years and declining numbers of orcas and salmon. He has formed coalitions with other governors who say that their states will abide by the Paris Climate Accord even though Trump has pulled the United States out.

One problem for Inslee’s concentration on climate change would be if he is pegged as a single-issue candidate, even with an issue like climate change which touches a vast spectrum of problems. He fits easily into the urban liberal section of the Democratic Party, supporting gun control and abortion rights, opposing the death penalty, the Trump tax cuts, Trump’s immigration policies, including the border wall – and possibly anything related to Trump.

He first caught the attention of some national pundits for a White House meeting between the president and the nation’s governors, arguing with Trump in early 2018 about the wisdom of arming teachers to protect students from mass shootings, and urging “a little less tweeting and a little more listening”.

While candidates who are members of Congress have a soapbox in their day jobs to complain about decisions by the Trump Administration, a governor has a platform to contest them, and at almost every turn Inslee and Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson have.

Washington was the first state to challenge the original Muslim ban, winning a quick victory in U.S. District Court in Seattle about two weeks after Trump was inaugurated. Appeals courts upheld that ruling, although the Trump administration eventually won a 5-4 ruling on its second revised ban in the Supreme Court.

It has pushed back on possible changes in federal prosecution of marijuana in states like Washington that have legalized the drug, loosening of some environmental controls, the ban on military service transgender, immigration policies, net neutrality, changes to the Affordable Care Act and, most recently, on restrictions on family planning clinics from mentioning abortion as an option.

While he’s not unique among Democrats for vocal criticism of the president, Inslee has practiced a large supply of jabs and one-liners in the state and in smaller settings that he will be taking on the road to a national audience. They’ll be intermixed with various sports analogies appropriate to that particular season, as Inslee, a high school athlete, is a vocal fan of almost any team playing in Washington state.",Jay Inslee is running for president.

The Granite State Poll’s results were released on Thursday and show the Vermont senator had the most support out of the Democrats who have announced themselves as 2020 candidates or are expected to do so.

Sanders received 26 percent of the participants’ support in February while the former vice president had 22 percent. Sanders announced his ambitions for the presidential race on Feb. 19 and said he plans to champion the ideals he had during his 2016 presidential run.

However, Biden has not formally announced a run for presidency. Sources have said he’s spoken with longtime supporters about whether or not the 76-year-old is too old for the position.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had seven percent of the participants’ support, according to the Granite State Poll.

When asked which candidate they wouldn’t support under any circumstances, Warren took the lead. About 13 percent of participants said they would not support the Massachusetts senator. Sanders followed in second, with 8 percent.

The poll shows Sanders was considered the second most likable candidate, after Biden. Meanwhile, Warren came in sixth place in that category.

Nearly half of the Democratic primary voters who participated in the survey believe Sanders is the most progressive candidate in the party. Warren trailed behind with 10 percent of voters believing she’s most progressive.

Among the three announced Republican candidates, 68 percent of GOP voters in the survey would vote for President Donald Trump.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld holds 3 percent of the participants’ support. However, 57 percent of Republican voters are still trying to decide who they will cast their ballot for.

Weld announced on Feb. 15 he formed a presidential exploratory committee.

UNH said 604 New Hampshire adults were randomly selected and interviewed via phone call for the survey between Feb. 18 and Feb. 26. The survey was taken by 240 likely 2020 Democratic primary voters and 218 likely Republican primary voters.",University of New Hampshire Poll Shows Sanders Is Favorite for Granite State Democrats,NECN,https://www.necn.com/news/new-england/UNH-Survey-Shows-Sanders-is-Favorite-for-NH-Democratic-Voters-506553121.html

Inslee was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2018, and New Hampshire Democrats felt he did not direct enough support to their ...","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday became the latest Democrat to launch a 2020 presidential bid, asserting in a video he is the only candidate who will make combating climate change the country's top priority.

""We're the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we're the last who can do something about it,"" Inslee says in the video. ""We went to the moon, and created technologies that have changed the world. Our country's next mission must be to rise up to the most urgent challenge of our time -- defeating climate change.""

Inslee, 68, is the first governor to enter the Democratic contest and has the longest political resume of anyone in the race.

In 1992, after two terms as a state legislator, he was elected to represent a largely rural, Republican-leaning congressional district in central Washington. In Congress, Inslee attracted national attention by voting for the 1994 assault weapons ban, immediately making him a target for the GOP.

""People are fed up with crime and want something done to protect them and their children from violence,"" Inslee told reporters at the time, standing by his vote.

Inslee lost in that year's Republican wave, but he mounted a comeback in a neighboring district four years later. One of the most potent attack ads run against him had portrayed a fictional call from Bill Clinton, thanking Inslee for being so loyal; in 1998, Inslee ran his own version of that ad, with a Newt Gingrich impersonator thanking the Republican incumbent for helping him impeach the president.

Back in Congress, Inslee was a reliable liberal vote and a member of the center-left New Democrats. He focused most on climate and environmental issues; in 2007 he published ""Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy,"" a book about ways to transition the country from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy.

He also kept one eye on Washington, running for governor in 2012 and winning a narrow victory over a popular Republican attorney general. Inslee spent his first term presiding over a divided state government, cutting budget deals with a Republican state Senate and instating a moratorium on the state's death penalty.

Inslee was comfortably reelected in 2016 and joined the loud resistance to President Donald Trump, bringing the state into lawsuits to stop a ban on refugees and immigrants from some Muslim-majority countries. But Inslee's time in Olympia entered a new phase in 2018, after a special Senate race gave Democrats full control of the state government.

""It will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country,"" Inslee told the New York Times on the eve of that election.

The governor made good on that bravado, reviving a number of ambitious bills that Republicans had blocked and capping it all with a carbon tax.

""I have the unique ability to show the proof in the pudding that we've actually done this,"" Inslee told the Atlantic.

Inslee will have to overcome a few major hurdles as he begins his run. Despite spending more than two decades in elected office in Washington state, he lacks the national name recognition of several of his would-be opponents.

And despite his calls for drastic action to combat climate change, Inslee's most ambitious climate change initiative -- the institution of a tax on carbon emissions -- was voted down in the state's elections last November, thanks in part to massive opposition spending from oil companies. In response, Inslee introduced a new batch of legislation, which he calls ""a clean energy smart deal,"" that he believes would stop the state's utilities from relying on fossil fuel power by 2045.

Inslee would also have to overcome some tension within his own party in one of the earliest voting states. Inslee was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2018, and New Hampshire Democrats felt he did not direct enough support to their candidate, Molly Kelly, who lost to incumbent Republican Chris Sununu. In an interview with a local radio station, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said Inslee ""abandoned"" New Hampshire in the 2018 election.

During the 12 years of civil war, the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (FMLN) managed to build and maintain the unity of five allied politico-military parties and various civil-political parties and movements of the Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR). This formation was a cauldron of ideas – as much those disputed as those agreed – of actions by all united and specific to the different elements. The FMLN-FDR caught the attention of the entire world. It challenged the government of the United States in massive demonstrations in the front yard of its own capital building. It convinced the state of Mexico and the social democratic forces of Europe to oppose the strategy of Ronald Reagan in Central America and support a negotiated solution. In November of 1989 it managed to carry its offensive “Febe Elizabeth Lives” to the limit and oblige the right of the death squads truly to negotiate and dismantle its structures of repression. Popular unity was seen in the streets. The strength of the resistance was felt. A mystique of solidarity was alive. But the social transformation proposed by the same revolutionary movement was postponed, waiting on a new victory of the same party, the FMLN, transformed into a legal party and dedicated to win power by the electoral road not the military. Shortly after the signing of the peace accords in 1992, the “Broad Front” started to deteriorate. Two of the five founding parties of the FMLN were left outside the Political Commission of the new re-founded party and pulled out to launch their own party – an initiative which came to nothing more than the dispersion of its social base. Various purges of the membership of the new FMLN followed – eliminating those not loyal to a leadership more and more concentrated and monopolized by two elements of the historic party – the Communist Party and the Popular Front for Liberation – the second a son of the first, and both characterized by their verticalism (top-down structure and culture). Little by little, the party substituted itself for the social and labour movements from which it was born and prioritized locating its team in the positions associated with its new quota of power – in the municipalities and the Legislative Assembly.

The “Closed Front” The process of enclosing itself accelerated in 2009 when the new FMLN won the presidency and with that the opportunities to reward its most loyal elements and family members with stable and well-paid jobs. It is true that the Front had to offend its own principles to affiliate the candidate Mauricio Funes at the last moment – Funes, a journalist without a history of militance in the party. But no one complained given that the result was to attract other sectors to the project of “Change” and win the executive power. Not until years later was it understood that that this first president of the republic from the left exposed a vulnerable flank of the party – to be accused of being corrupt like all the others. No one questions the honor of the second president of the republic for the FMLN, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, but unfortunately there are various officials of his administration that have left us doubting that their first duty is to the people. And these were enough for the accusation to stick – for disappointment to flourish. But the factor of “the corrupt” could not explain such a decisive defeat. The FMLN’s candidate in the recent election was left with only 14.4 percent of the vote – far from the result in the presidential elections of 2014 and only half of its vote in the legislative elections of 2015. ARENA and is allies were left with 31.7 per cent – close to its historical record. And so, how to understand that the denouncing of the corrupt did not affect ARENA so much? – with its long and recognized history of mega corruption – including a convicted ex-president. Its that, in the case of ARENA, there was no deception – its base did not expect anything different – its history is known and tolerated.

The Base Which Hoped for More In the case of the FMLN, its base, yes, hoped for more. The FMLN came to the executive power carrying all the aspirations of the revolutionary masses which gave strength to the historic movement, and the administrations of Funes and Sanchez Ceren accepted the charge of accomplishing a good part of that agenda. But, in fact, it was only part, and what yes was accomplished, was sometimes only half done. Veterans who waited for their meagre pensions until just days before the election. The producers of shoes and uniforms for students who waited for payment until the following semester. The sick who confronted long line-ups and shortage of medicines in the hospitals. The thousands of unemployed. The parents who watched their children emigrate. The old who hoped for a decent pension. Clearly the economic conditions did not permit much more. And the lack of a reliable majority in the Legislative Assembly imposed significant limits on the ambitions of the government. It could be said that all this is not the fault of the FMLN – that the neo-liberal hegemony does not permit more that alleviating the desperation of the working class – that the executive power is limited when its own party does not have more strength in the Legislative Assembly. But the excuses did not matter. The FMLN left the people with their illusions – they even fed them by repeating the beloved revolutionary speeches. And so in the end, the people were disappointed and resentful. This is the material which flamed up with the spark of “corrupt like all the rest” and brought the party to loosing the greater part of its historic base.

The New Option – on the Left or the Right The new option which turned out to be the winner in the first round of the recently held presidential elections came out of that same FMLN. Nayib Bukele was the mayor of San Salvador, elected under the leftist flag. He was expelled from the party at the end of 2017 superficially because he offended one of his own counsel members, but after distancing himself from the leadership on various questions. Bukele allied with the GANA party to be nominated as a candidate for the presidency, after the attempt to register his own party – New Ideas – within the time limits failed – and after other parties available for the purpose were blocked by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. GANA is a break-away from ARENA which emerged from a coalition of parties on the right which participated in the presidential elections of 2014 under the “UNITY” banner and supported by the then ex-president for ARENA, today imprisoned for corruption, Antonio Saca. On the basis of this history, the candidate Bukele and his party were painted as a new expression of the right by various left-wing columnists. In fact, the New Ideas party of the president-elect has not defined itself ideologically. It is a party in process of formation with a mixed leadership of various tendencies – the disappointed from all the other parties. Its main line has been to put the finish to corruption and demand “the return of what was robbed” – a line with no echo from the main right-wing party – ARENA – nor even much from the associate party – GANA. And so New Ideas is not just more of the same. It is not right wing. It does not defend impunity. And furthermore, its vote comes in good measure from the left – those who abandoned the FMLN – and only supplemented by GANA. In the legislative elections of 2018, GANA came out with 243,268 votes. If all these voters supported Bukele, they do not represent even one-fifth part of his voter base – 1,434,856. The major part of the base of Bukele voted for the option of the left in 2014.

In 2014, Sanchez Ceren won the presidency in the second round with 1,495,815. In the legislative elections of 2015 the Front came close to their result in 2012, with 847,289 votes and 31 deputies. In the Legislative elections of March 2018, a few months after having expelled Bukele, the FMLN lost almost half of its vote from 2015 and remained with only 437,760 votes and 22 deputies. In the presidential elections of this year 2019, the option on the left did not recover anything. The cold reality is that the Front lost even more votes – another 48,471. More than a million voters who elected a left-wing government in 2014, did not vote for the FMLN in 2019. Given that the party on the right, ARENA, did not loose anything either, it is reasonable to suppose that these 1,106,526 votes for the left in 2014 went to Bukele in 2019. The victory of Bukele is truly the defeat of the FMLN.

The Parties Look to 2021 Two years remain before the new correlation of political forces expresses itself in the Legislative Assembly. In the year 2021, the bi-centenary of the Republic of El Salvador, new legislative elections will be celebrated, presumably with the participation of New Ideas, the party of Bukele. In the meantime, the new government will have to deal with an Assembly dominated by the right and also construct its party, its structure and its socio-political orientation. The first test of its character will be the question of water – to privatize it or to leave it in the hands of the state. Everything that happens in this Assembly will be elaborated with all eyes on the next Assembly. It is difficult to imagine that the coalition of GANA with New Ideas will survive, but again, much depends on their positions on the question of water. If GANA goes with ARENA, it becomes more difficult to avoid the proposal from the right – to manage the system with a council dominated by private business.

In all of this, the role of social and labor movements will be decisive. New Ideas requires a strong fraction in the next Assembly to guarantee its future. The new party cannot disappoint it base from the left, not in the battle against corruption, nor in the defense of social gains, nor in defense of water as a common good of the people. The ARENA party is already into an internal fight for a new leadership. Callejas, their ex-candidate, stays quiet. The other pretenders for that nomination are positioning to take advantage of the opening. Various deputies for ARENA are supporting a proposal from Bukele – to redirect a loan from a new building for the Assembly toward the construction of 50 model schools. But the party maintained its base – it survived the Bukele phenomenon. And so, with its dominant position in the Assembly, the internal fight will not lead to greater trouble. The ARENA party does not have to rebuild itself. The case of the FMLN is otherwise. No one is going to propose a change of program, of ideology, of commitment to the working class. But yes, there will be a purging of the leadership and a renewal of the historic commitments. There are already voices being heard which propose that the defeat and the times require something more. The Political Commision has declared that its current members are not eligible for nomination in the next internal election. And so, there will be a real contest. Oscar Ortiz, vice-president with Sanchez Ceren, and Hugo Martinez, ex-candidate, have proposed to run for General Secretary – and there are others who want to run. The project of recovering its strength in the Legislative Assembly and the Municipalities in 2021 is no easy task. The Bukele phenomenon continues to dominate the political panorama.

The FMLN cannot wait for its base to return disappointed by New Ideas. A transformation is required not only of its structure but also of its culture – building a true internal democracy without verticalism – transparent elections at all levels – a voter/membership register open to all who profess loyalty to the principles of the party and pay the quota. And further, it is time to rebuild the alliances with currents and movements – which facilitate a broad and fluid unity – in solidarity with struggles which emerge in the various sectors and on various issues. The challenge for the FMLN is to demonstrate that it is capable of transforming itself and recuperating, in some way, the mystique of it first chapter. Again, the first test will be the question of water. To defend water, the legislative caucus of the FMLN has no option other than to look for allies amongst the other parties in the Legislative Assembly, including the parties on the right, and with the new President. But in the end it will be the strength of the popular movement of resistance to privatization which determines the result.

Washington (AFP) - Washington state Governor Jay Inslee joined a crowded field on Friday of candidates seeking the Democratic White House nomination, saying he would make climate change the central theme of his campaign.

The 68-year-old Inslee is the first governor of a US state to join the race to take on Republican Donald Trump -- a well-known climate skeptic -- in November 2020.

""Our country's next mission must be to rise up to the most urgent challenge of our time: defeating climate change,"" Inslee said in a video announcing his candidacy.

Inslee, a former member of the US House of Representatives who was elected governor in 2012 and re-elected in 2016, said he is ""the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation's number one priority.""

A national survey carried out last year for Yale and George Mason universities found that increasing numbers of Americans believe global warming is happening.

Seventy-three percent of those polled by Ipsos said they think global warming is occurring, up 10 percentage points from three years earlier.

But there is a big partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans over the issue and Trump -- who withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord shortly after taking office -- rarely misses a chance to voice his skepticism.

When Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar announced recently that she was seeking the Democratic nomination, Trump mocked her on Twitter for ""talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.""

With much of the country gripped by a cold spell in January, Trump tweeted ""wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!""

Inslee, a native of Seattle, home to Amazon and Microsoft, compared the fight against climate change to the 1960s challenge of president John F. Kennedy to send a man to the moon.

""We're the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we're the last that can do something about it,"" he said. ""We went to the moon and created technologies that have changed the world.

""This crisis isn't just a chart or a graph anymore,"" he said. ""The impacts are being felt everywhere.""

- Crowded field -

Other Democratic candidates for the White House have emphasized climate change in their platforms but Inslee is the only one so far to make it the main theme of his campaign.

All six US Democratic senators who are vying for the nomination received a perfect score last year from the League of Conservation Voters when it came to voting on environmental issues, The Washington Post reported.

Like the six senators, Inslee has also voiced support for the ""Green New Deal,"" a plan introduced by Democrats in Congress to combat climate change while stimulating the economy.

Inslee has been an outspoken critic of Trump, joining the governors of other Democratic-controlled US states in lawsuits challenging some of the president's policies such as his travel ban on immigrants from mainly Muslim nations.

A liberal Democrat, Inslee is popular in his northwestern state but he does not yet have the national profile of some of the other White House hopefuls in the large and diverse Democratic field.

Among those who have announced bids to become the Democratic nominee are US senators Bernie Sanders, 77, Kamala Harris, 54, Elizabeth Warren, 69, Cory Booker, 49, Amy Klobuchar, 58, and Kirsten Gillibrand, 52.

Also running are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, 37, of Hawaii, Obama-era housing secretary Julian Castro, 44, of Texas and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, who would be the first openly gay nominee of a major party.

And several other potential candidates are waiting in the wings, including former vice president Joe Biden, 76, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, 46, and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, 66.","Targeting climate change, Washington governor joins Democratic race",YAHOO!,https://www.yahoo.com/news/targeting-climate-change-washington-governor-joins-democratic-race-175902978.html

So it was really like a ...","NEW CANAAN, CT — After digging through a pile of old books stacked behind a display case of glass bottles, each containing items such as coriander seeds, flaxseeds and hemlocks, Michael Murphy found what he was looking for: a visibly aged notebook, which he refers to as a ""day book,"" containing essentially a daily activity log written by employees of the Cody Drug Store. The writing dates back to at least the 1960's, or perhaps even the 1860's.

He then proceeded to look through the drawers behind the case, pulling out various records of items purchased over half a century ago.

""When all this was put in, a lot of this stuff was recut to fit the space,"" Murphy said as he pulled out a drawer.

He pointed out that the top of the wood is clearly a relatively fresh cut, which is noticeable when compared to the surrounding aged wood. (To sign up for New Canaan breaking news alerts and more, click here.)



As the New Canaan Historical Society's Librarian Archivist, Murphy has studied and walked through the drug store many times, which is currently open for the general public to explore. The store itself, however, has been closed since the 1960's.

While not an exact replica, the display gives visitors an idea of what the original store looked like. (Photo credit: RJ Scofield)

To clarify, the Cody Drug Store was New Canaan's first drug store, opened in 1845 by Samuel Silliman and his family under the business' original name, the New Canaan Drug Store. It remained under their operation until 1855, when Lucius Monroe and his family took over.



The business finally became the Cody Drug Store in 1919 when it was passed to James J. Cody, who had worked at the store prior to owning it. The store was a historical fixture in New Canaan, and was located on Main Street until the original building was torn down.

""The Cody's owned it until it was closed in 1965,"" Murphy said, ""and when they closed it they donated the entire interior to the Historical Society.""

To accommodate the artifacts acquired from the drug store, the Historical Society built an extension onto the Town House to display them. Though the museum is obviously much smaller than the original store and is not an exact replica, one cannot help but feel they have stepped into somewhere out of time as they walk along the creaky floor and take in the aroma of aged wood.

Glass bottles that once contained colognes, acids and other items adorn the shelves on the wall, some still containing said items. Glass cases display various items either sold at the store or used by employees, and nearly every cabinet or drawer contains a piece of town history.

""Whenever someone comes in here they're always really surprised that we have all these original bottles and prescriptions,"" Murphy said. ""It's a fantastic record of all the doctors that were in the area, stuff like that.""



While the store sold various odd items, it was also where prescriptions were filled by a pharmacist, something the store was well-known for.

""The sort of offhand story is that the drug store was known in the area as having weird odds and ends for medicine that people from pharmacies in New York City would actually come here to pick up ingredients for their own pharmacies,"" Murphy said, ""They would take it back with them and then sell it at their own stores. So [the store] was fairly well-known.""

""This was one of the main meeting points in New Canaan,"" Murphy said. ""It was the place you would go to that had basically everything you need in one stop. If you needed random odds and ends, you could go to the drug store and they would have it. You'd probably be there picking up your medicine anyway, and then you could window shop.""



Though he often compares it to what would today be a CVS, Murphy admitted it is difficult to think of the drug store's true modern day equivalent.



""James Cody was a Democrat, and he was also the head of the Democratic Party in New Canaan, so the Cody Drug Store served as the unofficial meeting spot for the Democrats. So it was really like a meeting place,"" Murphy said. ""I always tell people who come in that the store was sort of like a CVS, where you can sort of buy everything, but you're not going to CVS to have a meeting, so I don't really know if there is an equivalent.""



Were someone to walk into the store in 1918, Murphy said they would see a ""pretty brisk trade of people"" purchasing items, coming in and out of the store and meeting up with friendly faces, perhaps stopping to have a chat or invite each other to get lunch.

""A lot of candy was sold here, so you would see a lot of kids going through the drawers and stuff,"" Murphy said.

Out of all the items in the store, Murphy kept coming back to the ""day book,"" which reads like a ""who's who"" of New Canaan. While the book can tell its reader what notable town residents or visitors purchased items at the drug store, it can also give them a unique insight into the buying habits and everyday aspects of a person's life, a person they've never met before and may have lived decades before them.

""We have all these old records in here that probably have not been touched since 1965. I've been going through all this stuff to kind of see what was happening,"" Murphy said. ""These are disposable items; not everyone is saving these. The things that are considered disposable now were disposable then, and that makes them rare.""



According to Murphy, many of the records at the store probably have not been touched since 1965. (Photo credit: RJ Scofield)

The Cody Drug Store is open for anyone to view, although Murphy recommends calling ahead. To learn more about the store, visit the New Canaan Historical Society or click here.

These directions include plans to encourage the use of more electric vehicles, implementing the Made-in-NL carbon pricing program, and increasing energy-efficiency in housing units and office buildings.

The report also lays out the need for the province to build climate resilient infrastructure, address health issues that may arise from climate change, increase community and education outreach, and decrease the reliance on diesel electricity generation for communities in the province that are off-grid.

By Jared Jeffery, Political Analyst, NKC African Economics.

On Saturday, February 23, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) chose former President John Mahama to be its flagbearer in the 2020 presidential election.

According to Myjoyonline the party primary election was the most exhaustive the country has seen, with around 225,000 delegates in 275 constituencies casting their ballots.

So while the decision to grant Mr Mahama, who lost against President Nana Akufo-Addo in 2016 (by 44.4% to 53.9%), the opportunity to have another go may not be wise, it was plainly the will of the party. He reportedly received 95% of the votes cast at the primary.

“Tonight, I want to serve notice to Ghana that from the outcome of this election, the NDC is strong,” Mr Mahama reportedly stated after the results were announced, according to AFP. However, his overwhelming victory says exactly the opposite.

The fact that there is nobody within the NDC ranks that could challenge for the flagbearer role speaks either to a lack of talent within the party, or else dominance of it by Mr Mahama and his backers to a degree that does not allow for lively competition. Neither is a sign of strength.

There may, however, be a third reason.

If we look at the issue from the perspective of an ambitious NDC politician, we can perhaps understand why nobody was very keen to challenge for the flagbearer role.

Mr Akufo-Addo has yet to make a significant misstep since taking the reins in early 2017. Indeed, the economy is on a firmer footing, the free schooling programme has been a hit, the new regions have been created, dumsor (interrupted power supply) is seldom an issue, and there have been relatively few corruption scandals to sully his record.

All-in-all he looks like a shoo-in to get another term (incumbents generally have an advantage in any case). A rational NDC presidential hopeful would have good reason to want to wait out 2020 and plan instead for 2024.

The country, however, needs a strong opposition to keep the government in check and thus some healthy competition in 2020 would have been preferable.

The NDC, we believe, has a ‘Mahama problem’. By this we mean that the tainted legacy of the former president continues to hamstring the party because every time it raises an objection against Mr Akufo-Addo or his ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), the latter is able to point to a worse policy or scandal under Mr Mahama.

This legacy has not faded (or been ‘reframed’) significantly over the past two years, and it is not clear that it will be significantly different by the end of next year.

The presidential election is still well over a year away, and a lot can happen before then to change the prospects of either of the main candidates (there will only be two in the running, and now they are known).

With that said, Mr Akufo-Addo will likely be happy that he is coming up against Mr Mahama as it should be a relatively easy race.

With regard to political risk, this should ensure policy continuity and more long-term thinking, but a lack of opposition strength could affect accountability and the fight against corruption.",Op-Ed: 2020 Myopia for Ghana’s opposition party,CNBC Africa,https://www.cnbcafrica.com/news/west-africa/2019/03/01/op-ed-2020-myopia-for-ghanas-opposition-party/

(CNN) -- Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood was a kid in a swimming class when her heart began to race. She was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia, which has since shaped her life in every way, from her preference for caffeine-free diet Coke to her career starting out as a registered nurse.

In 2017, when she saw her Illinois congressman, Republican Randy Hultgren, promise to protect those like her with preexisting conditions, but then later vote for a bill that would have increased their costs to get covered, a heart that sometimes beats too fast also gave her a reason to run for Congress.

Democrats took the House in 2018 by campaigning against the Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, tying personal stories to a larger narrative of protecting the coverage of millions of Americans. The strategy worked for Underwood, who won her exurban Chicago district in an upset.

""A lot of these provisions impact me personally,"" she told CNN last year. ""I still don't know how to tread water.""

Yet while health care propelled the Democrats to success, the issue has already begun to divide the party as its members propose what to do next.

On Wednesday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat and the leader of the Progressive Caucus, and Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan will unveil the most significant single payer proposal in the House yet. It has the support of more than 100 members — many more than support less radical House bills that would permit states to create a Medicaid buy-in option or allow Americans at age 50 to buy into Medicare. It's based off a bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who got other senators running for president — Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker — on board too.

Nevertheless it has split the 235-member House Democratic caucus, and the vast majority of the new freshman class — roughly 75% — has not signed onto the Medicare for All bill.

Some of those who haven't co-sponsored the bill are freshmen Democrats from competitive districts like Underwood, Rep. Donna Shalala, the former Health and Human Services Secretary, and Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who said in interviews that they are focused on fixing the Affordable Care Act and lowering the price of pharmaceuticals rather than a total overhaul of the health care system.

Underwood told CNN that her priority in Congress is to ""stabilize the Affordable Care Act and make sure it's affordable for folks seeking coverage,"" pointing out that there are 37,000 people in her district who use its marketplace.

""I think it's very clear that the American people are looking for lower premium prices, lower prescription drug prices, and higher quality coverage,"" Underwood said. ""There are many routes to achieving those goals.""

When it comes to debating one of those routes — such as a government-run plan — she raises a host of questions.

""How much is it going to cost?"" she asked. ""How are we going to pay for it? Who specifically it covers? What happens with private insurance? What happens to all types of coverage?""",Democrats divided on new Medicare for all bill,Houston Style Magazine,http://stylemagazine.com/news/2019/mar/01/democrats-divided-new-medicare-all-bill/

A diverse group that includes at least six U.S. senators will be vying for the right to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, who could face a long-shot primary challenger.

Here are the Democrats who have either launched campaigns or formed exploratory committees to begin raising money and hiring staff for a presidential run:

CORY BOOKER - Booker, 49, a black second-term senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination. He announced his candidacy on Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month, mentioning the impact of racial discrimination on his family and saying he would focus on creating good jobs and reforming the criminal justice system.

PETE BUTTIGIEG - The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, launched a campaign to become the first openly gay president on Jan. 23 with a call for a new generation of leadership to bring fresh approaches to problems. Buttigieg, 37, brushed off questions about his experience by highlighting the economic turnaround he led in his city.

JULIAN CASTRO - The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama joined the race on Jan. 12 in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. Castro, 44, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, is so far the only Hispanic in the field. He has used his family's personal story to criticize Trump's border policies.

JOHN DELANEY - The former U.S. representative from Maryland was the first Democrat to enter the race in July 2017, long before most candidates began making their moves. Delaney, 55, has focused heavily on campaigning and organizing in Iowa, the state that will kick off the nominating fight in February 2020, making repeated trips there and visiting all 99 of its counties.

TULSI GABBARD - Gabbard, 37, the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, announced she would run on Jan. 11. Her campaign quickly became engulfed in controversy over her past anti-gay activism and statements, and the Hawaii congresswoman was forced to apologize. ""In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong,"" she said.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND - An outspoken leader in the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment, the senator from New York announced her candidacy on Jan. 15 on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" Gillibrand, 52, touted her rural roots in upstate New York on a subsequent trip to Iowa and said she had proven her ability to win over more conservative rural voters.

KAMALA HARRIS - She announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. The daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. The 54-year-old, first-term senator from California reported raising $1.5 million online in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall.

JAY INSLEE - The Washington state governor entered the field on March 1 with a vow to make climate change a central issue. Inslee, 68, has made protecting the environment a key fixture of his administration. He also has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012.

AMY KLOBUCHAR - She was the first moderate in the field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings on his Supreme Court nomination. Now in her third six-year term as a senator for Minnesota, Klobuchar's campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult for her to hire high-level campaign strategists.

BERNIE SANDERS - The Vermont senator, 77, lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hilary Clinton. Sanders previously gained a strong voter turnout from America's youth who supported his proposals for free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare, ideas he plans to reprise as he vies for the 2020 nomination. The campaign reported it raised $10 million in the first week of his run.

ELIZABETH WARREN - The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts, a leader of the party's liberals and fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, jumped into the race with a New Year's Eve video release. On visits to states that hold early nominating contests such as Iowa and New Hampshire, she has focused on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy.

by CHARLES MCKELVEY

On February 24, 2019, the Cuban people overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution, as 84.4% of resident citizens voted in the constitutional referendum, with 86.8 % voting “Yes,” 9% “No,” 2.5% blank ballots, and 1.6% annulled.

Since the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba has been striving to develop a socialist constitutional foundation. The evolving Cuban constitutionality includes: reformulations of liberal bourgeois concepts of political and civil rights, including the development of popular democracy; universal protection of social and economic rights; proclamation of the rights of nations to sovereignty and to control of their natural resources, in opposition to imperialism; and definition of the necessary role of the state in the protection of the rights of the people and the nation. Cuban socialist constitutionality has been developed on a foundation of extensive popular participation. And it has been developed with consciousness of its historic antecedents: The Constitution of Guáimaro of April 10, 1869, which created the Republic of Cuba in Arms; and the Constitution of 1940, an advanced and progressive constitution, not implemented by “democratic” governments and set aside by the Batista dictatorship.

The revolutionary socialist constitutionality was announced on September 2, 1960, when the National General Assembly of the People of Cuba emitted the Declaration of Havana. It affirmed the right of peasants to the land and the rights of the people to a just wage, free education, and medical attention. And it declared full political, civil, and social rights for blacks, indigenous persons, and women. The National General Assembly of the People of Cuba was a mass meeting of one million, constituting 20% of the Cuban adult population. Along with the mass organizations of workers, peasants, students, women, and neighborhoods, the National General Assembly of the People was an early step in the development of “direct democracy.”

The evolving structures of popular democracy were provided a constitutional foundation by the Constitution of 1976, developed through popular consultation and approved in referendum by 95% of the people. The Constitution of 1976 established 169 municipal assemblies, whose delegates are elected by the people in small voting districts, in secret and direct elections involving two or three candidates nominated in neighborhood assemblies by the people, without the participation of political parties. Subsequently, the 169 municipal assemblies elect the deputies of the National Assembly of Popular Power, the highest authority in the nation, responsible for the election of the highest members of the executive and judicial branches of the State. The Constitution of 1976 also assigns a pivotal role to the mass organizations of workers, farmers, women, students, and neighborhoods in the elections conducted by the municipal assemblies and in the legislative committees of the National Assembly. In addition, the Constitution of 1976 establishes the Communist Party of Cuba as highest teaching and moral authority. Unlike political parties in representative democracies, the Party leads through education and example, without administrative and legislative authority, and without electoral functions. Moreover, like the 1960 Declaration of Havana, the Constitution of 1976 affirms the social and economic rights of the people, and it declares the right of Cuba and all nations to sovereignty.

A constitutional reform in 1992, developed on the basis of a popular consultation, declared state ownership over the principal means of production, thus permitting private property, including foreign property, in accordance with a development plan directed by the state. The modification gave constitutional foundation to economic policies made necessary by the collapse of the socialist bloc.

A further constitutional reform in 2002 declared the irrevocable character of Cuban socialism, responding to the Bush Plan to reestablish capitalism in Cuba. The National Assembly of Popular Power approved the constitutional amendment following the signing of its ratification by virtually all citizens.

Based on its belief that the 1976 Constitution no longer corresponds to Cuban reality, the Party proposed the development of a new constitution. The National Assembly of Popular Power appointed a Constitutional Commission, which developed a draft and presented it to the Assembly, which made modifications and approved a draft for presentation to the people. An extensive popular consultation concerning the draft was conducted from August 13 to November 15, 2018. Some 133,680 meetings were held in neighborhoods and places of work and study. There were 8,945,521 participants, with an estimated two million attending more than one, so that the participation rate was approximately three-quarters of the population. There were 1,706,872 commentaries by the people, with 783,174 proposed modifications, additions, or eliminations. On the basis of the opinions and proposals of the people, the Constitutional Commission revised the draft. More than 50% of the proposals of the people were included in the modifications; nearly 60% of the articles were modified in some form. The Commission presented a report to the National Assembly, which further modified the draft and approved it for popular referendum.

The extensive, vibrant, high-quality, and dignified participation in the popular consultation inspired a Cuban daily newspaper to describe the process as “an entire people constructing their constitution,” with a constitutional assembly of the people. Television and newspapers provided extensive coverage, further stimulating popular awareness, engagement, discussion, and debate.

In their 1,706,872 commentaries in 133,680 meetings, the people expressed approval of the socialist revolutionary road that has been in march since January 1, 1959. Some 62% of the interventions included some favorable expression with respect to the unfolding constitutional process. At the same time, there were a scant thirty expressions of rejection of the socialist character of the revolution; and there were only 262 proposals (0.03% of the proposals) that rejected the definition of the Communist Party of Cuba as the guiding force of the nation. On the other hand, there were 4,802 proposals to change the name of the country to the “Socialist Republic of Cuba.” And there were more than 400 proposals for the elimination of private property, constituting an ultra-Left rejection of the direction taken by the Party and the government in 2012.

By far, the theme most addressed by the commentaries was that of marriage. The draft proposed changing the 1976 language defining marriage from a union “between a man and a woman” to a union “between two persons.” Some 24.56% of the proposals addressed the issue, more than twice that of any other; and the theme was raised in 66% of the meetings. Overwhelmingly, the proposals were against the proposed change. On the other hand, the proposed draft’s affirmation of the equal rights of all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, did not provoke controversy.

In accordance with the prevailing sentiments and conviction expressed by the people in the popular consultation, the Cuban Constitution of 2019 continues with principles and structures that have been evolving in Cuba since the revolutionary triumph of 1959. The Preamble of the new Constitution identifies with the historic Cuban struggle against slavery, colonialism, and imperialism for a free, independent, sovereign, and democratic nation, with social justice. It declares that Cuban citizens are determined to carry forward the Revolution that triumphed in 1959, guided by the ideals and the examples of Martí and Fidel as well as the ideas of Marx and Lenin.

The new Constitution affirms the socialist character of the Revolution and the nation. It proclaims that Cuba is a socialist, democratic, and sovereign nation. It proclaims that its socialism and its revolutionary social and political system are irrevocable. As in the Constitution of 1976, the proposed new constitution names the Communist Party of Cuba as the vanguard party that organizes, educates, and leads the people toward the construction of socialism.

The new Constitution conserves the structures of Popular Power that were established by the Constitution of 1976. In addition, it reaffirms the social and economic rights to education, medical attention, housing, and nutrition; and the civil and political rights of due process and freedoms of religion, speech, and assembly. The new constitution, like the Constitution of 1976, declares the duty of the state to protect the environment; and it affirms the principle of gender equality.

Like the Constitution of 1976, the new Constitution affirms the right of Cuba to sovereignty in international relations. It affirms Cuba’s foreign policy principles of sovereignty, anti-imperialism, and self-determination. It recognizes the need for the unity of the Third World in opposition to colonialism, neocolonialism, and imperialism. It reaffirms its commitment to integration and solidarity among the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean.

All revolutions and societies evolve, and the Cuban Revolution has evolved to be more inclusive, including all the people, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or religious belief. Whereas the Constitution of 1976 affirmed the equality of all, regardless race, color, sex or national origin, the new constitution expands the equal protection clause to include sexual orientation, gender identity, religious belief, or disability. This amplification of the equal protection clause of the Constitution is in accordance with international tendencies, and it reflects changes in Cuban society, as it has evolved since 1976.

In recent years, the revolutionary leadership has moved toward embracing the international tendency toward affirmation of gay and transgender rights. However, its orientation has been to educate rather than to impose; it has sought consensus, with the intention of avoiding a conflictive divide among the people. In accordance with the orientation toward consensus, the new Constitution affirms the rights of all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. It removes the traditional definition of marriage, found in the 1976 Constitution, as a union between a man and a woman; but out of respect for the sentiments of the people, the new constitution, as finally modified by the National Assembly, does not define the subjects that enter the marital relation. Instead, it mandates a popular consultation on a new family code, which will provide extended opportunity for further popular debate and popular education. At the same time, the new Constitution requires a final popular referendum on the new family code, ensuring that new laws and regulations, if not accepted by the majority, will not be imposed.

The Cuban Revolution also has evolved to be more inclusive with respect to self-employed persons and small capitalists, thus legitimating a tendency among the people to engage informally in small-scale trading in goods and services. This evolution reflects the need to improve the productive capacity of the nation, in response to a growing popular dissatisfaction with the material standard of living. Responding to this evolving reality, a New Social and Economic Model, modified through an extensive popular consultation, was developed by the Party and approved in 2012 by the National Assembly of Popular Power. In essence, the new model expands self-employment, small-scale private property, cooperatives, and foreign investment, while maintaining state ownership as the principal form of property; it preserves the role of the state as manager and regulator of the economy.

The 2019 Constitution gives constitutional legitimacy to the New Social and Economic Model of 2012. Both the 1976 and the 2019 constitutions declare that the Cuban economy is a socialist economy directed by the State in accordance with its plan for social and economic development. However, the 1976 Constitution recognizes non-state property only as exceptions; and the 1992 Reform does not name non-state forms of property. In contrast, the new Constitution recognizes various forms of property that exist alongside state property, including cooperatives, joint ventures, and private property. However, the new Constitution clearly affirms that the State plays a primary role in formulating and directing a development plan and in regulating the various forms of property.

The overwhelming support for the new constitution in the popular referendum of February 24 constitutes a vote for sovereignty, affirming the right of the nation to decide the characteristics of its political-economic system. It is a vote for democracy, confirming the structures of popular democracy that have been developing since the early 1960s. And it is a vote for continuity, proclaiming that the passing from the political scene of the generation of the revolution only means the continuation by a new generation of the historic Cuban struggle for definitive sovereignty and social justice.Join the debate on FacebookMore articles by:CHARLES MCKELVEY

Senior citizens would be folded into the new Medicare plan, which would ...","Members of the House on Wednesday offered their version of a 'Medicare-for-all' bill that is broader than what's been put forth by Sen. Bernie Sanders(I-Vt.), whose 2016 presidential run pushed the issue into the political mainstream.Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) unveiled the 'Medicare for All Act of 2019,' which redefines what the change in health care coverage might mean. The specifics included in the bill could play a role in the upcoming Democratic presidential primary campaign because candidates seeking support from the party's progressive wing leverage the phrase. But often, they use it to mean various things.Is this bill so different from Medicare-for-all proposals that have come before? And why would those differences matter? Here are the essential takeaways:In terms of the policy 411, the Jayapal-Dingell bill includes provisions not in other proposals.In many ways, the proposal sounds familiar: The government would establish a health plan that pays for basically all forms of medical care for all citizens. That's how it gets the moniker 'Medicare-for-all.'Under this plan, patients would not be responsible for any cost sharing of medical expenses, and the government coverage would include hospitals, doctors, preventive care, prescription meds and dental and vision care. Private insurers would not be allowed to sell plans that compete with the government program.Senior citizens would be folded into the new Medicare plan, which would be more generous than their current coverage, and the government would make sure any medical care they are getting is not disrupted. The bill leaves two other government health care payers intact: the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Service. Beneficiaries enrolled in these programs would have a choice of enrolling in the new Medicare-for-all plan or sticking with their current coverage.Just like the Sanders bill, the House legislation covers what it calls 'comprehensive reproductive health.' Backers say it is meant to cover abortion — a controversial provision. Right now, government-funded health plans are legally prohibited from providing funds for abortions.There are differences, too. For one, the transition to the new Medicare-for-all system would take place over two years, which would be a fast turnaround for a substantial task. Sanders' bill suggested a four-year transition.The biggest difference: This House vision of Medicare-for-all would also cover long-term care. That isn't part of the Sanders bill, and it is not covered by Medicare. But for people with disabilities and the elderly, it's a significant benefit — and one that can get very expensive to pay for out-of-pocket. (The Affordable Care Act included a long-term care provision that was eventually scrapped because of its high cost.)The House bill also would take a swipe at high prices for prescription drugs by empowering the government to negotiate prices directly with manufacturers and to take away and reissue drug patents if such efforts faltered. This idea, known as 'compulsory licensing,' has appeared in drug-pricing bills, but not in other Medicare-for-all legislation.And the bill wades into one of the hottest Medicare-for-all controversies: the role of private health care. Notably, it permits it. Private plans can cover services not included in the single government health plan. Doctors can also refuse to participate in the program and charge patients cash for medical treatment instead.'Whether there's someone out in Beverly Hills who sees the stars and doesn't partake — that would be possible,' said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a doctor and president of Physicians for a National Health Program, a single-payer advocacy group that supports the legislation. 'The way the whole program is structured is to really make it such that that's a very insignificant overall phenomenon.'And the legislation takes on wonkier questions, like health care costs — proposing so-called global budgetsthat set a firm amount the federal government would pay for hospitals, for instance, as a strategy to bring down spending.Still, the legislation leaves a lot of meaningful details open to interpretation.Three big ones: what precisely would be covered, what doctors would be paid and how the program would be financed.Generally, Medicare-for-all would provide 'comprehensive benefits,' accounting for health care needs as 'medically necessary or appropriate.' That means covering hospital and doctor visits, but also, for instance, mental health, maternity services, addiction treatment, pediatrics and medications.Where it gets tricky is determining which specific services qualify as 'necessary.' Sometimes that's obvious — insulin for diabetics or a cast for a broken leg.In other cases, it's not as clear. Examples include politically controversial treatments, like gender confirmation surgery. Many experts do say the procedure is an important option for people with gender dysphoria. But specific components of it are sometimes deemed cosmetic or unneeded — often by those skeptical of the treatment to begin with.There are also reconstructive surgeries that provide medical value, but may be deemed cosmetic.The Department of Health and Human Services would have significant discretion in interpreting what specific services are 'medically necessary.' That means political leanings or scientific debates could sway what's covered, even from administration to administration.'Reasonable people could disagree on certain things,' Gaffney acknowledged.The legislation also spells out steps for determining how to pay doctors — a tricky issue, since doctors often complain that traditional Medicare pays them less than does private insurance. But the bill doesn't set up a reimbursement system.Of course, there's the question of how the U.S. pays for the new program. Studiessuggest Medicare-for-all would bring down national health care costs. Currently, though, much of that health spending is borne by the private sector. Under the Jayapal-Dingell bill, the money would have to come out of taxpayer dollars.That would mean new taxes, and that's a subject that does not appear anywhere in the Jayapal-Dingell bill. (Jayapal has said she will put out a separate list of potential taxes that could finance her single-payer proposal. Sanders also used this strategy — a separate list of 'pay-fors' — to make a case for his bill.)The bill could resonate throughout the 2020 campaign.The House bill keeps a spotlight on the Medicare-for-all issue — requiring Democratic presidential primary candidates to answer more questions and spell out stances on this particular policy.That could create some land mines. Medicare-for-all is controversial, and already major health industry groups have ramped up opposition to the broad idea. This bill's specific provisions, such as its coverage of abortion, would add more adversaries. Its long-term care coverage would further drive up its multitrillion-dollar price tagBut Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, pointed out that addressing concerns such as the long-term care benefit could add to the measure's political muscle. It could make the idea more attractive to older voters, who otherwise might be hesitant to change their coverage but who do turn out disproportionately to vote in primaries.That dynamic, he said, could skew primary results to favor candidates who endorse Medicare-for-all, as opposed to more moderate Democrats who have distanced themselves from the issue. (In a general election, he noted, costs could certainly diminish that support.)'The long-term care piece is unbelievably significant,' he said. 'It surely will help [progressives] with older voters.'",There's A New 'Medicare-For-All' Bill In The House.

Republicans supported a voting system that prints out paper ballots, while Democrats opposed the bill because they want paper ballots that voters could bubble in by pen.



But three lawmakers broke with their parties during Tuesday’s 101-72 vote in the state House. The legislation calls for the state to replace its 17-year-old electronic voting machines with a system that includes a paper ballot.



Democratic state Rep. Valencia Stovall said she voted for the legislation because she believes the touchscreen voting system would help both tech-savvy millennials and seniors who might have a hard time reading and bubbling in ballots.

“I don’t think we should be going back to paper ballots,” said Stovall, who represents Forest Park. “The millennials, they said they’re not going to stand in line and then bubble in their answers. That’s going to deter a lot of people from voting.”

She also supports provisions in House Bill 316 that curtail precinct closures, voter registration cancellations and absentee ballot rejections.

On the other side of the aisle, Republican state Rep. Scot Turner voted against the bill because its touchscreen-and-printer voting system would cost taxpayers about $150 million, and he said hand-marked ballots would be less expensive. Estimates put the up-front cost of hand-marked paper ballots at $30 million to $60 million.



“It was a data-driven decision that we would be wasting $150 million,” said Turner, who represents Holly Springs, about his vote.

He said modern vote-counting machines can catch human errors to ensure paper ballots are counted accurately.

“The scanners that actually would count the ballots are able to compensate for stray marks or double votes or circles or check marks,” Turner said. “Criticisms of hand-marked paper ballots were tainted by an antiquated view of what the old-style Scantrons would allow.”



State Rep. Carl Gilliard, a Democrat from Garden City, was the third state representative who voted differently from his party. Gilliard, who voted for HB316, didn’t return email and phone messages seeking comment.

The legislation is now pending in the state Senate.

How it works

Ballot-marking devices are a voting system that combines technology and paper ballots. Voters tap a touchscreen to make their selections, similar to the state’s current voting voting machines. The touchscreen is attached to a printer that spits out a paper ballot. Then voters could review their choices on the paper ballot before inserting it into an optical scanning machine for tabulation.",Why 3 Georgia lawmakers didn’t toe the party line on voting machines,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/why-georgia-lawmakers-didn-toe-the-party-line-voting-machines/jm3CqlwZcAEcwl2PHfzOHO/

For inspiration, Singh could draw from the democratic socialist movements gaining popularity in the U.S. and U.K., he said. “There’s a bit of ...","NDP leader Jagmeet Singh easily won the Burnaby South byelection Monday night, pushing aside, at least for now, doubts about his ability to lead the party into the fall federal election.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut’ Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.

But analysts told The Tyee the true test of Singh’s leadership would be whether he can define the party’s identity in an era of political extremes.

“Friends, you made history today,” Singh told friends, family and supporters in a ballroom in Burnaby’s Hilton Hotel. “When I was growing up, I could have never imagined someone like me running to be prime minister. Guess what, we just told a lot of kids out there that ‘yes you can.’”

In the crowd Singh’s parents beamed with pride while two young teenagers wiped tears from their eyes. Singh won with 39 per cent of the vote. Liberal Richard Lee captured 26 per cent, Conservative Jay Shin 22.5 per cent and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson 10.6 per cent. Voter turnout was about 30 per cent.

During a long, passionate and at times improvised victory speech, Singh shifted back and forth between his identity as the first Indo-Canadian leader of a major political party and an unabashedly left-wing critique of what’s wrong with the country.

“Conservatives and Liberals have rigged the system that works for the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected — not for everyday Canadians,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be this way, we can fix it and we will fix it.”

Singh led the polls all evening, to the delight of his enthusiastic supporters. When NDP MP Don Davies came on stage to announce initial election results he remarked, “there is tremendous energy and excitement in this room tonight.”

Such enthusiasm was not always easy to find during the lead-up to election night. Singh was criticized for his lacklustre performance during a national TV interview with CTV’s Evan Solomon. Some senior NDP members anonymously told CBC that if Singh lost, he’d likely have to resign as leader.

Davies said in an interview Monday night that the byelection victory is a turning point.

“It’s really the flipside of all that chatter about the doomsday scenarios,” Davies said. “I think he’s going to be a decisive winner tonight. I think it’ll put an end to doubts about his leadership and I think every metric will improve, from our polling numbers to our fundraising.”

That might be a tall order, as the NDP is polling below 15 per cent, trailing the Liberals and Conservatives who each have about 35-per-cent support, according to the non-partisan site CalculatedPolitics.

Yet University of Ottawa political theorist and commentator David Moscrop said these low poll numbers may not be as dire as they might seem.

“The NDP is hovering about where’d you’d expect them historically to hover in the polls,” he told The Tyee. “We have this expectation that they ought to be doing better, but that’s a historical anomaly. That’s in part a reflection of the fact that the NDP has done unusually well in recent years. Now they’ve come back down to Earth.”

To return the NDP to the more than 30-per-cent support it enjoyed in mid-2015, he’ll need to define a clear, unapologetic identity for the party, Moscrop said.

For inspiration, Singh could draw from the democratic socialist movements gaining popularity in the U.S. and U.K., he said.

“There’s a bit of a struggle internally, a philosophical struggle as well perhaps a political struggle, over whether [the NDP] ought to make that sharper left turn,” Moscrop said. “They need to decide whether they want to be Liberal-lite, which probably won’t serve them well, or whether they want to run a Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, Corbyn-style campaign.”

This tension isn’t new for the NDP, nor easily resolved.

“This is a perennial debate, this is just the most recent iteration of it,” Stewart Prest, a political scientist at Simon Fraser University, told The Tyee. “Is it a party of principle, which gives a voice to the strongest expression of values that its members can think of, or is it a party that seeks power and tries to make strategic compromises along the way?”

The byelection results offered a preview of another challenge Singh will face heading into the Oct. 21 election. The People’s Party of Canada, which has made open hostility to refugees a core part of its far-right populist platform, won almost about 11 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South.

During one campaign event I attended, Singh said he was “disgusted by some of the values being espoused” by the People’s Party of Canada’s Thompson, who had said more thorough screening of refugees was needed and pointed to the killing of Marrisa Shen as an example of the risks, failing to mention that many Syrian-Canadians have condemned the crime and pleaded for it not to be the basis for a wider refugee backlash.

Prest said Singh, as a highly visible face of Canada’s diversity, is in a good position to fight against politicians who attempt to gain power by stoking racial resentment.

But in doing so Singh could be forced to defend his own cultural background rather than the progressive economic and social policies he stands for — as he has been obliged to do ever since running for the NDP leadership.

“It seems like there may be both an advantage, but also a potential disadvantage for Singh having to play that role,” Prest said.

On Monday night, Singh was obviously enjoying his victory, dancing on stage, grinning and high-fiving supporters, while also reminding them about the long road ahead.

“I’m asking you all to keep this fight going for the next eight months, I need you to be a part of this,” he said as his speech came to a close. “The people at the top and the wealthiest corporations have it way too good for way too long.”",Jagmeet Singh’s Next Hurdle: Define His Party in an Era of Extremes,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/02/26/Singh-Next-Hurdle/

The cleavage between Canada and Mexico over the upheaval enveloping their broader hemispheric neighbourhood — the meltdown of once prosperous Venezuela that has spawned a three-million-plus refugee crisis — was on full display this week as lawmakers from both countries met in Ottawa to discuss their shared interests.

Mexico was a charter member of the Lima Group of countries when it formed in August 2017 before socialist firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1 as Mexico’s new president. Lopez Obrador’s government has been conspicuously absent from the Lima Group’s recent declarations recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim leader of Venezuela, and the group’s calls for the military to switch allegiance to him from the country’s socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. “It’s a very complex issue because we believe — the new government believes strongly — in not intervening in the internal affairs of other countries,” Sen. Hector Vasconcelos, head of the Mexican senate’s foreign affairs committee, said in an interview.

Part of that complexity involves the other major North American country that was never in the Lima Group — the United States. As Canadian officials routinely explain, not having the U.S. in the Lima Group coalition of more than a dozen Western Hemisphere countries is seen as effective. The reason is because it divorces calls for Maduro’s ouster from the baggage of what is seen as past American meddling in Latin America. Many don’t buy that rationale, pointing to the fact that the U.S. remains in lock-step with the Lima Group while the Trump administration refuses to rule out potential military action in Venezuela. “When you have a major international power trying to impose a solution to a political situation, to a political crisis anywhere in the world, not only in Latin America, the prospects for success are not very good,” said Vasconcelos. He cited American interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan in this century and Vietnam four decades ago as some U.S. failures.

Mexico has offered to mediate between Guaido and Maduro to find a solution that’s satisfactory to the Venezuelan people, Vasconcelos said. Canada, its Lima Group allies, the U.S. and dozens of other countries say international support for the opposition is intended to embolden Venezuelans, with the help of a military it wants to see switch loyalties, to take democratic control of their country.

Vasconcelos said he’s OK if the Venezuelan military switches sides and contributes to Maduro’s peaceful ouster. “If the armed forces decide to stop supporting president Maduro, then that would be finding an internal solution,” he said, stressing that doesn’t mark a departure from the current Mexican position. “Believe me there are reasons for this. And I think that Mexico derives benefits from that position even today after 100 years of trying to follow that line.” A Liberal MP who took part in this week’s parliamentary meetings with Mexico says Canada is trying to persuade Mexico to support the Lima Group. “Obviously, Canada has a difference of opinion. We think Mexico, as a serious player in the hemisphere, should be working with us. They haven’t walked away from Lima necessarily, but they’re being very cautious,” said Bob Nault, the former head of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee. “My advice is to keep working with Mexico very quietly to convince them the policy of the past is not going to work in the scenario that’s unfolding in Venezuela and other countries.” Despite the difference on Venezuela, Vasconcelos and other members of the Lopez Obrador’s governing Morena party see several broad areas of co-operation with Canada. In addition to ratifying the newly renegotiated North American free trade pact, these issues include trying to tackle the northward flood of migrants from Central America, and combating climate change without a willing partner in the United States. “Mexico and Canada agree on many things, but not the United States and that’s an awful thing because the United States, their environmental impact is really big,” said Mexican Sen. Antares Guadalupe, also a Morena member. “It is important to try and get the United States with us in these efforts.”","Canada, Mexico divided on Venezuela amid united push for new NAFTA",Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/03/01/canada-mexico-divided-on-venezuela-amid-united-push-for-new-nafta.html

The hot topics he touched on ranged from issues across the board, including the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, the importance of freedom of religion, the controversy surrounding late-term abortion, the call to universal condemnation of anti-semitism, and the Democrat proposed Green New Deal.

A promise to build the southern border wall

While President Donald Trump has been adamant about seeking out more funding for the construction of a physical barrier along the southern border, Democrats are looking to block the president’s national emergency declaration — which the president declared in hopes of receiving more than the provided $1.375 billion toward border security.

However, Pence stood firm behind the president and promised the Trump administration will build the wall.

“As the president has said if you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country,” Pence said.

“And I’ll make you a promise. Before we’re done, we’re going to build it all,” he told the crowd.

“Build that wall” chants broke out amongst the attendees.

“Oh, we’re building it,” Pence responded.

As several Democrats have called for the defunding of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Pence swiped back saying the Trump administration “will never abolish ICE.”

He challenged Congress Democrats to “stand up for border security, stop playing politics with the security of the American people, and stand with President Trump for a stronger and safer America.”

Watch the video below:

Additionally, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) spoke before Pence at CPAC about the border wall, offering a reason Democrats won’t give funds to President Trump.

“Here is their reasoning, Trump equals wall, we the Democrats hate Trump, therefore no wall.”

The freedom of religion

“The freedom of religion is not just enshrined in our Constitution, it’s enshrined in the hearts of the American people,” Pence said, adding that the freedom of religion has been “under attack” in the U.S.

U.S. second lady Karen Pence was criticized for her new controversial part-time job teaching art at a Christian school due to the fact the school follows Christian morals.

Pence, who previously defended his wife’s job and said “criticism of Christian education in America should stop,” reiterated at CPAC that he “couldn’t be more proud of my wife.”

“I’ll make you a promise — under this president and this administration we will always stand with people of faith, we will always defend the freedom of religion of every American, of every faith.”

Abortion controversy

Amid the recent abortion controversy surrounding the late-term abortion bill that was passed in the state of New York, as well as Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) coming under fire for his comments and Senate Democrats blocking the “Born-Alive” bill, Pence defended the right to life.

Pence touted the idea that President Trump is the “most pro-life president in American history.”

“With Democrat standing for late-term abortion, infanticide and a culture of death, I promise you this president, this party, and this movement will always stand for the unborn,” he said. “We will always defend the unalienable right to life.”

Green New Deal

The vice president blasted the Green New Deal laid out by Democrats, saying the deal will only be about “how much green it will cost taxpayers if Democrats ever pass it into law.”

Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is hesitant on the controversial resolution proposed by her Democratic colleagues, recently saying she can’t “say we’re going to take that and pass it,” as IJR Red reported.

Minority walks out again over new Founders’ Day holiday

Parliament of Ghana

The Minority in Parliament’s protest of the amendment to the Founders’ Day holiday continued on Friday with another walk out.



The Akufo-Addo administration plans to designate August 4 as Founders’ Day with an amendment to the Public Holidays Act 2001 (Act 601) in honour of the multiple persons that contributed to Ghana’s liberation from colonial rule.



The current Founders Day holiday on September 21 is solely in honour of Ghana’s first President, Kwame Nkrumah, which the Minority views as an inaccurate representation of the nation’s history.



The National Democratic Congress (NDC) government in 2012, first earmarked September 21, Kwame Nkrumah’s birthday and it has voiced opposition to the change since it was proposed in 2o17.



The Minority MPs walked out on Thursday to demonstrate their disapproval of the amendment.



The Adansi-Asokwa, K.T Hammond, who is on the Majority side, said Kwame Nkrumah will never be recognized as the only founder of the country.



“Let us get history right, how will you say there is only one founder of Ghana? We [NPP] of our [Dombo-Busia] tradition will never accept that Kwame Nkrumah was the founder of Ghana. He was one of them. Among the lot, I will not even say he is the Primus inter pares.”



“We have Paa Grant and JB Danquah, Ako Adjei putting together resources to bring you from the diaspora, how do you come and say you are the person who started the talk. We will never agree.”



January 7 is also being earmarked as Constitution Day by the Akufo-Addo administration with the amendment.



The amendment further seeks to scrap Republic Day and AU Day as public holidays.



Background



Setting the birthday of Kwame Nkrumah as Founder’s Day sparked debate over whether other contributors to Ghana’s independence were being sidelined.



In President Nana Akufo-Addo’s proposal, September 21 will now be observed as Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Day.



The Presidency’s statement at the time said August 4, is “obviously the most appropriate day to signify our recognition and appreciation of the collective efforts of our forebears towards the founding of a free, independent Ghana.”



The shift was met by criticism from across the political divide, especially groups with Nkrumaist ties.



The NDC, known for its support for Nkrumaist ideals, deems this move as an attempt to distort Ghana’s history by enforcing the idea that Ghana had multiple founders.



This is because August 4 is a pivotal day for groups within the Danquah-Busia tradition, of which the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) belongs.



“Any attempt to force on us some founders will be resisted by all progressive forces in this country. Ghana’s founding president’s birthday is September 21. That day has been recognized by even the African Union,” the NDC National Organiser, Kofi Adams said in 2017.



August 4 is noted as the date for the formation of the Aborigines’ Rights Protection Society by John Mensah Sarbah in 1897, and the formation of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) in 1947 by J.B. Danquah and George Alfred “Paa” Grant.",Minority walks out again over new Founders’ Day holiday,Ghanaweb.com,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Minority-walks-out-again-over-new-Founders-Day-holiday-727317

I DON’T recall which government of which particular persuasion, dreamt up the ridiculous notion of unaccountable police commissioners to replace a tried and tested, accountable police authority, which had functioned for decades as part of the ‘answerable’ local authority democratic process.

We, in North Yorkshire, who generally will vote for anything with the slightest of bluish tinges, had foisted upon us a Conservative nominee as police commissioner of whom we knew nothing.

Other parties and independent nominees in North Yorkshire have little chance of success, meaning any other well-qualified candidate stood little chance of having control of a business (and that’s what the police is) with a colossal budget, financed by the taxpayer.

Despite public dissatisfaction with the ability of Julia Mulligan, and a collection of grandiose pointless projects, such as relocating the police headquarters to a totally unsuitable greenfield site, subsequently returning into a totally unsuitable town centre site in Northallerton, she got re-elected at the first re-election process because the political blue tinge swayed the vote.

Irrespective of her previous results, people were voting on party lines as opposed to what was good for the area. An independent nominee who was well-qualified stood against her and lost, leaving the taxpayers of North Yorkshire to finance more nonsense and inefficiency.

During her tenure, there has been a series of short-term ‘lacklustre’ Chief Constables. We now hear the crime rate is increasing, public confidence in the police generally is at an almost all-time low; and yet expenditure at Mulligan Towers in Harrogate is rising.

Despite the district councils and the county council opposing the inclusion of the fire service into Ms Mulligan’s remit, they were overruled by the Home Office. Fortunately, the Conservative Party have seen the light and have declined to re-select Julia Mulligan.

Wrong way to be accepted

From: David Craggs, Shafton Gate, Rotherham.

WHAT puzzles me about the interviews I’ve seen with the young woman Shamima Begum was the way she failed to put forward a case to be accepted back into the UK.

Personally I’d have sobbed into the microphone, genuinely pleading my case.

How I’d made a huge mistake joining IS, how I wanted to join my family, get back into full-time education, including university, so that I could make a useful contribution to the country that had accepted me back.

I would have emphasised that I wanted to give my baby the best possible start in life, being educated in one of the best systems in the world. Why hasn’t she done this? Could it be that some sort of misguided loyalty, and pride, is preventing her doing so? Her attitude seemed to indicate that she felt that she would be doing us a favour by allowing her to return to the UK rather than the other way round.

Let Brexit rebel resign

From: Bob Watson, Baildon.

JUSTICE Secretary David Gauke, along with two other Government Ministers, is threatening to resign unless Brexit is delayed if Parliament does not approve a deal in the coming days (Tom Richmond, The Yorkshire Post, February 26).

Well, considering that Mr Gauke is suggesting scrapping short jail terms of six months or less, the sooner he goes the better. Hopefully he will then be replaced by a Minister who will have much more regard for public safety.

At the moment it appears that both he and Prisons Minister Rory Stewart are disaster areas.

We just got on with it

From: Gillian Anderson, Warren Lane, Eldwick.

YOUR correspondent Mrs C Gannon (The Yorkshire Post, February 23) echoes the view what many people feel about reducing the hours of the school day. It would be totally stupid!

Her comments also about how tired young people complain of feeling when working six-hour days is something we hear often these days. My husband and I have also heard the younger generation complaining about tiredness.

My husband had a demanding and responsible full-time job for 47 years.

In addition to his initial studies to qualify for Public Health diplomas, he got married at 22, subsequently became a father to two children, did his 50/50 share of housework etc, had twice-weekly commitments to his hobby playing in a brass band, did additional degree studies (sandwiched between working full-time ) for his career and carried out his duties with me as parents, ensuring we had plenty of leisure time with the children as a family.

He (and me) just got on with it, even when he was feeling tired. We hear our two children, both now in their late 30s complain of feeling tired, and while both have busy full-time jobs, neither seems to have lives as fully packed with what their father has had.

He never complained. I think today’s younger generation need a good shaking. They don’t know how well off they are.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin, The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons' Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec's pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec's current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October's federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she ""experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion"" over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau's cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs' department amid the fallout of the scandal.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,"" Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould's testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that ""a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.""

While Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau's approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

In that period, we will get a better sense of whether the damage caused by former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s devastating testimony before the Commons justice committee on Wednesday is, in fact, mortal. The Prime Minister will have to decide whether in staying in his position, he will be leading his party, and its candidates, off a cliff in next fall’s general election. (He is.)

There surely must be conversations already taking place within Liberal ranks about this. If there’s not, there should be. There are also undoubtedly some deep and grievous divisions that have been created within Liberal ranks by the SNC-Lavalin affair in general and the treatment of Ms. Wilson-Raybould more specifically.

Story continues below advertisement

There is certainly a faction within the party today who believe that it is someone of Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s integrity and moral standing, if not the woman herself, who should be leading the Liberals into the next election and not Mr. Trudeau.

And let’s not forget the quandary this scandal has created for the Canadian public, particularly those voters of a progressive bent. Many of them supported the Liberal agenda. They liked the fact Mr. Trudeau appeared to take the ominous risk of climate change seriously and was prepared to do something about it.

But by turning their back on the Prime Minister and his party over the SNC-Lavalin matter, they are paving the way for the return to power of a party that apparently does not take the threat of climate change seriously. What a maddening and infuriating dilemma, and for what? Simply for the Liberals to score political points by extending a hand to a Quebec corporation that has serious corruption charges hanging over its head?

The Liberals are now officially dead in the West, if they weren’t already. I’m not sure how Mr. Trudeau could show his face in Alberta, for instance. If you believe Ms. Wilson-Raybould, and I certainly do, then we can believe the extent to which the Prime Minister was prepared to go to help SNC-Lavalin in a bid to pander to Quebec. Imagine how that went over at the local Tim Hortons in Fort Mac.

The Liberals’ tiny bastion of hope west of Ontario resided in some ridings in and around Vancouver. But that hope began to fade precipitously as soon as Ms. Wilson-Raybould began talking. Now she is being hailed as a national hero and a future leader. Voters in Vancouver will not take kindly to the way our so-called feminist Prime Minister and mostly male actors implicated in this mess conducted themselves.

And the scary thing is, this story is likely worse than we know.

Beyond what she did divulge, Ms. Wilson-Raybould alluded to conversations with the Prime Minister and others that relate to this matter, and which she believes are pertinent and in the public interest.

He may live to regret his decision to allow Ms. Wilson-Raybould to speak to the extent that she did. It was the right thing to do, perhaps the only right thing the Prime Minister has done yet in this entire affair. But it has come at a steep political cost. It may yet come at the ultimate political cost.

At this point, Mr. Trudeau seems determined to fight on, to persevere and endure the storm that will go on for some time yet. He has handed his political opponents a gift they could scarcely have dreamed of receiving this close to an election. He has given Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer a stick with which he can bludgeon the Prime Minister for months.

Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould began speaking, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel stood in the Commons during Question Period to ask the Prime Minister about a report out of Montreal alleging that SNC-Lavalin paid tens of thousands of dollars for the services of prostitutes and naked dancers to entertain the son of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi during a tour of Canada.

Now, the Prime Minister might lose his job over his alleged attempts to defy his attorney-general and help cut this same company a break.

The absence of Quebec heavyweights on his team has been apparent from the beginning of his tenure as Prime Minister.

So it is beyond ironic that the overwhelming impression left by former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony before the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday is that the Prime Minister was willing to go to extraordinary lengths to win votes in Quebec. There was a pathetic air of desperation in attempts by Mr. Trudeau and his staff to get her to change her mind about prosecuting SNC-Lavalin.

The greatest damage done by this affair, then, may not be the threat to the independence of the judicial system that it has raised. By serving to perpetuate every negative stereotype the rest of Canada holds about politicians pandering to Quebec, the SNC-Lavalin scandal will further inflame regional resentments – and may even backfire spectacularly.

As Ms. Wilson-Raybould described it in her testimony, the Prime Minister, his political staffers and even the assumed-to-be non-partisan Clerk of the Privy Council repeatedly impressed upon her the electoral consequences in Quebec of failing to offer a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin. The engineering giant, facing fraud and corruption charges, had been seeking a deal under new federal legislation that allows companies to defer prosecution in exchange for making amends.

The political pressure from above began soon after the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, informed the then-attorney-general on Sept. 4 that she would not “invite” SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a DPA. Ms. Roussel did not provide any reasons for her decision, other than to say she considered it “inappropriate” to defer prosecution.

Two days later, Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s chief of staff, Ben Chin, contacted his counterpart in Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s office. “He said to her,” according to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, “that if [SNC doesn’t] get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s a Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen.”

By Sept. 17, Ms. Wilson-Raybould had thoroughly reviewed Ms. Roussel’s decision and decided she would not intervene to overturn it, even though the law allowed her to do so. She said the principle of prosecutorial independence guided her decision.

In a meeting that day with Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Mr. Trudeau and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick apparently would not take “no” for an answer. Mr. Wernick alluded to the Oct. 1 election in Quebec. The Prime Minister piped up: “And I am an MP in Quebec.”

The Quebec election came and went without any word of Ms. Roussel’s decision leaking. It was not until Oct. 10, when SNC-Lavalin revealed her decision, that the news became public. The attempts by the PMO to put pressure on Ms. Wilson-Raybould only intensified after that.

Instead of the Quebec election, the political imperative now involved the federal Liberals’ own “need to be re-elected,” in the words of PMO senior adviser Mathieu Bouchard. A lawyer who had teleguided his friend Mélanie Joly’s 2013 failed bid for the Montreal mayoralty, Mr. Bouchard had been recruited to join the PMO in 2015 to manage the Quebec file. But the former sovereigntist was outranked in power, influence and experience by chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal secretary Gerald Butts, both high-powered veterans of Ontario Liberal politics who know little about Quebec.

In the following weeks, until Ms. Wilson-Raybould was demoted from the justice portfolio in January, she and her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince were repeatedly badgered by Mr. Butts, Mr. Wernick, Mr. Bouchard and other senior political staff to “find a solution” to the SNC-Lavalin problem. During what she described as “the final escalation in efforts by the PMO to interfere in this matter,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould faced “veiled threats” that she might lose her job.

Meanwhile, frustrations in Canada’s Western provinces have only intensified since the demise of the Energy East pipeline, which TransCanada decided to abandon after Mr. Trudeau imposed an upstream carbon-emissions test on the project. Western Canada has been smarting ever since at what it interpreted as a backhanded move to kill a pipeline unpopular in Quebec.

But it is an insult to the intelligence of Quebec voters to think they would be any less outraged than other Canadians at the prospect of a Prime Minister and his staff intervening in the independence of the judicial system for political ends. The PMO’s slimy attempts to bring political pressure to bear on Ms. Wilson-Raybould will not win Mr. Trudeau any votes in Quebec – and will likely cost him many.

By sickening everyone, Mr. Trudeau might have just united the country – against him.

One law for the rich and powerful. Another law for everybody else. That’s the underlying message in the testimony of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, given this week to the Justice Committee of the House of Commons.

For four hours, Wilson-Raybould painted a picture of a Prime Minister’s Office that held itself above the law, that sought to protect its own interests above those of the voters by flouting one of the basic principles of Canadian democracy: politicians cannot interfere in the justice system. Once you cross that line, it’s a slippery slope to a place where the rule of law is meaningless, and the citizen becomes powerless before the state.

The Liberals see it differently. They claim that they were standing up for that citizen, defending Canadian jobs, including the 9,000 at SNC-Lavalin. Their narrative is simple: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his acolytes were simply helping former Wilson-Raybould understand what could happen if she didn’t grant the company a deferred prosecution on corruption charges. SNC-Lavalin might get bought out! Move its headquarters to London! Lay off thousands of workers!

But there’s one small problem: if Wilson-Raybould’s testimony is correct, this line is a colossal lie. Election prospects, not employment, were the government’s prime concerns. First, the re-election of a Liberal government in Quebec, which failed to materialize in October 2018. Then, the fact that Trudeau was the MP for Papineau, a riding in Quebec, a point he personally made clear to Wilson-Raybould. Finally, the re-election of the current federal Liberal government, which it hopes will occur in October 2019.

These concerns were repeatedly impressed upon the then-attorney general, despite the fact that the handbook for the director of public prosecutions specifically excludes “possible political advantage or disadvantage to the government or any political group or party” as a criterion for deciding whether to use the provision.

WATCH BELOW: The latest in the SNC-Lavalin affair

After Wilson Raybould refused to budge, Trudeau demoted her in mid-January and replaced her as AG with Quebec MP David Lametti, previously Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Innovation. Wilson-Raybould testified that the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, told her former deputy minister that one of the first orders of business for the new AG would be a conversation with the PM about SNC-Lavalin. A month later, Lametti was quoted in The Globe and Mail as saying that a deferred prosecution was “still possible” — a position diametrically opposed to that of his predecessor.

Wilson-Raybould may characterize these acts as “inappropriate” as opposed to illegal, but taken together, they could add up to obstruction of justice. The penalties for this crime are severe. Section 139 (2) of the Criminal Code states that “Every one who wilfully attempts ... to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.”

Or at the very least, political purgatory. Such was the case in 1990, when the Liberals demanded the resignation of then-Progressive Conservative MP Jean Charest on charges of political interference with the judiciary. Charest, then minister for sport, had admitted making an improper phone call to a judge who was set to rule on an athletics case. That’s small beer compared to the level of pressure applied to Wilson-Raybould. But Charest did the honourable thing and quit the Cabinet, to be reinstated a year later by then-prime minister Brian Mulroney.

If Trudeau had any decency, he would resign as prime minister and call an election. If he doesn’t, the RCMP should launch an investigation into his conduct and that of his office, to determine whether charges of obstruction are warranted. If he really believes in the rule of law, as he has repeatedly said in recent months, he should practise what he preaches, do what is expected from a prime minister, or make way for someone who will.

No new faces are joining the team; rather Trudeau is moving around ...","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has shuffled his federal cabinet for the second time in less than two months, to fill the vacancy left following Jody Wilson-Raybould's abrupt departure.

No new faces are joining the team; rather Trudeau moved around current ministers:

The new Veterans Affairs Minister is Lawrence MacAulay, who was previously the minister for agriculture and agri-food.

Replacing MacAulay as Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister is Marie-Claude Bibeau. She was previously the minister for international development.

Taking on the position of International Development Minister is Maryam Monsef, who adds that responsibility to her current job as the Minister for Women and Gender Equality.

""In their new roles, the ministers will advance some of the Government of Canada's top priorities,"" a release from the Prime Minister's Office says.

MacAulay is a long-time Liberal MP from P.E.I., and has previously handled the veterans affairs portfolio when it was a secretary of state role many years ago.

""To represent veterans at the cabinet table, it's a distinct honour, it's an honour to be a minister at the table in any portfolio, but to have the chance to be in veterans affairs, really for the second time, is indeed a great honour,"" MacAulay said. ""To have the honour to represent the people who preserve peace and democracy for us worldwide, that's a long piece from a demotion,"" he said.

Bibeau, a Quebec MP was first elected in 2015 and has been in the international development role since Trudeau named his first front bench lineup. Prior to politics she worked in the international development field, and owned a small camping business.

She becomes Canada’s first female federal agriculture minister.

""It's a huge privilege. I come from a rural riding, a dairy riding, actually, in the south of Quebec, so I'm already very close to the agricultural producers in Quebec, I know quite a bit about supply management,” she said.

Monsef was also first elected in 2015. She represents an Ontario riding and first held the democratic institutions role before being shuffled into the status of women portfolio in 2017.

""The work continues"" Monsef said, vowing ""continue to ensure that women are at the heart of the work that we do.""

The last time Trudeau shuffled his cabinet was in January. That rejigging — prompted by longtime Liberal Scott Brison's departure — set off a series of events that have compounded in the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal.

At that visit to Rideau Hall, Trudeau shuffled Jody Wilson-Raybould out of her role as attorney general and justice minister and appointed her to veterans affairs. Replacing her was rookie Quebec MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould's move was seen by many as a demotion.

He also moved Jane Philpott to president of the Treasury Board and minister of digital government from Indigenous services. Replacing her as Indigenous services minister was former veterans affairs minister Seamus O'Regan. Trudeau also tapped rookie Nova Scotia MP Bernadette Jordan to join cabinet as rural economic development minister. She also fills the space left for a minister from that Atlantic province after Brison left.

Wilson-Raybould resigned as minister of veterans affairs on Feb. 12 in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has been temporarily covering the portfolio since then.

The shuffle marks the end of a tumultuous week for the prime minister. On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould testified before the House of Commons Justice Committee that, as the former attorney general, she faced a sustained months-long effort by nearly a dozen government officials pressuring her to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

In her stunning testimony, Wilson-Raybould described ""veiled threats"" from top officials within the Trudeau government. She also said that she believed she was shuffled as a result of her refusing to bow to pressure to direct federal prosecutors to drop the criminal case against the Quebec construction and engineering giant.

Trudeau has denied acting inappropriately and said he “completely” disagrees with Wilson-Raybould’s ""characterization"" of events.

After this morning's shuffle, Trudeau did not hold a media availability.

During their availability outside of Rideau Hall after their swearing-in ceremony, all three ministers were asked whether they were comfortable with Wilson-Raybould remaining in caucus.

They all offered responses along the lines of being comfortable with whatever decision Trudeau makes.

""These decisions are made by the prime minister and whatever decision that’s made... I can live with any decision that is made. But I know Jody, a well-respected lady,"" MacAulay said.

Earlier this week, Jody Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau's former Attorney General, delivered explosive testimony that alleged the Canadian leader and his senior aides pressured her to intervene and defer criminal charges in a case against Montréal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

If the current bribery charges that the firm is facing — which date back to contracts the company was awarded in Qaddafi-era Libya — lead to a conviction, it would be banned from bidding on federal contracts for a decade. That would likely result in the firm either dissolving or moving out of the country.

JUSTIN TRUDEAU DODGES CALLS TO RESIGN AMID FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ALLEGATIONS IN BRIBERY SCANDAL

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was a political earthquake for the Liberal Party, which entered 2019 expecting to sail to a relatively easy second term at an election scheduled for this October. Overnight, the party’s chances at re-election have dimmed considerably, and Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer this week took the extraordinary step of calling for Trudeau’s resignation.



“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done,” the Tory leader said following Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.



Trudeau and his allies in the government have denied that Wilson-Raybould’s testimony is accurate, but they will soon have a testimony of their own to directly refute her. Following her appearance before the House of Commons Justice Committee, the Prime Minister’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts asked the committee’s chair — via Twitter — if he, too, could testify about the SNC-Lavalin affair. Such a request is unusual but reflects the unprecedented nature of the current scandal engulfing Canadian politics.

It seems unlikely Butts will admit to any wrongdoing when he testifies before the committee. In his 18 February resignation letter, he wrote, “at all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians...From my perspective, our relationship [between Butts and Wilson-Raybould] has always been defined by mutual respect, candor and an honest desire to work together.”



For nearly four years, Butts was the most powerful person in the Prime Minister’s office, and is considered the architect of the campaign that catapulted the Liberal Party from third-place to the government benches at the 2015 federal election. But Butts abruptly resigned from his position in February, days after the SNC-Lavalin scandal was first broken by The Globe & Mail.



It isn’t known yet exactly what Butts will say in his testimony, expected this coming Wednesday, but it is nearly certain he will come to the defense of the office he left several weeks ago, and in particular Trudeau himself, chief of staff Katie Telford, and legal advisor Mathieu Bouchard, all of whom were accused directly by Wilson-Raybould of attempting to politically interfere in the SNC court case.

TRUDEAU'S TOP ADVISER RESIGNS BUT DENIES WRONGDOING

“In my view, these events constituted pressure [from Trudeau, Butts, Telford and Bouchard] to intervene in a matter and that this pressure or political interference to intervene was not appropriate. However, Canadians can judge this for themselves, as we now have the same frame of information,” she said in her testimony.



Even if Trudeau manages to weather the scandal and cling to power at this fall’s election, many in his party are now unsure he should stay on as leader. Wilson-Raybould herself is reportedly among those in the party with prime ministerial aspirations.



That could be among the reasons why Trudeau suggested at a press conference in St. Hubert, Que., earlier this week that he was considering kicking Wilson-Raybould out of the Liberal caucus.

""I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,"" he said.



She had previously reaffirmed her desire to remain a Liberal MP, and committed to running for re-election under the party’s banner in her wealthy inner-Vancouver seat. However, Trudeau could unilaterally decide to remove her from the party’s parliamentary caucus anyway. If next week’s testimony doesn’t succeed in changing the channel on the scandal, it seems likely he may choose to do just that.",Justin Trudeau's former right-hand man to ride to the rescue and testify over damaging corruption scandal,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/justin-trudeaus-former-right-hand-man-to-ride-to-the-rescue-and-testify-over-damaging-corruption-scandal

Two other ministers already ...,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making longtime MP Lawrence MacAulay his new veterans-affairs minister to fill the void left by the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould as part of a minor cabinet shuffle this morning.

Two other ministers already in cabinet are taking on new responsibilities: Marie-Claude Bibeau replaces MacAulay as agriculture minister and Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef takes on the additional portfolio of international development.

That means Bibeau will be responsible for selling trade agreements to Quebec dairy farmers that will reduce the protective effect of supply management in their industry. She's also the first female federal agriculture minister.

""It's a huge privilege — I come from a rural riding, a dairy riding, in fact, in the south of Quebec, so I'm very close to the producers in Quebec,"" she said outside Rideau Hall after being sworn in. She said she's eager to meet with them.

MacAulay will take over responsibility for a new veterans-benefits regime that the parliamentary budget officer reported last week will mean less generous support for veterans leaving the Canadian Forces.

Like Wilson-Raybould before him, MacAulay said he didn't see the move to Veterans Affairs as a demotion.

""To have the honour to represent the people who protect peace and democracy for us worldwide, that's a long piece from a demotion,"" he said.

Unusually, the official headquarters for the Department of Veterans Affairs is outside the capital region — it's in Charlottetown, MacAulay's home province.

Wilson-Raybould, who was moved from the justice portfolio to veterans affairs in the last federal cabinet shuffle in mid-January, resigned her post Feb. 12.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould testified to the House of Commons justice committee that she was pressured by Trudeau, his senior staff and others to halt a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

She said she believed she was shuffled out as attorney general and justice minister because she didn't give in to the political arm-twisting.

Trudeau has denied the SNC-Lavalin affair had anything to do with Wilson-Raybould's move, saying she would still be justice minister had former Treasury Board president Scott Brison not suddenly decided to leave politics.

Asked by reporters, all three of them said they will support Trudeau's decision on whether Wilson-Raybould stays in the Liberal caucus after her public criticisms of the way Trudeau and his staff handled her.

""She's a very well-respected lady,"" MacAulay said of Wilson-Raybould, but what to do about her place in their party is up to the prime minister.

The source, speaking to The Canadian Press on condition of anonymity because no official announcement had been made, said the shuffle will be ""internal to the existing cabinet,"" meaning no new ministers will be brought in.

A small number of ministers will change roles, the source said, primarily so that the Department of Veterans Affairs will have a dedicated minister again.

Wilson-Raybould, who was moved from the justice portfolio to veterans affairs in the last federal cabinet shuffle in mid-January, resigned her post Feb. 12.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has been acting as the minister of veterans affairs since then.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould testified to the House of Commons justice committee that she was pressured by Trudeau, his senior staff and others to halt a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

She also testified that she held firm in her conviction not to intervene in the case, telling Trudeau at one point that she would strongly advise him against interfering with her functions as attorney general.

When asked by Conservative MP Lisa Raitt whether she thought she was removed as attorney general because she ""spoke truth to power,"" Wilson-Raybould said she was ""concerned"" that was the case.

Trudeau has denied that the SNC-Lavalin affair had anything to do with Wilson-Raybould's being moved out of the justice portfolio in January. That shuffle was precipitated by former Treasury Board president Scott Brison's decision to leave politics.

""If Scott Brison had not stepped down from cabinet, Jody Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice and attorney general,"" Trudeau said Feb. 15.

The January shuffle also saw Montreal MP David Lametti take over as justice minister and Nova Scotia's Bernadette Jordan become minister of rural economic development.

Ontario's Jane Philpott moved from Indigenous services to the Treasury Board, while Newfoundland and Labrador MP Seamus O'Regan moved from veterans affairs to Indigenous services.

Now, for the second time in six weeks, Trudeau's ministers will be on the move again.

David Petersen, 52, was arrested Wednesday by Nipawin RCMP and charged with uttering threats against the prime minister and uttering threats against Parliament, according to a news release issued Thursday by the Mounties.

On Feb. 12, the Saskatchewan RCMP’s National Security Enforcement Section learned about statements allegedly made over the phone to an employee at a Canadian government agency, according to the release. The RCMP said that during the phone call, a man threatened he would shoot Trudeau and blow up the Parliament Buildings. The call was reported to Nipawin RCMP, which began an investigation.

The RCMP said there has been no contact between Petersen and the Prime Minister.

Petersen is scheduled to appear in Nipawin Provincial Court on March 6. The Saskatchewan National Security Enforcement Section is continuing to investigate.

Asked if he had any comment when reached by phone Thursday and read the RCMP press release, Petersen indicated he had been on a call with someone at the Canada Revenue Agency. But he denied making any threats to shoot the prime minister or blow up the Parliament Buildings.

“That’s not what I said. It’s out of context. It’s unfair,” he replied.

He said he’s currently under a condition to stay 500 metres away from the prime minister, so clearly it’s “pretty serious.”

Last year, Petersen was one of two commenters and eight administrators of Nipawin-related Facebook pages named in a lawsuit filed by Brian Starkell, the chief of Nipawin’s fire department.

The Facebook comments, made in 2017, pertained to the mechanical failure of Starkell’s town-issued work vehicle. Some had accused Starkell of intentionally damaging it to get a new one.

In an interview with the StarPhoenix at the time of that article, Petersen acknowledged posting the comments listed in Starkell’s lawsuit, but said the examples quoted in the lawsuit left out more of what was in the post.

This is not the first time a Saskatchewan resident has faced charges of making threats to the prime minister. In 2017, Christopher Hayes was found guilty of uttering threats against Trudeau after publishing expletive-laden posts on Facebook saying Trudeau should be shot.

Hayes was fined $500 and given nine months of probation, which included a ban on attending events with Trudeau. He was also prohibited from owning firearms for three years.","Nipawin man accused of threatening to shoot Trudeau, blow up Parliament",Leader-Post,https://leaderpost.com/news/crime/nipawin-man-accused-of-threatening-to-shoot-trudeau-blow-up-parliament

Clearly, they have not been paying attention.

Trudeau has indicated his contempt for the rule of law on numerous occasions, and that started long before he was elected prime minister in October 2015.

On June 17, 2014, Trudeau, then the leader of the third-place federal Liberal Party, vowed to kill the Northern Gateway pipeline if he became prime minister, even though the project had already been approved by the National Energy Board’s joint review panel in December 2013 and had just been passed in the House of Commons.

Not only had Calgary-based Enbridge jumped through literally hundreds of planning and regulatory hoops starting in 2002 — including meeting all 209 extra conditions placed upon it by the NEB — and spent more than $500 million with the project’s other proponents — Trudeau had no regard for a semi-judicial and extremely rigorous process that set Canada apart as a country that did not resort to arbitrary measures and political whim when it came to determining the viability of large infrastructure projects.

A lot of politicians promise many things during election campaigns — and are forced to break them once in power after they recognize that living up to their promise would be a disaster for the country. Jean Chretien was elected in 1993 on a promise to scrap the GST and tear up NAFTA. Thankfully for Canada, he did neither. Stephen Harper vowed that he would not get rid of income trusts. Once in power, when he better understood the implications to the economy, he broke that promise.

Many people thought Trudeau would break his reckless promise to kill the pipeline, just like he broke his promise to bring in a proportional representation electoral system and run a more transparent, different kind of government. Once opposition leaders become prime ministers they tend to get hit over the head with reality and what’s best for the country.

In June 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Conservative government’s approval of Northern Gateway, saying there was a lack of federal government consultation with First Nations in northern British Columbia.

In November 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that his government would not continue consultations with First Nations along the pipeline route as stipulated by the federal court, but it would scrap the project and approve Kinder Morgan’s twinning of the Trans Mountain pipeline (which the federal government has since purchased).

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley did not utter a peep of protest about the scrapping of Northern Gateway — a $7.9-billion project that would have moved 525,000 barrels of oil per day from near Edmonton to the port in Kitimat, B.C., creating thousands of jobs. Curtailment would have not been necessary since the price differential would not have occurred to such a severe extent. But I digress.

Tim McMillan, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said during an interview Thursday that “the cancellation of Northern Gateway was the most damaging thing that’s been done to our economy.

“Northern Gateway was an approved project,” added McMillan. “The federal court came back and said there’s one thing the federal government needs to do, ironically, it’s the same thing that needs to be done on the Trans Mountain project, to conduct better Aboriginal consultation, and the federal government then made the devastating decision just to cancel it. And that sent a very negative signal to global investors and has had the effect of killing thousands of jobs over time, costing our economy tens of billions of dollars.”

It was the arbitrariness of Trudeau’s actions that has frightened investors and many companies.

According to a recent C.D. Howe Institute report, $100 billion in planned spending on resource projects in Canada has disappeared and more losses are expected without substantial changes to the Trudeau government’s regulatory overhaul, Bill C-69.

Bill C-69 will make arbitrariness and political whim the law of the land. It will allow for a political decision at the end of an onerous, costly and lengthy process, simply at the whim of a government minister.

No company is reckless enough to spend $500 million and many years of effort only to have some politically motivated cabinet minister reject the science and data purely for political reasons.

Trudeau’s government also helped kill the Energy East pipeline by moving the regulatory goalposts on the project.

Last week, Devon Energy Corp. announced it’s planning to sell its oilsands assets.

On Wednesday, former Canadian justice minister and attorney general Wilson-Raybould laid out before a Commons justice committee, in devastating detail, the level of contempt that Trudeau, his office and other senior Liberal government officials have for the rule of law and due process.

Her gripping testimony revealed that time and again, the PM and 10 other senior members of his government cared little for the rule of law, applying enormous pressure on Wilson-Raybould to interfere with the independence of the director of public prosecutions to not proceed with a criminal trial against SNC-Lavalin but to enter into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, or remediation, in an effort to ensure that the Quebec-based engineering giant doesn’t leave the province.

“Various officials also urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which it was clearly improper for me to do,” Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee.

“We either have a system that is based on the rule of law, the independence of the prosecutorial functions and respect for those charged to use their discretion and powers in particular ways, or we do not,” she said.

Sorry to break it to you all, but under this federal government, we do not. Bill C-69 is the poster child of the Trudeau government’s lack of respect for due process. So why the surprise?

Butts wrote to the House of Commons justice committee on ...","OTTAWA — Gerald Butts, the former right-hand man to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will publicly defend himself against allegations he attempted to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

Butts wrote to the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday asking for a chance to speak.

“I watched the testimony of the Honourable Jody Wilson-Raybould yesterday,” Butts’s letter said. “I believe my testimony will be of assistance to the (committee) in its consideration of these matters. I respectfully request the opportunity to attend the committee. I need a short period of time to receive legal advice concerning my evidence and to be able to produce relevant documents to the committee.”

Butts, one of Trudeau’s closest friends going back decades, resigned as the prime minister’s principal secretary on Feb. 18, saying he felt it was the right thing to do to defend himself and allow the government to continue its work undistracted.

He is among nearly a dozen people including Trudeau, the finance minister and the country’s top civil servant who Wilson-Raybould said pressured her in the fall of 2018 to drop the corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and negotiate a remediation agreement instead. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing and pay a fine but avoid a criminal conviction.

In her testimony before the justice committee on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she was subjected to “veiled threats” and a four-month “sustained effort by many people in the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”

She described a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau during which she said he told her “there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau.”

“I was quite taken aback,” she testified. “My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask (Trudeau) a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said ‘No, No, No — we just need to find a solution.’”

Speaking to the media in Saint-Hubert, Que., on Thursday morning, Trudeau said he did not agree with Wilson-Raybould’s version of events, and said he’s still reflecting about whether she will remain within the Liberal caucus.

“I and my team always acted in an appropriate and professional manner,” Trudeau said. “So I am not in agreement with the characterization of events that the former attorney general gave in her testimony. We have always defended and looked to protect jobs in Canada and we will always do so.”

Trudeau said the RCMP has not contacted him or other government officials about the affair, to his knowledge. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wrote to the head of the RCMP to launch an investigation, contending that the Liberals broke laws under the Criminal Code related to obstructing justice and interfering with the attorney general. He also repeated calls for Trudeau to step down.

Asked who was telling the truth, Trudeau said the government’s ethics commissioner is investigating and will come to a conclusion. Federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion started his investigation two weeks ago.

Speaking in Toronto on Thursday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau defended his own role in conversations with Wilson-Raybould. “I never raised this issue with Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould,” he told reporters. “She approached me to tell me that my staff was approaching her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould testified that she asked Morneau to tell his staff to stop raising the issue of a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin with her office, but his chief of staff Ben Chin continued to do so.

“My staff, appropriately, would make her staff aware of the economic consequences of decisions, about the importance of thinking about jobs,” Morneau said. He said he did not watch her testimony live because he was in a meeting, but said she is “entitled to her opinion.”

The Liberal-dominated justice committee has asked Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick and Deputy Justice Minister Nathalie Drouin to reappear following their testimony last week. They and Butts will likely testify on March 6.

I am not in agreement with the characterization of events that the former attorney general gave in her testimony

The committee has declined to hear from other key players in the scandal, including Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and Wilson-Raybould’s former chief of staff Jessica Prince.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee about two meetings involving Butts. On Dec. 5, 2018, she met him at the Chateau Laurier hotel. She testified that Butts “took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff.” She alleged he told her that the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which separated the prosecution service from the Justice Department, “was set up by (former Prime Minister Stephen) Harper,” and that he “does not like the law.”

On Dec. 18, Prince met with Butts and Telford. According to a text message sent by Prince to Wilson-Raybould after the meeting, Butts had said: “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.”

Wilson-Raybould also told the committee about a phone call with Wernick on Dec. 19 that she said made her think of the “Saturday Night Massacre,” a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

She testified that Wernick told her Trudeau “is quite determined, quite firm, he wants to know why the (deferred prosecution) route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used … He is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another.”

Less than three weeks later, on Jan. 7, Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould she was being removed as justice minister.

Liberal MPs on the justice committee said they’re inviting Butts, Wernick and Drouin to appear for “clarification” on some issues.

“We believe that it is important that Mr. Butts respond to the account of the meeting of the 18th provided by Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould, in addition to the other allegations about him and PMO colleagues mentioned in her testimony,” said the statement.

“Given that Mr. Wernick and Ms. Drouin appeared prior to cabinet confidence and solicitor client privilege on the SNC file being waived for testimony before the committee, and given that they were both mentioned by Ms. Wilson-Raybould in relation to the December 19th phone call and subsequent events, we would like to hear from them about their recollection of the events and conversations mentioned in Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.”

(Christinne Muschi/Reuters)

To the list of critics slamming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over a massive domestic political scandal, add one foreign player: the People’s Republic of China.

For weeks, Trudeau’s Liberal government has been rocked by claims that it inappropriately pressured the country’s first indigenous attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a firm from the prime minister’s home province.

The case touches on a host of hot-button Canadian issues, including Quebec, indigenous affairs and corporate influence. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs helpfully injected another angle, judicial independence, potentially compounding Trudeau’s troubles.

The question of judicial independence is at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin case. Unfortunately for Trudeau, it was also at issue in another recent legal-political drama: the arrest, in Vancouver, of Huawei Technologies’ chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver’s airport Dec. 1 on U.S. charges, setting off a diplomatic dispute that’s seen China call for Meng’s release and — when that failed — the detention of two Canadian citizens in China.

Trudeau and his team have stressed that Meng’s arrest was a legal matter, not a political one. The prime minister said Canada must adhere to its extradition treaty with the United States and could not and would not interfere on Meng.

When the former Canadian ambassador to China hinted that a deal could be cut, he was forced to resign. “We are a country of rule of law,” Trudeau said, again and again.

On Friday, at a news briefing in Beijing, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs took issue with that claim, telling reporters that Canada has questions to answer when it comes to the rule of law.

A reporter for a Communist Party-controlled news outlet asked the spokesman, Lu Kang, whether it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn’t interfere in Meng’s case while at the same time being accused of intervening on SNC-Lavalin.

Lu, who does not typically praise reporters or weigh in on Canadian politics, responded that he “really liked” the question, according to Reuters. “Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” he said.

""In fact, on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,” Lu continued. “Not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

The reporter’s leading question drew a false parallel between what’s happening in the Meng case, which is in the courts, and a still-unfolding political scandal that’s seen no charges brought — a pretty standard-issue move.

Indeed, since Meng’s arrest, Chinese diplomats and the Communist Party-controlled press have tried to link Meng’s arrest to, among other things, Canadian white supremacy.

But it’s still significant to see a Chinese official comment on the political fortunes of a foreign leader. His tone sends a clear message to Ottawa: We know you are weak.

The question now is whether Trudeau’s Canadian critics pick up Lu’s line of attack. To do so would help China make a point. It would also make things even worse for Trudeau.

Scandals don’t happen in the weird little corners of government, in amateur sport or in crop science. They happen on the issues a prime minister cares most about, because everyone gets the message that the rules matter less than the result.

It’s a constant in politics. In 2016 I took one look at Bill Morneau’s first budget and wrote this: “The sponsorship scandal of the late Chrétien years was possible because it was obvious to every scoundrel with Liberal friends that spending on national unity would not receive close scrutiny from a government that was desperate to be seen doing something on the file. A government that considers the scale of its spending to be proof of its virtue is an easy mark for hucksters and worse.”

It wasn’t a perfect prediction. I kind of expected the hucksters and worse to be outside government. Unless the Trudeau Liberals can produce persuasive evidence that Jody Wilson-Raybould is an utter fabulist (and frankly, I now expect several to try), her testimony before the Commons Justice Committee establishes pretty clearly that the hucksters and worse were running the show. Led by the grinning legatee who taints the Prime Ministers’ office.

There will now be a period of stark partisanship. We’re in an election year. Loyal Liberals will tell themselves, and then everyone else, that the price of looking clearly at Justin Trudeau’s bully club (so many men; wonder how Katie Telford felt about that while she was signing off on every element of it) is ceding the field to Andrew Scheer. Who, they will tell themselves and then the country, is an actual Nazi.

I mean, after all, that’s pretty close to what they told one another, and then Jody Wilson-Raybould, last fall, isn’t it? There was an election in Quebec in the first week of October. And Ben Chin, a former journalist who did whatever Christy Clark needed done in B.C. before moving east to do whatever Bill Morneau and the PMO needed doing, used that thin reed of an excuse to try to sway Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince. “If they don’t get a [deferred prosecution agreement], they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee, paraphrasing Chin’s conversation with Prince.

I’ve never met a Liberal yet who doesn’t reliably confuse his electoral skin with the national interest. So much of what Trudeau and his minions have done in the last year stems from that instinct. Take the ludicrous half-billion-dollar bailout for people in my line of work, never explained, sprung out of nowhere in Morneau’s fall economic update—or as I now like to think of it, between Trudeau advisor Mathieu Bouchard’s meeting (yet another one) with Prince and Michael Wernick’s chat with Wilson-Raybould. You can get a lot of op-eds written with that kind of dough. Take the cool billion the Canada Infrastructure Bank coughed up to pay for a politically popular and impeccably well-connected transit project around Montreal. That money appeared, from a brand-new bank that has not funded a single other project and did not then yet have a CEO [Update, Thursday: Wrong! It had had a CEO since last May – pw], on the day before Philippe Couillard launched the Quebec election campaign. It is now impossible to believe on faith that the Canada Infrastructure Bank is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ben Chin, Mathieu Bouchard, Katie Telford and Justin Trudeau.

But anyway, back to partisanship. Liberals and their many friends across the land will insist that all this behaviour must have no real-world repercussions because the other side cannot be permitted to gain the upper hand. And similarly, a lot of battle-hardened opponents of the Liberals will call for the jails to be opened up to welcome fresh Liberal meat. Fortunately, there is indeed an election coming up, and I’m content to let voters decide the partisan affiliation of the next government. I offer them no counsel.

But we get to draw our own conclusions as citizens. What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like? Tonight I talked with two former public servants whose records rival Michael Wernick’s. Both were flat astonished that he seems not to have pushed back against this deeply disturbing, and plainly widespread, behaviour.

There’ll be time to contemplate mechanisms in the days ahead. I don’t think the ethics commissioner has a broad enough mandate to investigate matters like that Canada Infrastructure Bank investment and other tendrils of this affair. But in the end, the moral collapse of Justin Trudeau’s government teaches each of us a lesson, if we will only listen: There had damned well better be a limit to what we’re willing to do or say, whatever the cause we claim to serve. The rules need to be rules—not for the people we despise, but for ourselves. For myself. For you. Or else we have no souls.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will shuffle ...","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will shuffle his cabinet Friday to fill the vacancy left following Jody Wilson-Raybould’s abrupt departure, but no new faces are expected to join the team, sources tell CTV News.

Sources describe the shuffle – Trudeau’s second in less than two months – as small. As many as three ministers could be moved around.

Wilson-Raybould resigned as minister of veterans affairs on Feb. 12 in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has been temporarily covering the portfolio since then.

It’s unclear who may take over the role, but it’s expected to be an existing Liberal minister.

The shuffle marks the end of a tumultuous week for the prime minister. On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould testified before the House of Commons Justice Committee that, as the former attorney general, she faced a sustained effort for months by nearly a dozen government officials pressuring her to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec construction and engineering giant.

In her stunning hours-long testimony, Wilson-Raybould described “veiled threats” from top officials within the Trudeau government.

Trudeau has denied acting inappropriately and said he “completely” disagrees with Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events.

Shortly after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau to resign as prime minister. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has called for an independent inquiry to investigate what happened.

An emergency debate was held Thursday night in the House of Commons to address Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen, who requested the debate, said the SNC-Lavalin scandal has created “a crisis of confidence in the prime minister.”

Trudeau’s former top adviser, Gerald Butts, will testify next Wednesday before the House of Commons Justice Committee. In a letter offering his testimony, Butts said he thinks his evidence ""will be of assistance"" to the committee.

Friday’s anticipated shuffle will be the second time in less than two months that Trudeau has rejigged his cabinet. In January, Trudeau appointed two new rookie ministers -- David Lametti and Bernadette Jordan – to the front of his bench.

The prime minister also moved three veteran ministers: Ontario MP Jane Philpott, to president of the Treasury Board and minister of digital government; Newfoundland MP Seamus O'Regan, to minister of Indigenous services; and Wilson-Raybould, to minister of veterans affairs.

""Canada is going to the moon,"" Trudeau declared as he made the announcement at the Canadian Space Agency in the Montreal suburb of Longueuil.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced last summer it is embarking on the creation of its new Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon and serve as a springboard for deep-space missions.

The station, about one-fifth the size of the International Space Station, is expected to be fully functional around 2026 and will serve as mission control for lunar missions.

""The Lunar Gateway will be one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken by human beings to date,"" Trudeau said. ""Not only will this moon outpost allow for a long-term lunar presence but it will also serve as a launch pad to Mars and beyond.""

The plan calls for a ""sustainable lunar architecture"" that would allow people and equipment to go back and forth to the moon regularly, NASA says.

Trudeau said the partnership in the Lunar Gateway will be part of a new federal space strategy that will see the government invest $2.05 billion over 24 years. He said the investment will create hundreds of well-paying jobs and contribute $100 million annually to Canada's gross domestic product thanks to the growing space economy.

""It's a long-term commitment. It demonstrates we're in it for the long run,"" said Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains.

Canada's key contribution to the Lunar Gateway will be developing a smart robotic system, to be known as Canadarm 3. The mechanism will repair and maintain the outpost.

""Canadarm was essential to the space shuttle, Canadarm 2 built the International Space Station, so it's only fitting and right that the arm that will repair and maintain the Lunar Gateway will yet again be made in Canada by Canadians,"" Trudeau said.

He got a first-hand look at some of the technology while touring the agency with daughter Ella-Grace, manipulating a camera fixed to the space station and testing out a rover in an agency lab. He later spoke to high school students in a town hall setting.

Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, speaking from the space station where he's on a six-month mission, said that unlike his current workplace, Gateway will not be able to be operated from the ground. Because of the distance, it will have to be autonomous, relying on robotics and artificial intelligence.

""I'm proud and thrilled that Canada will continue the adventure and join in the next chapter of space exploration,"" Saint-Jacques said. ""Gateway will be an outpost where humans can live in lunar orbit, where we will learn to work even more autonomously from mother Earth than we have been doing so far.""

Last November, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine visited Ottawa to make a pitch for Canadian involvement in the moon project. He said at the time that he hoped Canadian expertise in artificial intelligence and robotics could yield a new Canadarm. ""If Canadians want to be involved in missions to the surface of the moon with astronauts, we welcome that,"" he added.

U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said in a statement that Thursday's announcement marks ""the beginning of a new era of U.S.-Canada space co-operation.""

The Gateway project will provide Canadian astronauts time in orbit, said Gilles Leclerc, director general of space exploration for the Canadian Space Agency. He said the arrangement still has to be negotiated, but he expects it will be similar to the agreement governing the space station. In Canada's case, it provides the robotics and has the right to conduct experiments and send crew to the space station.

Leclerc said it's an exciting time in space — particularly with commercial human space flight on the horizon. But the Gateway project fits Canada's space goals.

""The realistic approach is contributing Canadian technologies that's not going to only get us flights but give benefits in terms of the science and real benefits on Earth,"" Leclerc said.

Scheer told reporters that Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to govern” and called on the RCMP to open an investigation into the controversy.

In more than three hours of testimony, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she faced “consistent and sustained pressure” for four months from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada’s top public servant and the finance minister’s office to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The pressure was to seek a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. Which could help the company avoid economic damage and layoffs.

Scheer said it is clear now that Wilson-Raybould was being bullied to “bend the law” for a well-connected corporation. He accused Trudeau of allowing a “systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office” and said the episode marked the final stages of his government.

Meanwhile NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh did not support calls for the prime minister to step down but said it called for a robust independent inquiry.

“He may need to resign because of this,” Singh said.

Wilson-Raybould in her stunning testimony revealed she received 10 different phone calls and 10 meetings about the SNC-Lavalin case between her or key members of her staff and 11 people in the Prime Minister’s Office and other departments. Emails and text messages were also exchanged, she added.

Wilson-Raybould said that in a meeting with Trudeau on Sept. 17, the prime minister said SNC-Lavalin could cut many jobs and possibly move from Montreal without a remediation deal. She said Trudeau also stressed there was a provincial election in Quebec at the time and that he was an MP for the Quebec riding of Papineau.

She also accused Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick of issuing “veiled threats” during a phone call on Dec. 19, in which she alleges he referenced how Trudeau wanted to know why a remediation deal wasn’t being pursued. Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

In a January cabinet shuffle, Wilson-Raybould was promptly demoted to veterans’ affairs minister. She resigned from cabinet earlier this month.

Meanwhile PM Trudeau says he ‘completely disagrees’ with Wilson-Raybould’s account.

“Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We, of course, had discussions of the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possibly impact on pensions,” he said in reference to SNC-Lavalin’s woes.

“My job as prime minister has always been to stand up for Canadians and Canadian workers.”

OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will be up to the country's ethics watchdog to decide who is telling the truth in the SNC-Lavalin affair — himself, or former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Yesterday, Wilson-Raybould detailed what she described as a relentless campaign, including veiled threats, from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada's top public servant and the finance minister's office, for her to intervene and order a ""remediation agreement"" for the company to help it avoid criminal corruption charges.

SNC-Lavalin faces fraud and corruption charges regarding efforts to land business deals in Libya and has hoped to sign a ""remediation agreement"" to allow it to pay a fine and avoid a trial. A conviction on the charges could mean a ban on bidding for federal contracts for 10 years.

Speaking in suburban Montreal Thursday morning, Trudeau said he totally disagrees with how Wilson-Raybould described discussions she had with him and others about the case.

The prime minister said the federal ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, will settle disagreements over what happened.

""Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge, who is an officer of Parliament, who will make a determination in this issue,"" Trudeau said after an announcement at the Canadian Space Agency.

""So, while political parties and various people are making, or trying to draw a lot of attention to this issue, there is a process, both at the justice committee and indeed at the ethics commissioner, that will make a determination on what actually happened here.""

Over more than three hours of testimony Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee of 10 meetings and 10 phone calls involving 11 people between September and December 2018, all aimed at getting her to ""politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada.""

Wilson-Raybould detailed a September meeting she said she had with Trudeau where he brought up the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving Quebec and the spectre of job losses during a provincial election campaign.

Asked Thursday, Trudeau wouldn't say if the company had told him it planned to move its headquarters if it couldn't avoid criminal prosecution in Canada.

He said there were ""many and broad conversations about the importance of defending jobs"" across the country and there was ""no doubt"" those discussions didn't cross any legal lines.

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that's exactly what we've done every step of the way,"" Trudeau said. ""We've also done it in a way that has respected our laws, and respected the independence of the judiciary — of that there actually is no doubt. There are disagreements in perspective on this, but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to the veterans-affairs portfolio in January, a move she believed was a result of her not doing as Trudeau and his staff wanted, even though they denied that was the case.

As for Wilson-Raybould's future as a Liberal, Trudeau said he is still mulling over whether she will be allowed to remain in caucus.

UPDATE 8:00 a.m.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is making longtime MP Lawrence MacAulay his new veterans-affairs minister to fill the void left by the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould as part of a minor cabinet shuffle this morning.

Two other ministers already in cabinet are taking on new responsibilities: Marie-Claude Bibeau replaces MacAulay as agriculture minister and Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef takes on the additional portfolio of international development.

That means Bibeau will be responsible for selling trade agreements to Quebec dairy farmers that will reduce the protective effect of supply management in their industry. She's also the first female federal agriculture minister.

""It's a huge privilege — I come from a rural riding, a dairy riding, in fact, in the south of Quebec, so I'm very close to the producers in Quebec,"" she said outside Rideau Hall after being sworn in. She said she's eager to meet with them.

MacAulay will take over responsibility for a new veterans-benefits regime that the parliamentary budget officer reported last week will mean less generous support for veterans leaving the Canadian Forces.

Wilson-Raybould, who was moved from the justice portfolio to veterans affairs in the last federal cabinet shuffle in mid-January, resigned her post Feb. 12.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould testified to the House of Commons justice committee that she was pressured by Trudeau, his senior staff and others to halt a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

She said she believed she was shuffled out as attorney general and justice minister because she didn't give in to the political arm-twisting.

Trudeau has denied the SNC-Lavalin affair had anything to do with Wilson-Raybould's move, saying she would still be justice minister had former Treasury Board president Scott Brison not suddenly decided to leave politics.

Asked by reporters, all three of them said they will support Trudeau's decision on whether Wilson-Raybould stays in the Liberal caucus after her public criticisms of the way Trudeau and his staff handled her.

""She's a very well-respected lady,"" MacAulay said of Wilson-Raybould, but what to do about her place in their party is up to the prime minister.

UPDATE 7:42 a.m.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shuffled his federal cabinet for the second time in less than two months, to fill the vacancy left following Jody Wilson-Raybould's abrupt departure.

No new faces are joining the team; rather Trudeau is moving around current ministers:

The new Veterans Affairs Minister is Lawrence MacAulay, who was previously the minister for agriculture and agri-food.

Replacing MacAulay as Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister is Marie-Claude Bibeau. She was previously the minister for international development.

Taking on the position of International Development Minister is Maryam Monsef, who adds that responsibility to her current job as the Minister for Women and Gender Equality.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons’ justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

ANALYSIS: The Trudeau brand takes a hit after Jody Wilson-Raybould testimony

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer said. “And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.”

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer’s demand as he touted his government’s record defending jobs and “the independence of our judiciary,” adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

WATCH: Wilson-Raybould’s testimony proves Trudeau lied to Canadians, Scheer says

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould’s testimony underscored his party’s calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau’s inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included “veiled threats” from the country’s top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau’s resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,” Scheer said.

“A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould’s testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events, saying he and his staff “always acted appropriately and professionally.”

Scheer told reporters Wednesday that Trudeau has ""lost the moral authority to govern"" and called on the RCMP to open an investigation into the controversy.

The Conservative leader said he was ""sickened and appalled"" by Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony before the justice committee, which detailed the political interference she claimed to have experienced as the former attorney general.

Watch: Wilson-Raybould says she faced pressure, 'veiled threats' over SNC-Lavalin

In more than three hours of testimony, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she faced ""consistent and sustained pressure"" for four months from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada's top public servant and the finance minister's office to halt the criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould told MPs was repeatedly pressed to overturn a decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement, also known as a deferred prosecution agreement, with SNC-Lavalin. Such a deal would have allowed the company, facing fraud and bribery charges from its dealings in Libya, to avoid a trial that could damage the company and spur layoffs.

Scheer said it is clear now that Wilson-Raybould was being bullied to ""bend the law"" for a well-connected corporation. He accused Trudeau of allowing a ""systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office"" and said the episode marked the final stages of his government.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""That is why I'm calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and resign.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh did not echo Scheer's call for the prime minister's resignation. He said the testimony heard at justice committee reaffirms his party's call for an independent inquiry.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" Singh said.

Wilson-Raybould testified that between Sept. 4 and Dec. 19, there were at least 10 different phone calls and 10 meetings about the SNC-Lavalin case between her or key members of her staff and 11 people in the Prime Minister's Office and other departments. Emails and text messages were also exchanged, she added.

Wilson-Raybould said that in a meeting with Trudeau on Sept. 17, the prime minister said SNC-Lavalin could cut many jobs and possibly move from Montreal without a remediation deal. She said Trudeau also stressed there was a provincial election in Quebec at the time and that he was an MP for the Quebec riding of Papineau.

Wilson-Raybould said she was ""taken aback"" and asked the prime minister if he was politically interfering in her independent role and decision as the attorney general, and that she would ""strongly advise"" against that.

""The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,'"" she said.

The Canadian Press Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould appears at the House of Commons Justice Committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Feb. 27, 2019.

She also accused Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick of issuing ""veiled threats"" during a phone call on Dec. 19, in which she alleges he referenced how Trudeau wanted to know why a remediation deal wasn't being pursued. Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another.""

In a January cabinet shuffle, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to veterans affairs minister and replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti. She resigned from cabinet earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould also testified the pressure she felt did not cross the line, in her opinion, from ""inappropriate"" to illegal.

PM 'completely disagrees' with Wilson-Raybould's account

Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau said he ""completely disagrees"" with his former attorney general's version of events.

""Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We,of course, had discussions of the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possibly impact on pensions,"" he said in reference to SNC-Lavalin's woes.

""My job as prime minister has always been to stand up for Canadians and Canadian workers.""

Trudeau distanced himself from Wilson-Raybould's claim that he politically interfered in the prosecution case against SNC-Lavalin. He said the decision about a deferred prosecution agreement related to Quebec company ""was Ms. Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone.""

""I strongly maintain as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" the prime minister said.

Ryan Remiorz/CP Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019.

He responded to Scheer's call for his resignation by mentioning the upcoming election, saying Canadians will have a ""clear choice"" to make in a few months. He pointed to his government's economic record as a reason for Canadians to re-elect a Liberal government.

The Conservative party, Trudeau said, remains ""the party of Stephen Harper that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues.""

Trudeau sidestepped a question when asked if he would allow Wilson-Raybould, currently the MP for Vancouver Granville, to run under the Liberal banner this fall. He said that he has yet to listen to the entirety of his former attorney general's testimony.

""I will do that before making any further decisions,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould asked if she has confidence in PM

Wilson-Raybould, meanwhile, will likely face questions about whether she can stay in the Liberal caucus in light of her explosive testimony.

At the committee, Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault asked his caucus colleague if she still has confidence in the prime minister.

""I'm not going to get into any conversations about why I resigned other than to say this. I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

In a letter to the Mounties' Commissioner Brenda Lucki Thursday, the Tory leader reiterated the ""serious allegations"" former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould made in a gripping testimony that ran for almost four hours.

Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould detailed what she described as a relentless campaign, including veiled threats, from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada's top public servant and the finance minister's office, for her to order a ""remediation agreement"" for SNC-Lavalin to help it avoid criminal prosecution on charges of fraud and bribery.

Wilson-Raybould said she did not budge and refused to reconsider the public prosecutor's decision to move forward with a criminal trial against the Quebec company. She claims that decision did not hinder growing, ""inappropriate"" pressure from the PMO and other senior government figures to ""politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada.''

""These are incredibly serious allegations. And I do not write these words lightly. But the matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote to Lucki.

Though the Liberals shot down an opposition attempt to open a formal public inquiry into the controversy earlier in February, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion launched his own probe into the matter two weeks ago. Trudeau has maintained that this investigation will uncover the truth.

""Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge, who is an officer of Parliament, who will make a determination in this issue,"" Trudeau said on Thursday.

OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

161,,2019-02-28T16:21:00.0000000Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to step down after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould accused him and other senior government officials of improperly pressuring her to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to step down after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould accused him and other senior government officials of improperly pressuring her to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue governing this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer told reporters Wednesday evening.

“That is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and resign.”

In dramatic testimony before the House justice committee earlier in the day, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she was the target of a “concerted and sustained” campaign by Trudeau and 10 other senior officials to pressure her to broker a deal with the Quebec construction firm that would allow it avoid a criminal trial over accusations of bribing Libyan officials.

The legal tool allowing companies to pay fines instead of facing a trail is known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and was only legalized in Canada by the Trudeau government last year.

However, the federal Public Prosecution Service (PPS) announced in the fall that it would not seek a DPA with SNC-Lavalin and would instead proceed with a trial.

The attorney general can override PPS’ decisions by issuing and publishing a directive in the Canada Gazette. Wilson-Raybould said she refused repeated requests from senior Trudeau officials to intervene and claimed that she was on the receiving end of several “veiled threats,” specifically from Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, urging her to reconsider.

“There was a concerted and sustained effort to interfere in my role as the attorney general and I did not let that happen,” she said.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of the attorney general post and named veterans affairs minister. She resigned earlier this month, shortly after the Globe and Mail reported that the PMO had attempted to pressure her to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

Speaking to supporters Wednesday night in Montreal, Trudeau said he “completely” disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and rejected Scheer’s call for him to resign, arguing “Canadians will have a choice in a few months.”

The next federal election is scheduled for October.

Scheer is also calling for an RCMP investigation into the behaviour of Trudeau and the other officials named by Wilson-Raybould, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wants a public inquiry into the allegations.

“What we just heard today was explosive testimony, this was unprecedented,” Singh said, claiming “everything” is still on the table.

He said Trudeau “might need to resign” following a public inquiry.

“We need to get to the truth,” Singh added.

Here is Scheer’s full statement.

Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done. That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so—into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.

The testimony Canadians have just heard from the former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a Prime Minister who has lost the moral authority to govern. A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

I listened carefully to the testimony of the former Attorney General, and like Canadians, I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate, and frankly illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government. All to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on corruption charges.

Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Canadians knew Justin Trudeau had engineered an unwanted, sustained, and co-ordinated attempt to get Ms. Wilson-Raybould to change her mind and stop the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin. Today, thanks to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, we now know just how intense those efforts were: ten meetings and ten phone calls involving eleven senior government officials relentlessly targeting Ms. Wilson-Raybould over a four month period—with the sole objective of bullying her into bending the law to benefit a well-connected corporation.

The details are as shocking as they are corrupt: multiple veiled threats to her job if she didn’t bow to their demands. Urgings to consider the consequences on election results and shareholder value above judicial due process. And reminders from Justin Trudeau to his Attorney General about his own electoral prospects should she allow SNC-Lavalin’s trial to proceed.

As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends.

Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.

Scheer’s comments come following Wilson-Raybould’s testimony around the SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday.

The hearings centre around the multi-billion dollar Quebec engineering firm and whether the former attorney general was pressured to drop a criminal prosecution against them.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet several days after allegations against the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) emerged, and little more than a month after she was shuffled from the justice office to veterans affairs. She remains a Liberal MP in the Vancouver-Granville riding.

During the hearing on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said that over a period of four months – between September and December 2018 – she “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role of Attorney General of Canada, in an inappropriate effort to secure a prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.”

Following the day’s proceedings, Scheer said he was “sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate, and frankly illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government.”

Trudeau, he added, “can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.”

“According to the facts as have been revealed in media reports, Parliamentary testimony from Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, and most significantly the recent comments of the former Attorney General, Canadians rightly ought to be concerned that criminal law has been violated.”

Scheer said a criminal investigation is necessary for Canadians to understand the full scale of Justin Trudeau’s actions.

“Canadians cannot have a Prime Minister who is willing to commit a crime to protect his political interests,” Scheer said. “We need the police to investigate these serious allegations and Justin Trudeau should immediately resign and allow this investigation to take place.”

But Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants the RCMP to investigate what he contends is possible obstruction of justice by the prime minister.

Scheer wrote RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki on Thursday, calling for an investigation. He also reiterated his call for Trudeau to resign.

Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould detailed what she described as a relentless campaign, including veiled threats, from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada’s top public servant and the finance minister’s office, for her to order a “remediation agreement” for SNC-Lavalin to help it avoid criminal prosecution.

The Montreal engineering giant faces fraud and corruption charges regarding efforts to land business deals in Libya and has lobbied hard for a “remediation agreement” to allow it to pay restitution and avoid a trial. A conviction on the charges could mean a ban on bidding for federal contracts for up to 10 years.

Speaking in suburban Montreal on Thursday morning, Trudeau said he totally disagrees with how Wilson-Raybould characterized discussions she had with him and others about the case.

The prime minister said the federal ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, will settle disagreements over what happened. Dion initiated an investigation into the affair two weeks ago.

“Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge, who is an officer of Parliament, who will make a determination in this issue,” Trudeau said after an announcement at the Canadian Space Agency.

“So, while political parties and various people are making, or trying to draw a lot of attention to this issue, there is a process, both at the justice committee and indeed at the ethics commissioner, that will make a determination on what actually happened here.”

Over nearly four hours of explosive testimony Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee there were 10 meetings and 10 phone calls involving 11 people between September and December 2018, all aimed at getting her to “politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada.”

Wilson-Raybould detailed a September meeting she said she had with Trudeau where he brought up the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving Quebec and the spectre of job losses during a provincial election campaign.

Asked Thursday, Trudeau wouldn’t say if the company had told him it planned to move its headquarters if it couldn’t avoid criminal prosecution in Canada.

He said there were “many and broad conversations about the importance of defending jobs” across the country and there was “no doubt” those discussions didn’t cross any legal lines.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that’s exactly what we’ve done every step of the way,” Trudeau said. “We’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws, and respected the independence of the judiciary _ of that there actually is no doubt. There are disagreements in perspective on this, but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.”

Top ministers echoed the prime minister in separate appearances Thursday.

In Toronto, Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied that his chief of staff, Ben Chin, did anything inappropriate in discussing the SNC-Lavalin case with Wilson-Raybould’s staff.

“My staff, of course, is going to be constantly in communication with other teams across the government, always talking about the importance of the economy, always talking about the importance of jobs and that is their appropriate role,” Morneau said. “I think that Ben was acting entirely appropriately in that capacity.”

Morneau did not directly address Wilson-Raybould’s assertion that Chin pressured her staff to take into consideration the political impact on last fall’s Quebec election if SNC-Lavalin were to move its operations out of the country. He did say that he did not direct Chin to do that.

Morneau emphasized that the company employs 9,000 people across the country and thousands of pensioners are dependent on its continued operation. It was appropriate to take that into consideration, while respecting the rule of law, he said.

In a speech to the Empire Club of Canada, Wilson-Raybould’s successor as justice minister and attorney general, David Lametti, said her testimony was an extraordinary symbol of transparency in the government. He also said it’s useful for the attorney general to sit at the cabinet table – unlike in some other jurisdictions, where the attorney general and justice minister are distinct.

“Just like the world outside politics, each of us is made stronger by talking to each other and coming to better understandings together,” he said. “I believe that these discussions can improve the quality of decisionmaking. The attorney-general is not an island, even in circumstances where a final decision rests with him or her.”

While Trudeau and his ministers seemed intent on projecting a business-as-usual confidence, the Conservatives requested an emergency debate in the House of Commons Thursday on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. The NDP supported the request, which was granted by Speaker Geoff Regan.

Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to the veterans-affairs portfolio in January, a move she believes was a result of her not doing as Trudeau and his staff wanted, even though they denied that was the case.

As for Wilson-Raybould’s future as a Liberal, Trudeau said he is still mulling over whether she will be allowed to remain in caucus.

“I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,” he said.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

At a time when extremism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism, homophobia, Islamophobia and violence targeting minorities is peaking worldwide, those charged with safeguarding us from these horrors seem to be engaged in wilful blindness or worse.

Examples abound. Here in Canada the so-called ""United We Roll"" (UWR) movement, ostensibly a ragtag group of truckers emanating from western Canada and advocating for oil pipelines, rolled onto Parliament Hill last week. While undoubtedly many were focused on the pipeline issue, it's hard to neglect the fact that the convoy was born out of the racist ""Yellow Vest Canada"" (YVC) movement.

Indeed, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network tried to ensure that media, government officials and others were aware of the unavoidable links between YVC and UWR.

Before the convoy arrived on Feb. 19, we publicly explained that UWR was in fact originally to have been called the ""Yellow Vest Convoy."" When it became clear that YWV embraced overt racism, had engaged in online death threats including calls for the arrest and death of the prime minister, supported anti-Muslim hate groups including Canadian Combat Coalition, Soldiers of Odin, and Worldwide Coalition Against Islam, it was clear that a name change was necessary.

Thus the Yellow Vest Convoy became ""United We Roll."" Sadly, however, too many were still associated with the racism emanating from YVC.

The hatred and images of violence from YVC were not hidden. Much of it was directed at Canadian Muslims. That included conspiracy theories blaming local Fort McMurray Muslims for starting the wildfire in order to build a super mosque.

David Selvers, from Sault Ste. Marie, is but one example of bigots attracted to YVC/UWR. He is a Holocaust minimizer, anti-Semite and Islamophobe. So vile were his social media postings that the city of Sault Ste. Marie and others disassociated itself from Selvers Crane business. In fact, even UWR had to distance itself from Selvers given the ugly publicity he was generating.

Sadly, the Yellow Vests movement has now been entirely co-opted by the far right. In Canada, neo-Nazis like Paul Fromm and Brian Ruhe attend their rallies. Faith Goldy, a self-proclaimed propagandist for the alt right movement, spoke at their first Toronto rally and was a featured speaker at the UWR rally last week on Parliament Hill. Lately in France the Yellow Vest movement has engaged in antisemitic and anti-immigration rallies.

Yet, despite the rebrand, despite the close alliances with the racism violence and bigotry of YVC, convoy organizer Glen Carritt still claimed his group identified with the yellow vests and welcomed them to the convoy.

Carritt was not the only one to welcome YVC and other convoy members to Parliament Hill. Andrew Scheer, federal leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, along with Maxime Bernier, leader of the new ultraright ""People's Party,"" hopped on the same bandwagon used by Faith Goldy to support and bring greetings to the small group of convoy protesters.",Bernier and Scheer hop on a racist bandwagon,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9200086-bernier-and-scheer-hop-on-a-racist-bandwagon/

Wilson-Raybould said she came under relentless pressure — including veiled threats — from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff, the top public servant and the finance minister's office to halt a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

article continues below

The massive Quebec-based construction and engineering firm is facing bribery-related charges in connection with work it did in Libya when Muammar Gaddafi was heading the country.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee she believes she was shuffled out of the prestigious justice portfolio to veterans affairs in January because she refused to give in to pressure to allow SNC-Lavalin pay a fine via deferred prosecution, or a remediation agreement, a type of plea bargain that would allow the company to avoid the potentially crippling impact of a criminal conviction.

The Liberal MP for Vancouver-Granville, made the stunning and detailed accusations, breaking three weeks of silence on the affair that has rocked the government, prompting her resignation from cabinet and the departure of Trudeau's most trusted adviser.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, speaking immediately after Wilson-Raybould's testimony, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern the country and called for the prime minister to resign. He also called for a police investigation of Wilson-Raybould's claims.

McLeod reiterated Scheer’s call for Trudeau’s resignation, describing the pressure detailed by Wilson-Raybould as inappropriate and “possibly illegal.”

In response to Wilson-Raybould’s allegations, Trudeau maintained he and his staff “always acted appropriately and professionally. I therefore completely disagree with the former attorney general’s characterization of events.”

McLeod said her jaw dropped when she heard the prime minister’s rebuttal.

Jody Wilson-Ryabould.

“I thought he would come out and he might be a little bit ashamed, that he might of apologized. He has done none of that and it’s shameful,” McLeod said.

She said she believes Wilson-Raybould over Trudeau because the former justice minister made a comprehensive statement under oath that was accompanied by documentation she kept over the last few months.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee she was “hounded’” for months to end the prosecution for months after the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, rejected the idea of negotiating a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin and long after she had unequivocally declared she would not direct Roussel to reverse her decision.

“For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,'' she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould said she didn't consider resigning at the time and didn't directly raise her concerns with Trudeau after Sept. 17, when she first informed him that she believed it would be inappropriate for her to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

Trudeau has said there were vigorous discussions within government about the SNC-Lavalin case, but that he repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on intervening to halt the prosecution was hers alone.

Wilson-Raybould disputed that version of events, saying Trudeau only offered vague assurance after she confronted him directly at the Sept. 17 meeting, two weeks after Roussel had decided not to consider a remediation agreement.

“The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there was no (remediation agreement], there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal,'' Wilson-Raybould said.

She said she explained the law to Trudeau and told him she “had made up my mind” to not intervene with Roussel. But she said Trudeau and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick continued to express concerns, with Wernick noting that Quebec was holding an election in a couple of weeks and Trudeau stressing that he, himself, was a Quebec MP.

“I was quite taken aback,” she said, adding she looked Trudeau in the eye and asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? ... The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’”

Wilson-Raybould detailed instances of what she considered inappropriate pressure by Finance Minister Bill Morneau's chief of staff and others, but said the pressure campaign escalated over the fall, even after SNC-Lavalin went to court to challenge Roussel's rejection of a remediation agreement.

Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo MP Cathy McLeod.

Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince, was eventually summoned to an urgent Dec. 18 meeting with Trudeau's chief of staff, Katie Telford, and his principal secretary, Gerald Butts. Citing text messages from Prince sent to her immediately after the meeting, Wilson-Raybould said the prime minister's top two aides wanted her to hire an external legal expert, possibly a retired Supreme Court justice, to give an opinion on the appropriateness of directing Roussel to reverse her decision on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

When Prince suggested that would be interference, Butts purportedly said, “Jess, there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.”

Telford said an external legal opinion would give the government “cover” and allow Trudeau to say he was doing something. She also offered to line up op-eds in the media supporting a decision to intervene in the prosecution, according to the texts.

But the most egregious pressure came the following day, on Dec. 19, when Wilson-Raybould said she received what she deemed to be three “veiled threats” from the clerk of the Privy Council, Wernick, that she could lose her job.

The country's top civil servant last week told the justice committee he believes there was no improper pressure applied to Wilson-Raybould by him or anyone else.

According to Wilson-Raybould, Wernick told her that Trudeau wanted to know why SNC-Lavalin was not being offered a remediation agreement. She said he told her that the prime minister was “going to find a way to get it done one way or the other” and that it was not good for the attorney general to be “at loggerheads” with the prime minister.

In all, Wilson-Raybould said pressure was exerted on her or her staff by 11 people through approximately 10 phone calls, 10 meetings and numerous emails and text messages. She said they repeatedly raised concerns about the risks to SNC-Lavalin's viability the company was to be convicted of corruption and fraud in relation to work it sought in Libya.

Moreover, Wilson-Raybould said they were worried the company might decide to move its operations out of Quebec, affecting last fall's provincial election in Quebec and potentially hurting more Liberals in the province, including Trudeau, in the federal election this fall.

She said she was told repeatedly the decision was up to her, but added attempts to talk her into a remediation agreement were relentless.

Wilson-Raybould said she didn't speak directly to Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin again until Jan. 7, when he informed her he was about to move her out of the justice portfolio and she suggested it was the result of her refusal to intervene in the prosecution, which he denied. She accepted a move to veterans’ affairs on Jan. 14 and did not resign from cabinet until Feb. 11, five days after an anonymously sourced allegation that she had been improperly pressured first surfaced in the Globe and Mail.

In Wednesday’s response, Trudeau reiterated the decision surrounding SNC-Lavalin was Wilson-Raybould’s to make and that they had conversations of the potential loss of 9,000 jobs and pensions. He said jobs and the economy are key issues for his government and it’s his job as prime minister to defend Canadian workers.

“The government likes to say, ‘We were worried about jobs.’ What was clear from her [Wilson-Raybould’s] statement was they were worried about electoral concerns and a favoured company,” said McLeod.

When asked if he agreed he or someone in his office or cabinet should resign, Trudeau said Canadians will have a choice about who they want to be prime minister and form government in the Oct. 21 general election.

Federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has not called for Trudeau’s resignation, but said he believed Wilson-Raybould due to the level of detail in her testimony and called for a public inquiry.

Trudeau said he welcomed an investigation by the ethics commissioner “to clear the air on this matter.”

Asked if Wilson-Raybould could remain in the Liberal caucus and be allowed to run as a Liberal in the election, Trudeau said he hasn’t had time to review her entire testimony and will do that before making any final decision.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, high-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote — a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

""I'll be fighting for the things that matter to people,"" he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. ""But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.""

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy ""doing favours for corporate friends,"" alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

""From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,"" Singh said.

""It's clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he's not on your side — he's on theirs.""

Under pressure

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP's popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday's meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

""There's a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,"" Cullen said in an interview.

""It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada's first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.""

For his part, Singh told his caucus he didn't imagine that someone like him could ever run to be prime minister.

Jagmeet Singh has secured himself a seat in the House of Commons, and now his sights are set on becoming prime minister.

“We made history today,” Singh told his supporters Monday after winning the federal byelection in Burnaby South. “When I was growing up as a kid, I could’ve never imagined someone like me ever running to be prime minister. Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there: ‘Yes, you can.'”

“It wasn’t very surprising,” political analyst Philippe Fournier said of the result, calling the B.C. seat a “favourable” for New Democrats, It also helps that the Greens didn’t run a candidate in the British Columbia riding, Fournier added.

The win is important for Singh because it provides a platform to share his vision in Parliament. It also gives him an opportunity to debate his biggest political opponents during question period.

But the byelection results weren’t entirely positive for New Democrats. The party did lose their seat in Montreal’s Outremont, the riding former leader Tom Mulcair held since 2007.

“He lost it, but he lost it badly, too,” Fournier said of the Quebec riding. The NDP is now polling at 12 to 14 per cent nationally, a distant third behind the Liberals and Conservatives, according to Fournier.

“It’s really, really bad,” the creator of political blogs 338Canada and Qc125 said of the NDP’s poll numbers. “[Singh] has not really been that convincing.”

Highlighting Canada’s housing ‘crisis’

The new MP will have to find a way to connect with Canadians if he wishes to fulfil his dream of becoming prime minister.

Former NDP national director Karl Belanger acknowledges the key to success for Singh will be showing that he can grow the party.

“He needs to find a way to connect with [voters] and to tell a story that they can relate to,” Belanger said. “So far, he has been unable to establish that kind of narrative.”

Hoping to improve on the 44 seats the NDP won in 2015, Singh may have identified an issue that affects nearly all Canadians.

“Across Canada, people are worried about housing,” Singh told CBC News Network on Tuesday. “People are finding it hard to find a home.”

Vancouver Sun columnist Daphne Bramham says this is a problem that is especially pressing for young people.

“The issue of housing is as important in Regina as it is in Vancouver,” Bramham told Yahoo Canada.

Singh says it’s a “crisis” that is top of mind for many Canadians, among the top three for many he has spoken to. He insists it’s the government’s job to find solutions for problems, and this one could be addressed with more affordable housing.

Thank you #BurnabySouth! I'm determined & ready to fight for the help people need – from the housing crisis to health care not covering everyone the way it should, Canadians deserve better. This isn’t the end of a campaign – it's the beginning of one. See you in Parliament. pic.twitter.com/x8Q1SyHcEU — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) February 26, 2019





Why Quebec may be a challenge

The housing debate is one that could potentially win over millennials, but it may not be enough to regain the support the NDP has lost since the “orange wave” swept across Canada in 2011. Led by Jack Layton, the party became the official Opposition for the first time ever, propelled by strong gains in Quebec.

Fournier sees the Liberals emerging as the big winners if the NDP can’t improve on the 16 seats won in Quebec during the the last election.

“We’ve got lots of great support to build on, we’ve got great MPs that are there,” Singh said, as reported by The Canadian Press.

There’s a potential roadblock in Quebec this time around because of the fact that Singh, a Sikh, wears a turban. Fournier, a Quebec native, says it’s more about religion for Quebecers than it is about race when it comes to voting. After all, this is a province that last year gave a majority mandate to a government that has proposed a ban on public servants wearing religious symbols at work.

“It does turn off many Quebecers,” Fournier admitted.





That may not be as big of an issue for the rest of Canada. In 2017, an Angus Reid Institute poll suggested 56 per cent of Canadians could vote for someone who wears a religious head covering.

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

Leader Joe Byrne is looking forward to national NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh having a better platform for delivering the party message.

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South Monday, earning him a seat in the House of Commons.

""It's good to see him with a seat in the House and he's going to be a great representative for Burnaby South,"" said Byrne.

""It will make a difference. Canadians are going to get a chance to see that progressive alternative.""

'Be that difference'

Byrne said 2018 was a good year for the provincial NDP. He said they now have just over 400 members and they raised a little less than $80,000. He said both numbers are roughly triple what they were in 2017.

Byrne said he is looking forward to presenting the party's platform during an election campaign expected this spring.

""We want to be that difference that includes everybody,"" he said.

""Includes everybody in the wealth that we have, includes everybody in addressing challenges that we have. We don't have to do it perfectly but we do have to engage each other when we build our economy, build our society, and respond to the environmental concerns.""

Byrne said the party is aiming to run a full slate of 27 candidates in the provincial election.

The NDP Leader and incoming MP for Burnaby South was making the media rounds by phone Tuesday morning, presenting his plan to rally the country behind him before the fall general election.

“We want to show people the choices they have,” Singh told the NOW.

He said Canadians can choose between a Liberal government that will uphold the status quo, a Conservative government that doesn’t believe its job is to make people’s lives better, or a New Democratic government that will build housing and implement a universal pharmacare program.

Singh cruised to victory in the Burnaby South byelection Monday, pulling 39 per cent of the vote. Liberal Richard Lee was nearly 3,000 votes behind him, with 26 per cent support. Conservative Jay Shin came in a close third with 22.5 per cent.

Singh thanked the people of Burnaby South, his new neighbours, for their support in a rousing victory speech.

“I will be your champion,” he said. ""I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said he never imagined seeing someone like him running to become prime minister.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes you can,” he said to the raucous cheers of New Democratic supporters assembled at the Hilton Vancouver Metrotown.

After his speech and speaking to media, Singh emceed the victory party. He clutched the mic as he sang along to Post Malone’s Congratulations, taught supporters bhangra dance moves and cheered as his mom danced the twist.

But by the next morning, the NDP leader had clearly put the celebratory mood behind him, with a big task in front of him.

Singh’s party is slumping in the polls at 14 per cent nationally, while the Liberals and Conservatives are neck at 35 and 34 per cent respectively, according to the CBC’s poll tracker aggregate.

The party has also struggled to fundraise, pulling in $5.2 million in 2018, far behind the Conservatives’ $24.3 million and Liberals’ $16.6 million.

The party also didn’t fare well in the other two byelections Monday, losing former leader Tom Mulcair’s Quebec seat and coming in a distant third in Ontario.

Singh said he’s confident he’ll be able to turn the ship around.

“We're going to sharpen our message, which is we do believe that we can make better choices,” he said.

Singh said the NDP will expand on its two central policy issues in the byelection – housing and pharmacare – in the coming months.

Asked whether he would return the party to its socialist roots and away from its more recent centrist election platforms, Singh said he has “staked out some really strong ground” in his vows to build 500,000 units of affordable housing over 10 years and introduce a national universal pharmacare program.”

And he’s not stopping there.

“I want to look towards full comprehensive coverage that includes dental care and eye care,” he said. “I've signaled some of these things, and I'm really excited about what we can do if we make better decisions.”

But will the concerns of Burnaby South residents be forgotten as Singh travels the country in an attempt to revive his party?

“Not at all,” he said, “because the top concerns that people in Burnaby South have raised with me are the top concerns that I'm going to bring to Ottawa, that I’m going to fight on.”

Singh said he’s not sure exactly when he’ll be sworn in as a member of Parliament, but he knows his first day serving in the House of Commons will be March 18 – 217 days before the general election on Oct. 21.

His sights are set high for that day.

“I want to be prime minister, and I will work hard to achieve that goal,” Singh said. “My goal will always be to form government because I feel like that's the way I can make the most positive change in people's lives and build a better country.”",'I want to be prime minister': Singh plans NDP revival after byelection win,Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/i-want-to-be-prime-minister-singh-plans-ndp-revival-after-byelection-win-1.23646443

Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This byelection win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer's increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada's diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the NDP shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the NDP's inevitable demise and Canada's return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal NDP came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien's Liberal wave. Even then, the NDP persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the byelection, the NDP would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh's leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the NDP in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton's leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada's diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, NDP fundraising — already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election — continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh's salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau's progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang One of the challenges for Jagmeet Singh will be to make sure the Liberals don't squeeze out the NDP with progressive voters. Here, Singh and his wife Gurkiran pose with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner in 2018.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the NDP out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this byelection win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the byelection was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the NDP announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh's new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the NDP. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the NDP can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the NDP in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the NDP to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh's early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There's no question that Singh's first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilized members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh's slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this byelection win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut’ Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.

But analysts told The Tyee the true test of Singh’s leadership would be whether he can define the party’s identity in an era of political extremes.

“Friends, you made history today,” Singh told friends, family and supporters in a ballroom in Burnaby’s Hilton Hotel. “When I was growing up, I could have never imagined someone like me running to be prime minister. Guess what, we just told a lot of kids out there that ‘yes you can.’”

In the crowd Singh’s parents beamed with pride while two young teenagers wiped tears from their eyes. Singh won with 39 per cent of the vote. Liberal Richard Lee captured 26 per cent, Conservative Jay Shin 22.5 per cent and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson 10.6 per cent. Voter turnout was about 30 per cent.

During a long, passionate and at times improvised victory speech, Singh shifted back and forth between his identity as the first Indo-Canadian leader of a major political party and an unabashedly left-wing critique of what’s wrong with the country.

“Conservatives and Liberals have rigged the system that works for the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected — not for everyday Canadians,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be this way, we can fix it and we will fix it.”

Singh led the polls all evening, to the delight of his enthusiastic supporters. When NDP MP Don Davies came on stage to announce initial election results he remarked, “there is tremendous energy and excitement in this room tonight.”

Such enthusiasm was not always easy to find during the lead-up to election night. Singh was criticized for his lacklustre performance during a national TV interview with CTV’s Evan Solomon. Some senior NDP members anonymously told CBC that if Singh lost, he’d likely have to resign as leader.

Davies said in an interview Monday night that the byelection victory is a turning point.

“It’s really the flipside of all that chatter about the doomsday scenarios,” Davies said. “I think he’s going to be a decisive winner tonight. I think it’ll put an end to doubts about his leadership and I think every metric will improve, from our polling numbers to our fundraising.”

That might be a tall order, as the NDP is polling below 15 per cent, trailing the Liberals and Conservatives who each have about 35-per-cent support, according to the non-partisan site CalculatedPolitics.

Yet University of Ottawa political theorist and commentator David Moscrop said these low poll numbers may not be as dire as they might seem.

“The NDP is hovering about where’d you’d expect them historically to hover in the polls,” he told The Tyee. “We have this expectation that they ought to be doing better, but that’s a historical anomaly. That’s in part a reflection of the fact that the NDP has done unusually well in recent years. Now they’ve come back down to Earth.”

To return the NDP to the more than 30-per-cent support it enjoyed in mid-2015, he’ll need to define a clear, unapologetic identity for the party, Moscrop said.

For inspiration, Singh could draw from the democratic socialist movements gaining popularity in the U.S. and U.K., he said.

“There’s a bit of a struggle internally, a philosophical struggle as well perhaps a political struggle, over whether [the NDP] ought to make that sharper left turn,” Moscrop said. “They need to decide whether they want to be Liberal-lite, which probably won’t serve them well, or whether they want to run a Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, Corbyn-style campaign.”

This tension isn’t new for the NDP, nor easily resolved.

“This is a perennial debate, this is just the most recent iteration of it,” Stewart Prest, a political scientist at Simon Fraser University, told The Tyee. “Is it a party of principle, which gives a voice to the strongest expression of values that its members can think of, or is it a party that seeks power and tries to make strategic compromises along the way?”

The byelection results offered a preview of another challenge Singh will face heading into the Oct. 21 election. The People’s Party of Canada, which has made open hostility to refugees a core part of its far-right populist platform, won almost about 11 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South.

During one campaign event I attended, Singh said he was “disgusted by some of the values being espoused” by the People’s Party of Canada’s Thompson, who had said more thorough screening of refugees was needed and pointed to the killing of Marrisa Shen as an example of the risks, failing to mention that many Syrian-Canadians have condemned the crime and pleaded for it not to be the basis for a wider refugee backlash.

Prest said Singh, as a highly visible face of Canada’s diversity, is in a good position to fight against politicians who attempt to gain power by stoking racial resentment.

But in doing so Singh could be forced to defend his own cultural background rather than the progressive economic and social policies he stands for — as he has been obliged to do ever since running for the NDP leadership.

“It seems like there may be both an advantage, but also a potential disadvantage for Singh having to play that role,” Prest said.

On Monday night, Singh was obviously enjoying his victory, dancing on stage, grinning and high-fiving supporters, while also reminding them about the long road ahead.

“I’m asking you all to keep this fight going for the next eight months, I need you to be a part of this,” he said as his speech came to a close. “The people at the top and the wealthiest corporations have it way too good for way too long.”",Jagmeet Singh’s Next Hurdle: Define His Party in an Era of Extremes,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/02/26/Singh-Next-Hurdle/

Two New Democrat MPs, who spoke to CBC News on condition of anonymity, were among a small group of caucus members who met with Singh last summer to tell him that a loss in the Feb. 25 byelection would lead to overwhelming pressure on him to resign. They're among a group of nine NDP MPs who tell CBC News they believe Singh would have no choice but to resign if he doesn't win his seat next month.

""We told him going in, way back in June, when this was being contemplated ... that if you do this, this is all-in. It's not like you hope to win this thing. You have to. Your leadership rides on it,"" one MP told CBC News.

""That was understood. There may be some revisionist history going on if he doesn't (win).""

A former top NDP strategist agrees.

""It is self-evident. If you lose a byelection, if you can't win in the People's Republic of Burnaby, where can you win?"" said Karl Bélanger, former national director of the NDP and former principal secretary to ex-leader Tom Mulcair.

""I think Mr. Singh knows that, and I think he is trying to show to everybody that he's going to win that seat and then lead the party in the next election.""

The June meeting took place in a secluded committee room in the basement of Parliament Hill's Centre Block the week the House of Commons adjourned for the summer break.

An 'all-in' gamble

Sources told CBC News that the NDP leader agreed at the meeting that running in the byelection would be an ""all-in"" gamble. Singh, according to the sources, said he was confident of a win, that he believed he would be in his element campaigning in the community.

""So if he fails at his best, in a part of the country we have to do well in — British Columbia in general and Vancouver in particular — I don't know what their argument is to have Singh stay on as leader,"" a senior NDP MP said.

Speaking to CBC News Friday, Singh sidestepped questions about what he might do if he loses his byelection bid, insisting that he's in a good position to win.

""I'm not focused on myself and I know if we work hard, we're going to win here,"" he said. ""We're going to win in Burnaby South because people need us.""

​If Singh has agreed privately that he can't stay on if he fails to secure a Commons seat next month, that would contradict his public stance on the matter. In an interview with Rosemary Barton that aired on CBC's The National on January 20, Singh insisted he would stay on as leader even if he loses the February 25 vote.

""I will be the leader that leads the New Democratic Party into the 2019 election,"" Singh said. ""I'm confident we're going to do well in this riding. We're connecting with people, we're getting a lot of support.""

In total, CBC and Radio-Canada contacted more than half of the 40 members of the NDP caucus. Not all of the caucus members contacted by CBC News replied, but most of those who spoke to CBC say they feel confident Singh will win.

What happens if he loses?

Five declined to comment on what they called a 'hypothetical' scenario. Two caucus members expressed their full support for Singh. Some said they believe the decision to stay or go rests with him.

Caucus members aren't the only ones saying Singh must go if he falls short in Burnaby South. Some non-caucus veterans of New Democrat campaigns agree — although at least one is pointing out that Singh's departure might be the result of a messy process.

""First, a group of party elders would counsel him that the time had come. If he resisted, then a caucus vote — non-binding, but humiliating,"" said the party strategist, who asked not to be named. ""Then a vote by the Federal Council of the NDP.

""Choosing his time to go gives him the benefit of a graceful exit. Being pushed means it would end sadly. Given the crippled Liberal (byelection) campaign, I doubt it will come to that.""

The Liberals recently tapped Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. legislator, to run in the riding after their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned over a controversial campaign post urging Chinese people to vote for her as the ""only"" Chinese candidate.

Singh told a packed room in Ottawa that uncertainties related to those key issues are contributing to people's anxieties and fears about ""falling further and further behind.""

The NDP leader also spoke ominously about the charged rhetoric Canadians may be exposed to in the upcoming election.

""There are some people who are going to use those fears, use those uncertainties and seek to divide us,"" he said. ""They're going to point at... not the folks that are responsible but they're going to point at the people around you. Point at your neighbours, your friends, people who live in your community, your co-workers.""

Watch: NDP leader parties after winning byelection

The former governments responsible for the decisions that have created unequal access to health care and housing ""are the ones we should be pointing at,"" Singh said.

""They've been getting away with it. Well, that's about to change my friends.""

It marked the NDP leader's first caucus address as an elected member of the House of Commons. Singh won Monday's byelection race in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Singh's speech had an election-year ring, painting his rivals as leaders with misplaced priorities.

Singh said he understood Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's appeal in 2015 and how Canadians have ""cut him some slack"" with fixing ""the mess"" left by the previous Conservative government.

""But we all know he's not doing it,"" he said. Weaving in the ongoing SNC-Lavalin controversy, Singh said Trudeau is ""too busy doing favours for his corporate friends instead of working for your families.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is ""going to present the old way,"" Singh said, suggesting the party doesn't have a progressive agenda that reflects concerns people have about housing, healthcare, and student debt.

""The system the Liberal and Conservative governments have built is rigged,"" he said.

' No other person looks physically like him': Broadbent

Singh officially takes his seat in the House of Commons in March, giving him just a few months to polish his debating skills before embarking on the campaign trail later this year.

Also on his to-do list before the upcoming fall vote is to cement the party's election planks. One significant challenge the NDP faces is to differentiate itself from the Liberals to progressive voters.

Both parties are courting voters keen on expanded healthcare coverage. While the NDP has long campaigned for universal pharmacare — Liberals have a plan for limited prescription drug coverage reportedly in the works for the spring budget.

Former NDP leader Ed Broadbent said the Liberals are the party's prime competitor for the progressive vote. He said Singh's enthusiasm and historic credit as Canada's first racialized federal leader give the party an advantage.

""No other person looks physically like him,"" Broadbent told HuffPost Canada. The Broadbent Institute chair is excited by the ""enthusiasm and energy"" Singh has.

""He brings youth, he brings vigour,"" Broadbent said, adding he thinks having Singh finally in the House marks a ""big"" turnaround for the party's fortunes.","Jagmeet Singh Blames Liberals, Tories For Canadians' Fears About The Future",HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/27/jagmeet-singh-blames-liberals-tories-for-canadians-fears-about-the-future_a_23679718/

The former Ontario legislator won a byelection in Burnaby South on Monday, giving him a voice in the House of Commons for the first time since he became NDP leader in the fall of 2017.

The 40-year-old moved to the Metro Vancouver riding with his wife late last year. Everywhere he went when he campaigned, he heard that the top concern was housing, he said.

""What we're committed to doing is immediate action,"" he told a cheering crowd of supporters. ""We're calling for the fast-tracking of investments to build new co-operative housing and non-market housing.""

The NDP is calling for a return to a time when the federal government built housing, he said, adding that in the late 1940s and 1970s, Canada built hundreds of thousands of affordable homes.

""I want to get back into doing that, so people can still dream of and actually achieve the dream of owning a home.""

Despite recent cooling in the market, Burnaby still faces a housing crisis. Renters have faced so-called demovictions, when they are kicked out of older apartments to make way for luxury condos, and sky-high prices are shutting millennials out of buying their first homes.

Singh has proposed measures to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada, challenging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers' tax credit.

He entered his victory party on Monday to jubilant cheers, thumping dance music and chants of ""Jagmeet! Jagmeet!""

""It's a new day,"" he said, beaming. ""I want to promise you something. I will be your champion. I will take each and every one of you with me to Ottawa, where I'll fight for you in the House of Commons.""

Singh said he would also push for universal coverage of prescription medication and action on climate change.

He has faced internal criticism for low fundraising and poor support in the polls, but he said the NDP was ""united"" in the vision of ensuring the government stands up for people and not the powerful and well-connected.

""I've spent time with people at the doorsteps and it's clear to me that all New Democrats are committed to making sure that people in their riding, their voices and concerns are brought to Ottawa. We're all united,"" he said.

""I'm confident that we'll be able to work together on those shared values that we all have. Everyone on my team knows that that's what our job is, to fight for people who don't have a voice.""

It's not the first time a federal New Democrat leader has represented a riding in the city, as Tommy Douglas won a byelection in Burnaby-Coquitlam in 1963 and represented the area until 1968.

""In British Columbia, we haven't had a national leader from out west for a very long time, and for us New Democrats, since Tommy Douglas,"" said Vancouver East MP Jenny Kwan.

Kwan agreed with Singh that ""housing, housing and more housing,"" was the top issue in Metro Vancouver.

""Jagmeet is going to amplify that voice across the country, across the nation, to say how important it is that we actually support the people in our community,"" she said.

Kwan said she has been calling for a national affordable housing program for 25 years, but the Liberal government's initiative is a ""pretend program.""

The government has introduced a 10-year national housing strategy worth $40 billion when investments from provinces, cities and non-profits are factored in. The plan aims to cut homelessness in half, build 100,000 new units across Canada and repair aging affordable housing.

Singh beat Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee in Burnaby South by about 3,000 votes, widening the gap significantly from the 2015 election when the NDP won by about 550 votes.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin placed third, 800 votes behind the Liberals, while the People's Party of Canada candidate had about 10 per cent of the overall vote.

Singh may well be looking to turn the page on the past year and a half. Since he was elected in October 2017, his leadership has been marked by poor polling, lacklustre fundraising and a steady trickle of caucus members making their way toward the exit.

But with Monday’s victory, analysts say, Singh has a fresh chance to make a new impression on Canadians, albeit a little later in the game than he’d probably like. “The chatter is over,” B.C. MP Nathan Cullen told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Mr. Singh’s ability to lead this caucus into the next election is 100 per cent secured.”

Still, his problems aren’t all behind him: a few of his heavyweight MPs, including Cullen, have yet to say if they’ll run again in the next election, and he faces a major obstacle in Quebec, where the NDP lost Outremont, the riding held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007, to the Liberals in another byelection on Monday.

But the timing for a fresh start isn’t bad, said former NDP strategist Farouk Karim. Singh will take his place in the House of Commons while the Liberals are mired in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, and as they table their last budget before this year’s election.

“It’s not often in life that you would have a second chance to make that impression,” Karim said. “And he has that opportunity.”

In his victory speech, Singh worked hard to paint Liberals and Conservatives as interested only in helping their “well-connected corporate friends,” while leaving ordinary Canadians in the lurch. “People should be angry at that, angry at governments in Ottawa that continue to develop a system that puts more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands,” he said, pointing to three issues — affordable housing, pharmacare and climate change — that will likely be pillars of the NDP’s election campaign.

Robin MacLachlan, a former NDP strategist, said there’s an opening for Singh while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is “reeling” from the SNC-Lavalin controversy, which he said has damaged Trudeau’s image “as being on the side of ordinary Canadians.”

“He has an opportunity to position himself as the leader who kind of gets what you’re facing,” he said.

With a seat in the House of Commons, Singh will finally have the chance to face off against Trudeau directly, though with little time remaining before the next election. “I would lower expectations. He’s not going to be 100 per cent from the get-go,” said Karim. “But I think if people see an improvement throughout, that will go a long way.”

Cullen said Singh took a risk in deciding to run for a seat in the Burnaby byelection, and it paid off. “I think Canadians are going to look at us in a new way, and I think Mr. Singh’s confidence is going to be boosted,” he said. “I’m looking forward to how he does.”

Arguably the biggest hurdle Singh now faces is Quebec, where the NDP has recently been polling as low as a dismal eight per cent, and nearly all of the party’s seats seem to be under threat. In a separate byelection on Monday, Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan won the Montreal riding of Outremont, which had been a Liberal stronghold until it was taken by Mulcair in 2007 and became a symbol of the party’s gains in that province.

After Bendayan’s victory, Liberals were quick to declare the death of the Orange Wave that swept through Quebec in 2011 and helped propel the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time. “It’s finished,” Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Just look at the results.”

But Singh played down the loss on Monday, saying the party “always knew that Outremont was going to be a tough riding.”

Karim said he was actually “pleasantly surprised” by the Outremont results, which saw NDP candidate Julia Sánchez finish second with 26 per cent of the vote — disappointing, but not catastrophic, according to Karim.

“I think it’s a little hope that the party can build on,” he said. “Twenty-six per cent is far from over, that’s what I would say to the Liberals.”

Singh, clearly recognizing the importance of building his profile in Quebec, said on Monday that he plans to travel to the province next week. Currently, more than a third of the NDP caucus is from Quebec, but several Quebec MPs have said they won’t run again, including Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, who both made their announcements last week.

MacLachlan said the NDP could attract Quebec voters concerned about climate change, and upset about the Trudeau government’s decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline. Karim said the strong third-place showing of the Green Party in Outremont, which finished with 12.5 per cent of the vote, proves that Quebecers “want answers” on the environment.

Outside Quebec, two other high-profile NDP MPs — B.C.’s Cullen and Murray Rankin — have yet to announce whether they’ll run again in this year’s election. So far, 11 of the 44 NDP MPs elected in 2015 have either resigned their seats or have said they won’t seek re-election.

But MacLachlan said Singh’s win should help “consolidate support” for the leader within and outside his caucus. Now, he said, Singh needs to focus on building his profile from inside the House of Commons.

“He needs to reintroduce himself to Canadians,” MacLachlan said. “He’s been absent from the national conversation about policy, and now they’re going to hear from him.”

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh’s shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP’s orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

Today’s the day, for real this time.

Committee chair and Liberal MP Anthony Housefather said he believes all of Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about what she can and can’t say have been addressed: “I think she now can tell her side of the story.

Not so fast. In another letter to Housefather sent Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould said the freedom the Liberal government gave her to speak through an Order in Council “falls far short of what is required” if Canadians are to learn all the facts. That’s because the order only covered her time as attorney-general, but still limits her from speaking about events that happened after she was shuffled to veterans affairs or what she told cabinet after she resigned.

Even so, she is scheduled to appear starting at 3:15 p.m. ET.

And someone else claims to be looking forward to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, too. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: “I’m pleased that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is going to be able to share her perspective.”

But the 2015 election, which saw the Liberals under Justin Trudeau successfully feint to the left, demonstrated the key limitation of this strategy: it's hard to out-Liberal the Liberals.

Oddly enough, as the NDP continues to try and avoid sounding too left-wing, socialism has become fashionable again in the U.S. and Britain.

In the U.S., seven contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination — including avowed socialist Bernie Sanders — have signed onto something called the Green New Deal. Among other things, it calls for the federal government to provide a good-paying job to whoever wants one.

In Britain, much to the dismay of the right-wing press, young people are attracted to unions, government intervention and old-style democratic socialists like Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

When the LEAP Manifesto, a Canadian precursor of the Green New Deal, came out in 2015, its call for moving immediately to a zero-carbon-emission economy was dismissed as utopian. It now seems prescient.

Where is Singh in all of this? In his successful 2017 bid for the party leadership, he produced policy papers on standard issues, such as the old age pension. But when speaking, he preferred to focus on broad rhetorical themes like love and courage.

During the Burnaby South byelection campaign, he talked of the need for affordable housing, an important issue in Greater Vancouver. Speaking on CBC the day after his victory, he spoke of a policy trifecta: affordable housing, fighting climate change and universal pharmacare.

Perhaps this is where the NDP is going in the upcoming election campaign. If so, it will have to square some circles. In particular, it will need to show how it would reinvent Alberta's entire carbon-based economy in a zero-emission world.

It will also, however, have to be bold. The NDP can only get so far by calling Trudeau's Liberals untrustworthy. It will have to sketch out a compelling but plausible vision of its own. That is the reaffirmed leader's main task.

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday nightwith 39 per cent of the vote – but he is getting a great deal of attention for his rap game on Tuesday.

A huge crowd of supporters turned up to support Singh for this critical moment in his political career. Following the win, elated supporters turned the event room into a dance party.

“I will be your champion,” Singh said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Of course, many people were dancing, but one of the night’s highlights was Singh rapping Post Malone’s “Congratulations.” Not only was he rapping some of the lyrics, but he also passionately pumped up the crowd. In fact, Singh got so into the beat that he started motioning to the crowd to jump when the chorus dropped, and he proceeded to jump on the platform.

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said that when he was growing up, he never imagined seeing someone who looked like him running to be the prime minister of Canada.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes we can,” he said, borrowing a slogan from former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Singh also danced with his parents.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

OTTAWA – Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons’ justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer said. “And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.”

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer’s demand as he touted his government’s record defending jobs and “the independence of our judiciary,” adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould’s testimony underscored his party’s calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau’s inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included “veiled threats” from the country’s top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau’s resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,” Scheer said.

“A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould’s testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events, saying he and his staff “always acted appropriately and professionally.”

He said Canadians will have “a very clear choice in a few months” in the October election about who they want to form government.

“There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that … has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,” he said.

“And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.”

Murray Rankin is the latest NDP MP to announce he won't run in the next election, but he says it has nothing to do with Jagmeet Singh's leadership.

""I will have been doing it for nearly seven years by the time the next election comes along and I think it's time to pass the torch,"" Rankin said in an interview with CBC News.

""I wasn't prepared to spend the next four years doing this. I thought at this stage, I wanted to do other things with my life aside from politics.""

""Not to say this hasn't been the most exciting and rewarding career that I've ever had, but it's time for a change.""

Rankin is the 12th NDP MP out of the 44 elected in 2015 to resign or announce in recent months that they won't run again in October. Others, like B.C. MP Nathan Cullen, have said they are also weighing their futures in politics.

With eight months to the next election, the New Democrats are in third place with an estimated 14.2 per cent of support, compared with 35.8 per cent for the Conservatives and 33.9 per cent for the Liberals.

'People are saying we've got a strong leader'

Rankin said his decision has nothing to do with the party's popularity or the leadership of Singh, who was elected to the House of Commons on Monday in a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

""I think people are saying we've got a strong leader as well and as soon as Canadians get to know him better I think there's going to be an enormous uptick in support, and I think we're in a good position for the next election.""

Rankin said those who are leaving have a variety of reasons.

""Transition happens all the time in a party. I don't think the narrative that people are abandoning the NDP team is really warranted. It's certainly not relevant in my case. That's not the reason I have decided to move on.""

While the NDP has held the riding of Victoria since 2006, Rankin's departure could create an opportunity for Elizabeth May's Green Party.

Rankin was first elected in a byelection in November 2012, narrowly beating a Green Party candidate by less than three percentage points. While he increased his margin of victory in 2015 to more than nine percentage points, Green Party candidate Jo-Ann Roberts was a close second, with the Liberals and the Conservatives lagging far behind.

Rankin's riding also borders May's riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands and is represented provincially by B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver.

While Rankin acknowledges the Green Party posted one of its strongest results across the country in his riding in the last election, he said voters would be better off voting for whoever succeeds him as the NDP candidate — particularly if that candidate is a strong advocate for the environment.

""If you're caring deeply about these issues, where do you think you're going to have the most clout in Ottawa? Being part of a team that may have the balance of power in the next Parliament, the NDP? Or a team that has, so far, one member?""

Unpopular Liberal decisions

Rankin said the riding also has a base of Liberal support but he said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has made decisions that are unpopular in the riding.

""There's a lot of disenchantment with the fact the electoral reform didn't go through. The pipeline issue — I would be lying to you if I didn't say that was an enormous obstacle for the Liberals on Vancouver Island. People are just not prepared to take chances with our coastline.""

Rankin's announcement comes as circumstances have thrust him into the spotlight as a key point person for the NDP in what he describes as a ""constitutional crisis"" — former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's assertion that key government officials pressured her to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with Quebec construction giant SNC-Lavalin which is facing charges of fraud and corruption.

He is also the NDP's deputy house leader and a member of the highly secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

While he plans to serve out his mandate, Rankin has already been appointed by the B.C. government to help guide and design a new reconciliation process with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who have been opposing a natural gas pipeline in Northern B.C. and implement the Supreme Court's Delgamuukw, decision which helped define indigenous title.

""The new government in Victoria, I'm very proud of the fact that they're committed to trying to do things differently. They have, in their speech from the throne, committed to the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous people. They talk about implementing the historic Delgamuukw case and to be given an opportunity to do that is something I couldn't say no to.""

A lawyer by profession, he is also thinking of once again teaching law at the University of Victoria and has been approached by law firms to practice environmental and Indigenous law.

But for now he is focused on completing his mandate and getting to the bottom of the SNC-Lavalin case.

""There's a lot of work to do here. We're living through a constitutional crisis right now in the House of Commons. … We're dealing with issues that are absolutely historic and important so that will take a lot of my time.""

Rankin has been representing Victoria, B.C. since he was first elected in a 2012 byelection. He plans to keep his seat until the end of this Parliament, at which point he says he’s keen to do other things.

""It has been the most rewarding, exciting thing I've ever done, serving as an MP… people writing an 'X' beside your name is something that will live with you forever, "" Rankin told CTVNews.ca ""But I never expected I would do it for the remainder of my career.""

As for what he plans to do next, he was recently appointed by the government of British Columbia to work as the province's representative in treaty renegotiations with the Wet'suwe''en First Nation as the two sides seek to affirm the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people.

Rankin worked for the federal government as a treaty negotiator for years, as well as a lawyer for various Indigenous communities and he thinks he is in a good position to understand both sides through this reconciliation process.

""I want to try to make a contribution in my own way,"" Rankin said. This is in addition to his plans to keep up on other legal matters, including the ongoing fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is strongly opposed in his riding.

Rankin shot down any question that his departure has to do with the current state of the NDP, amid low polling numbers and fundraising troubles.

""It's simply not the case,"" Rankin said. ""I think it's time for a fresh look.""

His departure makes it at least a dozen NDP MPs who have announced they will not be running again, some of which have already vacated their seats. He said this wave of departures allows for party ""renewal.""

He said he is optimistic that the party is ""turning around"" now that leader Jagmeet Singh has clinched a seat in the House. Rankin predicted that once Canadians can see him in the Commons the party’s fortunes will ""dramatically improve.""

During his time on Parliament Hill, Rankin has sat on the House Finance Committee, House Health Committee, the special committee tasked with physician-assisted dying, and is a part of the House Justice Committee that is currently probing the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He's also been the NDP House leader, and is the sole and first NDP MP on the top-secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

Over the last few months he's been pushing the government to pursue expungements for people with past pot possession charges, and not simply pardons, as Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is poised to table imminently. He has presented a private member's bill to this effect and condemned the Liberals' plan as a ""half-measure."" He said he'll see what the bill that Goodale ends up introducing contains, but he’s planning on being disappointed.

Rankin voiced appreciation for the support of his wife, Linda Hannah, and two adult children during his many years of splitting his time between the West Coast and Ottawa.

After seven years representing Victoria in Parliament as a New Democrat, Murray Rankin says he won’t run for re-election this fall.

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the “most rewarding experience” of his life.

“I’ve got to know so many people in our community,” he said. “I’ve got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I’ve really enjoyed that.”

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP’s prospects or Jagmeet Singh’s leadership.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats’ fortunes are “definitely going up,” adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by “significant margins” over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

“It looks to me to be a turning point,” he said. “We will have a leader in the House ... I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he’s done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

“I hope I’ve made a difference,” Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the “constitutional crisis” involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

Rankin was first elected as a federal MP in a 2012 byelection. The two-term MP turned 69 years old earlier this year and thanked Singh and former NDP leader Tom Mulcair in his letter announcing his decision to leave federal politics.

“And of course, I’d like to thank you, the people of Victoria. It has been a privilege to serve and to work with you. I’ve always said I am so fortunate to represent such a compassionate, engaged and progressive riding,” Rankin said “You have been a constant source of inspiration.

At the beginning of February the B.C. government announced Rankin as B.C.’s representative to help guide and design the reconciliation process between the B.C. government and the Office of the Wet’suwet’en.

On Jan. 8, 14 people were arrested in the Wet’suwet’en First Nation for allegedly failing to obey a court injunction that required the removal of a blockade.

The Unist’ot’en Camp was set up years ago to manage entry into the Indigenous territory. A blockade, called the Gitdumt’en access point, was set up further along the road. A December court injunction was granted in favour of Coastal GasLink, ordering protesters to remove the blockade.

Journalists treated to an advance screening at the legislature were thrown for a loop. Expecting to see a horror show, they were instead given the disaster that wasn’t — a reversal of fortune story touted as the unexpected feel-good hit of the season.

The Notley government released its latest financial results Wednesday, updating its performance and projections to include the last three months of 2018 and predicting a $6.9-billion deficit, down from the original $8.8-billion shortfall.

You may recall that was the period during which the words “crisis” and “catastrophe” were frequently on the lips of political leaders, describing the severe price discount Alberta oil was then suffering on the world market.

At times in November, the cost to buy a barrel of Western Canadian Select was roughly equivalent to a movie ticket, popcorn not included. Economists warned that the provincial government stood to lose billions in royalty revenue, wreaking havoc with the Alberta’s already hefty debt and deficit projections.

It was a disaster in the making, not just for the provincial treasury but the NDP’s already faint hopes of hanging onto power.

Journalists, therefore, went to the fiscal update expecting to see a document completely spattered in red ink.

Instead, the update had a remarkably rosy tint.

There was no further financial shortfall. Rather, the deficit figure had actually shrunk, by nearly $1.9 billion from budget time and $600 million from the last quarter.

Expenses had stayed relatively flat. And revenue was up, in part due to better-than-anticipated income tax assessments, but mostly because of unexpectedly buoyant oil royalties.

How was this possible, reporters asked, given all the doom and gloom last fall around bargain basement commodity prices?

Finance officials responded that the wide price differential had, in fact, hurt. But not enough to overtake stronger-than-expected oil prices from earlier in the year, along with a favourable U.S. exchange rate that helps Alberta exports.

As a result of those factors, resource revenue is now projected to be 30 per cent higher than forecast at budget time, they said.

Finance Minister Joe Ceci was also happy to heap praise on Premier Rachel Notley’s decision in December — supported by opposition parties — to reverse the differential by ordering mandatory production cuts for the province’s largest oil companies.

There’s a good chance Wednesday’s update could be Ceci’s last as provincial finance minister.

It’s also likely the final look Albertans will get at the government’s finances prior to the election, since Notley won’t commit to introducing a budget before the writ is dropped.

There’s ample reason to think that’s the case, in part because of Ceci’s decision to include a special Path to Balance insert with the update. The insert, not offered with any previous quarterly report, was included chiefly to show that the NDP continues to have Alberta on track to again be in a surplus position by 2023-24, the minister said.

“And we are doing a great job in getting there without blowing up programs and services,” he said.

You can bet Ceci and the rest of his party will be promoting that message hard during the upcoming campaign, hoping it’s enough to convince skeptical Albertans the Notley government has taken reasonable care of the books during a difficult economic time.

But the Path to Balance also offers considerable fodder to opposition parties, who suggest the NDP’s plan is not so much a feel-good story as it is a tale of fantasy that relies too heavily on big-budget special effects.

In particular, the government’s outlook predicts a relatively weak economy through much of 2019, with just modest GDP growth of 1.6 per cent, and only a tiny improvement in unemployment.

And those numbers could be optimistic. The Conference Board of Canada predicts Alberta’s GDP growth will be a mere 1.3 per cent this year.

Ironically, the same oil production cuts that helped to improve prices for Alberta crude in the short term are simultaneously working to inhibit the provincial economy in the longer term, the board’s latest report said.

Though the NDP outlook suggests economic growth will accelerate in 2020 and beyond, largely due to new pipelines coming online, opposition parties insist the whole thing is based on unrealistic forecasts.

Indeed, the NDP’s path to balance demands that resource income climbs to $12.3 billion in 2023-24, more than double what the province now takes in annually. Similarly, world oil prices must continue to rise without another significant downturn over the next five years, while infrastructure spending stays flat.

But among all the numbers that will be thrown at voters during election season, the UCP and Alberta Party will likely focus on just one: $95 billion.

That’s the jarring debt load the NDP government expects to rack up by the time Alberta is back to a balanced budget.

Get used to it, because you’re about to hear it a lot.

Among all the storylines that will play out during the election, I am particularly curious to see how the NDP writes the script that will get Albertans to look past that debt.

If Notley can pull off a surprise performance of that calibre, she deserves a golden statuette to go with her second term as premier.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, hive-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote – a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

“I’ll be fighting for the things that matter to people,” he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. “But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.”

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy “doing favours for corporate friends,” alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

“From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,” Singh said.

“It’s clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he’s not on your side – he’s on their’s.”

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP’s popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday’s meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

“There’s a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,” Cullen said in an interview.

“It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada’s first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.”

At a public accounts committee Tuesday, auditor Judy Ferguson discussed the ongoing work in response to an motion from Saskatoon Fairview MLA Vicki Mowat, the NDP’s critic for health.

Mowat called for a special examination of the Crown corporation, which handles IT and record keeping for the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA). The agency was embroiled in controversy last year after three employees were fired for taking trips paid for by companies receiving government contracts.

Her motion asked Ferguson to investigate eHealth’s “current contract and tendering process, including whether vendor-sponsored travel led to misuse of public resources.”

Saskatchewan Party committee members used their majority to defeat the motion, after Indian Head-Milestone MLA Don McMorris asked Ferguson to explain what her office is already doing.

Ferguson said she is looking at a number of questions around “eHealth’s policies and procedures to mitigate vendor influence and related conflict of interest” between the dates of April 1, 2017 and Jan. 31, 2019.

“Is the code of conduct and conflict of interest framework sound?” she said during the committee hearing. “Are the policies and procedures for vendor-sponsored travel and training appropriate to avoid vendor influence in procurement decisions?”

She expects to release her findings along with her June report. McMorris said the government is satisfied with that. But Mowat wanted to push for a special investigation that would come back sooner and include more focused information.

The NDP told reporters it has received information from government employees, including staff of SHA and eHealth, as well as physicians who formerly worked with the agency and sources inside vendors.

The sources first came to the party in early 2018, according to the NDP. They continued to provide information even after news of last year’s travel scandal, party staffers said. The concerns raised by the NDP, which have not yet been verified by the Leader-Post, relate to allegations of a culture of waste at eHealth and extend far beyond vendor-sponsored travel.

“We have had seven whistleblowers come forward with different pieces of information that are concerning to the people of this province about how public money is being spent,” Mowat told reporters on Tuesday.

“There’s a whole list of of concerns that have been raised about an organization that is in crisis.”

eHealth responded in a statement, saying it “takes all allegations of wrongdoing very seriously.” The statement said the agency will continue to work with the auditor in “complete transparency.”

It pointed to work that has already taken place following last year’s vendor-sponsored travel controversy, including mandatory code of conduct training, updated procurement policy and criminal record checks.

Ferguson said her current examination was not prompted by allegations conveyed through the NDP. She said her office began the work of its own volition following a management audit at eHealth relating to the three terminated employees.

She said eHealth’s own audit was relatively “narrow.” The agency is becoming increasingly important, in Ferguson’s view, prompting her to launch a more wide-ranging examination of its code of conduct and conflict of interest framework.

But she said her office is unlikely to delve into the culture of the agency.

“Frankly, it’s hard to audit those areas,” she said.

The province’s top civil servant, deputy minister to the premier Cam Swan, has already conducted a review of vendor-sponsored travel throughout government. Swan probed every instance of vendor-sponsored travel at ministries, agencies and Crown corporations over the past two years. He found no examples that didn’t comply with government policy, according to his report.

Released earlier this month, the report recommended policy changes that the province has committed to act on. That will include changes to conflict of interest policy to provide more clarity on vendor relationship and acceptance of gifts, as well as mandatory training for all government employees.

That’s not enough for the NDP. In Mowat’s view, there are still missing pieces of the eHealth puzzle.

“I think there’s still many unanswered questions that we need to get into the bottom of,” she said, “and the provincial auditor wouldn’t be looking into it if that wasn’t the case.”

The NDP released their response after Wilkinson gave his take on the government’s approach on protecting renters during a budget debate in the legislature, saying he was a renter for 15 years.

“I lived in dozens of rentals. It was challenging at times but it was fun, it was part of growing up and getting better. We’ve all done it,” Wilkinson said.

“It’s kind of a wacky time of life but it can be really enjoyable. Being a renter is a fact of life, it’s a rite of passage.”

“Andrew Wilkinson is showing that he just doesn’t understand the challenges faced by regular British Columbians,” West End – Coal Harbour NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert said in a statement.

“Renting is not just a wacky and fun phase for most people, especially after the BC Liberals let the cost of home ownership skyrocket for years. Now Andrew Wilkinson is proposing to increase rents further, making life even harder and more expensive for renters.”

He attended the FSIN Winter Assembly and spoke about the challenges facing First Nations people in the province, and then toured the region in order to meet people in the Yorkton area and discuss their concerns.

Meeting with the FSIN, he knows there are big gaps in health outcomes, income, justice and education. He believes that there is a big role to play for the province, connecting the federal, provincial and First Nations governments together to bridge those gaps and work together towards shared outcomes.

article continues below

“There is a model that does that in Australia that I think is quite interesting. Once a year, there is a closing the gap report that is released, that tells the story of what is going on, and then the Prime Minister gets up and gives a speech called the Closing the Gap address, that says what the facts are and what is being done. That’s a process that I would like to implement here.”

The NDP is responding to a slow down in certain industries in Saskatchewan, especially in construction. He notes that the PST that now applies to construction is making it difficult for many projects to get started, leading to a slowdown within the industry.

The party is also focused on mental health. Meili said that they hear about a shortage of professionals in the field and a lack of access wherever they go, which concerns them as they travel the province.

Meili believes there is a growing appetite for change in the province, and he wants to put forward ideas that appeal to people. He points to the NDP’s Renewing Saskatchewan plan - which works with rural areas to transition to renewal energy.

“We want to help with those upfront dollars so their bills go down right away, they pay it off as they save and eventually their bills are next to nothing, or they’re making money because they’re selling power back to the grid. We think that’s a great way to make life more affordable while at the same time make lots of jobs.”

Their goal is also to get out of Saskatoon and Regina, and he admits that the NDP has not spent enough time in rural Saskatchewan until now.

He understands how easy it is for parties to get stuck in cities like Saskatoon and Regina, but said it’s not a very effective strategy, and you’re missing out on serving the people of the province who are looking for representation. He believes that the current government has neglected the rural areas with decisions like getting rid of STC, so they want to present an alternative and respond to rural needs.",NDP leader visits FSIN winter assembly,Yorkton This Week,https://www.yorktonthisweek.com/news/ndp-leader-visits-fsin-winter-assembly-1.23647116

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the ""most rewarding experience"" of his life.

""I've got to know so many people in our community,"" he said. ""I've got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I've really enjoyed that.""

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP's prospects or Jagmeet Singh's leadership.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats' fortunes are ""definitely going up,"" adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by ""significant margins"" over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

""It looks to me to be a turning point,"" he said. ""We will have a leader in the House ... I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.""

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October's election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec's Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.'s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver's mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he's done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

""I hope I've made a difference,"" Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the ""constitutional crisis"" involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

Prior to becoming a politician, Rankin worked as a law professor and practising lawyer with expertise in public and environmental law.

During a debate on the 2019 budget, Wilkinson was criticizing the government’s policy on rentals, claiming it would lead to fewer landlords and a reduction in supply. He also said the NDP’s moves to “protect the renters” were misguided.

“I was a renter for 15 years,” Wilkinson told the house. “I lived in a dozen different rentals. It was challenging at times, but it was fun. It was part of growing up and getting better. We've all done it. It's kind of a wacky time of life, but it can be really enjoyable.”

Wilkinson also went on to accuse the government of “pandering” to renters by promising a renters rebate that has yet to materialize.

Within hours, NDP operatives and ministers took to social media and slammed Wilkinson’s comments, pointing out renting can be stressful and, increasingly, expensive.

Thursday, the same messaging was heard in the legislature hallways from Housing Minister Selina Robinson. Robinson also defended her government’s actions on the rental file, claiming the NDP minority government was cleaning up the mess left behind by the Liberals, even as the government has as of yet failed to deliver on a key election promise of a $400 a year renters’ rebate.

Wilkinson appeared to clarify his comment on Twitter Thursday in a thread trying to assure people he understood the challenges faced by renters.

A tweet from his account reads in part, “I know what it feels like to worry about making ends meet each month. I know what it feels like to dream of a better situation, more choice and freedom in life.”

He also went on to criticize the government’s record on job creation, saying that’s why better jobs and homes were out of reach.

Responding to a question about whether the government would fully implement recommendations from a Rental Task Force report last year, Premier John Horgan also made mention of the comments.

“How out of touch can one be to think that renting a home is a rite of passage or a phase that one goes through?,” Horgan said.

He said the government would work with the task force, but stopped short of saying the suggestions would be fully implemented.

UBC Press (2017)

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh’s win with 38-per-cent of the vote in Burnaby South is, of course, a big event for him and his party.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut’ Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.

But it may be even more significant for the Liberals and Conservatives, because it could portend the end of one or the other.

In The Canadian Party System, University of British Columbia political science professor Richard Johnston argues that, after almost a century, the Liberals as a centrist party are on their way out, and the Conservatives face endless factional warfare.

Johnston has studied Canadian elections most of his life. Despite long passages of technical analysis, his book is likely to be a bible in every political campaign for many elections to come. Whether it will actually affect the outcomes remains to be seen; he himself says Canada is changing rapidly from what it once was.

Johnston shows little interest in the immediate details of any particular election, or the virtues of any individual leader. He looks at our politics as a very long game indeed, one that began late in the 19th century and is still underway in the 21st under the same basic rules. He analyzes elections like a forensic accountant, by crunching numbers into a fine powder to distinguish the slightest shift.

Johnston’s theme is Duverger’s Law and Canadian politics’ refusal to obey it. Maurice Duverger was a political scientist who in the 1950s and ’60s argued that majoritarian democracies — those using first-past-the-post elections — tend to have only two parties.

These might begin as liberal and conservative, but as such countries industrialize a labour party emerges as well. Liberals and conservatives then work out some kind of co-operation against the leftist threat, from coalition to outright merger. If that fails, one old-line party destroys the other, or both succumb to an “insurgent” right-wing party bringing a plague on both their houses.

In the process, one party claims the right of centre and the labour party becomes the official left. The centre remains empty.

Except in Canada, where the federal Liberals hold that ground.

Duverger’s Law operates pretty reliably on the provincial level. B.C. is a good example: the rise of the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation provoked a Liberal-Conservative coalition that held power through the 1940s before it fell apart and the insurgent Social Credit party replaced it. When the Socreds began to decay in the 1980s, a new Liberal party emerged and, hijacked by refugee Socreds, soon moved rightward.

But provinces are singular polities. Federally, Johnston argues, Canada has been two polities: Quebec and everyone else. Quebec tends to vote overwhelmingly for one party — usually the Liberals. That reliable base puts the Liberals halfway to a majority. They can even lose much of the rest of the country and still survive as a minority centrist government.

This puts the Conservatives in a predicament. Once in a great while the Liberals lose their grip on Quebec. Even if the Conservatives don’t get most of Quebec’s vote, they have a good chance of taking power anyway as a third party emerges. Diefenbaker, Mulroney and Harper all succeeded when Quebec fell out of love with the Liberals.

These successes turn out to be Conservative Pyrrhic victories, followed by disasters that leave them worse off than ever. In 1993, the Tories had a near-death experience when they were reduced to just three MPs. At the turn of the century, they were taken over by the insurgent Reform/Alliance, who rebranded themselves Conservatives positioned well to the right of centre.

Slow-motion train wreck

The elections of 2006, 2008 and 2011 were a slow-motion train wreck for the Liberals. By 2011 Duverger’s Law seemed to be working against them. The Bloc Québécois held the province as the Conservatives on the right and the rising NDP on the left began to crush the Liberal centre out of existence — very much as Stephen Harper had long dreamed.

Justin Trudeau wrecked that dream in 2015 simply by regaining Quebec at the expense of the Bloc and the NDP. While leading a third party in Parliament he’d called for proportional representation, which would at least give each party a reasonable number of seats. But once in power with a comfortable majority, Trudeau became a first-past-the-post majoritarian again; under PR, he’d have had nowhere to go but down.

Trudeau and his advisers may have understood something that Johnston discusses at length: insurgent parties on the left soon stabilized around the CCF/NDP, but insurgents on the right are far more volatile. They deserted the Progressive Conservatives to launch Reform, which Harper then led to a hostile takeover of the Red Tory rump.

Since Harper’s departure, the right has turned on itself again, with Maxime Bernier defecting to form the People’s Party on the right of the Conservatives. This right-wing volatility can only help the centrist Liberals.

Insurgencies must grow or die

One problem for insurgencies is regionalism. When part of the country feels hard done by, insurgents seize their chance. They can gain seats because their votes are concentrated, but they must grow or die. Prairie movements like the Progressives and United Farmers of Alberta were soon absorbed or crushed, often by other insurgencies like Social Credit.

The CCF was just another group of disgruntled western labour and farm groups. The right in B.C. and the Prairies responded with coalitions or new parties like Bible Bill Aberhart’s Alberta Socreds. Still, the CCF hung on and even took power in Saskatchewan under Tommy Douglas in 1944. Equally important, it proved it could grow beyond its region into Ontario, if not into Catholic, Duplessis-ruled Quebec.

Like the Liberals and Conservatives, the New Democrats have had their near-death experiences. Still, they keep crawling back from the brink. They have missed power largely because they seem less electable, even to their own supporters, than the Liberals and Conservatives.

Yet, Johnston says, the NDP’s “dominant upward trend has been the complement of a correspondingly gradual decline of the Liberal Party.” The ideological gap between Liberals and New Democrats narrows, while that between Liberals and Conservatives widens.

Trudeau’s Lost Opportunity to Build a Better Democracy read more

In his conclusion, Johnston surprisingly says, “Many key claims in this book no longer hold. Quebec has ceased to be the pivot for government.” No longer monolithic, Quebec is up for grabs. The Green Party may be a new kind of insurgency waiting to break out nationwide.

Moreover, Johnston argues, the old identity politics — British/French, Protestant/Catholic, workers/managers — have faded. In their place is a new identity politics of multiculturalism, immigrants, demographics and gender. Perhaps the Liberals can master this new politics, but the New Democrats are ahead of them even in their choice of leader.

“Having ceased to benefit from domination of Quebec,” Johnston suggests, “the [Liberal] party should now face a squeeze between parties with more natural anchors in civil society.”

If that squeeze does continue, and the NDP crowds ever closer, the Liberals may indeed vanish. Or the Conservatives will collapse into an insurgent civil war, and the Liberals will rush to the right to take their place.

Either way, Duverger’s Law will at last hold as true in Canada as it does in other majoritarian democracies.","The NDP’s Slow Rise, and Why the Liberals and Conservatives Can’t Both Survive",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2019/02/27/NDP-Slow-Rise/

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut’ Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.

What difference does it make whether the British Columbia budget comes from an NDP government or from a BC Liberal administration?

Actually, quite a lot.

Or perhaps not so much.

It depends on your perspective and what you value, according to four former finance ministers interviewed by The Tyee following the introduction of the latest provincial budget last week.

Former NDP finance minister — and ex-Premier — Glen Clark and Paul Ramsay, another B.C. NDP finance minister, definitely disagree on some fundamental aspects of budgets with Kevin Falcon and Colin Hansen, both former BC Liberal finance ministers.

But they also agree on some issues.

What is clear is that each budget is a battleground of politics, priorities and ideology.

Where the province will spend what now amounts to $58 billion a year indicates what is important to the party in power. What gets left out or denied increased funding shows that party’s disinterest or, at best, benign neglect.

Clark has a unique perspective. He’s president and CEO of the Jim Pattison Group, Canada’s second largest private company with over $10 billion in annual sales.

But when Clark was NDP finance minister under then-Premier Mike Harcourt from 1991 to 1993, employment and investment minister from 1993 to 1996, and as Premier from 1996 to 1999, parts of the B.C. business community were often highly antagonistic to his decisions.

Now Clark is one of the leading figures in that community.

And his view of the difference between the left and the right parties in B.C. — the NDP and BC Liberals who succeeded the Social Credit Party — is clear. (Full disclosure: I was communications director in Clark’s premier’s office in 1996 and currently consult with companies in the Jim Pattison Group.)

“Philosophically, BC Liberals believe in smaller government and lower taxes, especially for business,” Clark told me. “They believe in the trickle-down theory — that what’s good for business is good for the province.”

“The NDP comes at budgets with a more social justice perspective — how can they help people who can’t help themselves.”

“Even within ministerial budgets, there are important differences,” Clark said.

Clark does note that about 50 per cent of spending is effectively locked in each year. Health and education are the largest budget commitments and require inflationary increases for labour costs each year, with governments rarely doing much to change that other than attempt to restrain wages.

Hansen, finance minister under BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell in 2004-2005 and 2008-2011, said provincial budgets are remarkably similar no matter which party is in power. Hansen is now a director of AdvantageBC, a non-government organization dedicated to promoting British Columbia as a place for international business.

“I think most people who look back through the past 30 years of budgets will be struck by how much they all have in common rather than being unique,” Hansen told me.

“There is not a lot of difference in the last Socred budget documents to the first NDP budget in 1992. Or from spring of 2001 to fall of 2001 under the BC Liberals. Same this time with the change of government. The format does not change very much,” Hansen said.

“The only document that is not really part of the ‘budget template’ is the finance minister’s speech, which is more of a political document than the rest of the material that is tabled on Budget Day,” he adds.

But Hansen does agree there are some differences that matter and reflect the relative weight each party places on its priorities.

“Both the NDP and the BC Liberals try to position their budgets to appeal to their base while making sure that at least lip service is paid to every issue du jour,” Hansen said. “So the BC Liberal budget speeches are long on the economic message and the NDP speeches focus more on social programs.”

“The BC Liberal budgets were driven by an obsession to avoid deficits — that said, of the five budgets that I tabled, I only got one without a deficit — and to increase and then maintain the credit rating,” he said.

While Hansen sees far less differences in budgets than Clark, Kevin Falcon who was Hansen’s successor as Liberal finance minister, has a somewhat different view — one critical of the last Liberal government of Premier Christy Clark and finance minister Mike de Jong.

“I may get in trouble with some BC Liberals, but I support some of the elements of BC NDP spending. I can live with welfare increases and childcare spending, for example,” Falcon told me in an interview. Falcon is now executive vice-president for the Anthem Capital Corporation, an investment firm focused on real estate, mining and energy, technology and consumer products.

“I realized after the BC Liberals second-last budget right away that they were in trouble — there was no significant investment in the things people were concerned about, like housing. It was a ‘don’t worry, be happy’ attitude,” Falcon said. “They totally missed it 100 per cent.”

Indeed, de Jong was criticized externally and within the BC Liberal Party when he introduced a budget with very little additional social program spending before the 2017 provincial election — and ended up with a $2.7-billion surplus.

While de Jong did not respond to an interview request, he has defended himself against critics in the past.

“I’m not going to apologize for B.C. becoming number one under our watch as government and my watch as finance minister,” he said in 2018.

The NDP, with support from three Green MLAs, ousted Clark’s government in a dramatic confidence vote in June 2017 and continue to maintain a narrow majority in the legislature, in part because voters want to see more done on housing, health, education, childcare and social programs.

That’s Paul Ramsey’s view as NDP finance minister from 1999 to 2001. Like Hansen, Ramsey sees some similar aspects in budgets from different parties, but also important differences.

“Recent Liberal budgets and NDP budgets have some things in common. They are based on conservative estimates of economic growth. They built in lots of ‘prudence’ — contingency funds, unallocated program expenditures, cautious revenue estimates — to ensure a higher probability of hitting their budget targets,” Ramsey told me.

“And they are quite transparent about the risks to both revenue and spending estimates. These are all good things.

“However, they differ dramatically in how they deal with surpluses. By and large, BC Liberal budgets focus on using surpluses to pay down debt and reduce taxes,” says Ramsey, a former political scientist at the University of Northern BC who also served as health minister and education minister.

“Their ultimate goal is, of course, to shrink the size of government. And they believe that lower taxes will strengthen the economy and eventually trickle down and help individuals. Large spending initiatives are a rare event.”

“NDP budget surpluses are also used to pay down debt and to reduce fees and government charges on individuals. But unlike the Liberals, the NDP focuses on using surpluses to improve government services. They believe that government programs can improve peoples’ lives, strengthen communities, and diversify the economy,” Ramsey concludes.

And when it comes to spending on government programs, Finance Minister Carole James, in her second full budget, delivered on its title — “Making Your Life More Affordable” — with significant spending that includes:

A new Child Opportunity Benefit worth $1,600 for one child, $2,600 for two and $3,400 for three;

Elimination of Medical Services Plan premiums by Jan. 1, 2020;

Ending interest on postsecondary student loans;

A $50 increase in disability benefits and income assistance rates, following a $100 increase in 2017 — the first welfare hike after a frozen decade of rates under the Liberals; and

Increased spending on childcare, health care, education, and a CleanBC program to reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change, among other features of the budget.

“The past government made the choice to make life easier for the few at the top, at the expense of everyone else. People were told they had to choose between a strong economy or investments in people. But the truth is, we can and must have both,” James said in her budget speech. “Under the last government, health and education were underfunded and neglected.”

But the BC Liberal view of James’s budget has been less charitable.

“This government’s actions have raised the cost of living and jeopardized the economic growth on which the NDP has pinned all hopes of paying for their spending spree going forward,” Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson wrote in a Vancouver Sun op-ed article. “You’ll have less money to spend and it will be harder than ever for those struggling with the affordability crisis to secure their futures.”

And notwithstanding his acceptance of increased NDP spending on social programs, Falcon also has some negative things to say about James’ budget — and a warning for the government.

“The current government has the benefit of inheriting an enviable financial situation, but they are not sending the right signals to investors, to people who will put money into B.C. and create jobs,” Falcon says, referencing what he calls a “blizzard of fees and taxes” introduced since the NDP took office.

“It isn’t one thing that kills you in government — it’s the cumulative effect. Yes, they’re hitting the right notes for social investment, but there’s nothing for investors in the economy.”

“The NDP have ironically made expensive homes more affordable to the wealthy [with new taxes forcing prices down], but not lower prices for townhomes and condos — those prices are going up as a result,” Falcon said.

“Luxury vehicles — and I get the NDP don’t give a shit about this sector — but it’s revenue to the government that disappears when people stop buying them,” he added.

Falcon’s advice for the NDP is clear — be careful not to discourage investment.

“Capital is so mobile now, much more than when I first got into politics,” he said, noting that mining and other companies are not looking at B.C. for projects because of taxes, environmental regulations and uncertainty around Indigenous rights.

Ramsey didn’t comment specifically on the NDP budget. But he noted the different views of BC Liberals like Falcon and Hansen can translate into serious lurches from left to right and back as governments change.

“The problem with these diametrically opposed views is that it can create instability and uncertainty — a sense of whiplash as taxes rise and fall, programs come and go,” Ramsey said.

Glen Clark noted that impact as well.

“The 25 per cent individual tax cut by Gordon Campbell in 2001 drove the province into a huge deficit, and then came major service cuts.”

So is there an elusive magic formula for finance ministers and governments, both left and right, with the perfect balance of social spending, taxes and encouragement of investors to create jobs and stimulate the economy while meeting the needs of all British Columbians?

Unlikely.

But Kevin Falcon ended our interview on a surprisingly hopeful note.

“I get more pragmatic as I get older. There is a happy common ground that can be found,” he said.

After 16 months without a seat in the Commons — and dire warnings from within his own party that he'd either win the seat or find himself looking for another job — the NDP leader defied his critics and the pundits by capturing Burnaby South.

""To Burnaby South, thank you for trusting me to be your member of Parliament,"" a jubilant Singh told the crowd at his election headquarters.

Singh led throughout the night over his main rivals, Conservative candidate Jay Shin and the Liberals' Richard Lee.

Some will still suggest that Lee, a long-time provincial politician, had too much ground to make up after the Liberals original choice was forced to resign mid-campaign after making remarks in Mandarin about Singh's ethnicity that were considered offensive.

Some Liberals even suggested, privately, that a Singh victory wouldn't be such a bad thing for them given his uneven performance as leader, and their hopes of repeating their success poaching NDP supporters in 2015.

Whatever the reason, Singh is now poised to take a seat in the House of Commons — poised, finally, to begin shifting the discussion away from his embattled leadership to the issues the party intends to champion in the few months remaining before the fall general election: affordable housing, pharmacare and real action to combat climate change.

'National stage'

""With this win, people will get to see a progressive alternative to Justin Trudeau,"" said James Smith, Singh's campaign spokesperson. ""Conservatives won't push for more affordable housing, or for universal pharmacare. Jagmeet gets a chance now to stand up for those values on the national stage.""

That's the good news for the NDP. Good news for the party these days, however, always seems to come mixed with the bad.

In this case, New Democrats have to balance Singh's personal win against the loss of Outremont, the closest thing the party had to a fortress in Quebec. The Liberals resoundingly reclaimed the Montreal riding held by Singh's predecessor, Tom Mulcair, for the past decade.

Mulcair's 2007 byelection win gave the New Democrats a beachhead in Quebec. It was only the second time a New Democrat had ever won a seat in the province.

Four years later, Outremont became the epicentre of the so-called Orange Wave that swept across Quebec, giving the NDP nearly 60 seats there and vaulting it into the official opposition in Ottawa for the only time in its history.

Still, Monday's result in Outremont was not unexpected. For the Liberals, winning in Burnaby South would have been significant — more of an indication of momentum, especially in the wake of two weeks of negative media coverage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Watch as Singh addresses supporters after his byelection win:

In Quebec, opinion polls have unblinkingly recorded the decline in NDP support ever since Singh became leader. As it stands, the party might have trouble holding a single one of its 16 — make that 15 — seats in the province after Monday night.

Battle for momentum

Liberals insist the win in Outremont is a good omen for them, a clear indication that they are on track to increase their seats in a province that may well be decisive to their chances of winning a second term.

Outremont is also the third byelection in which the Trudeau Liberals have taken an opposition seat, joining Lac Saint Jean, Que., and South Surrey-White Rock, B.C. Both had been held by Conservatives.

Conservative Scot Davidson will be the next MP for the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe. (CBC)

The Conservatives, as expected, won handily in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe. And they did so despite the presence of candidates from Maxime Bernier's maverick People's Party of Canada.

The PPC did surprisingly well in Burnaby South. The party's candidate took about 11 per cent of the vote there, most of it from the Conservatives. In the other two races, Bernier's candidates barely registered.

What does that mean? Possibly very little. But Conservatives will have to consider the potential impact of vote-splitting with the People's Party this fall in swing ridings, where even a small amount of vote bleeding just might mean the difference between them and the Liberals.

But the big story of the night remains Burnaby South.

Watch as Singh calls for change after his byelection win:

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

The prevailing wisdom was that Singh would have a tough time winning the riding for any number of reasons.

Start with the results in 2015, when the NDP won Burnaby South by fewer than 600 votes. Add in the fact that Singh's political home, until recently, was halfway across the country in Ontario. His political experience was based on his time in provincial politics there.

The polls have been similarly unkind since he became leader in October 2017. NDP fortunes took a tumble with each Singh stumble, whether it was not knowing the party's position on a gun control bill or his decision to boot MP Erin Weir from caucus after complaints that he made women feel uncomfortable.

The party's fundraising has also been weak, with the NDP lagging far behind the other two major parties. And just to finish the pile-on, let's observe that fully a quarter of the current NDP caucus isn't running again.

That made Burnaby South an interesting choice for a rookie leader who had what appeared to be everything to lose in this race.

But it proved to be a good laboratory for testing the tolerance of progressive voters in one of this country's most diverse ridings. Half of the people who live there were born outside Canada.

It's also exactly the kind of riding Justin Trudeau has cultivated, said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the polling firm Angus Reid Institute, with tax hikes on the rich, the tax-free child care benefit and promises of new money for infrastructure.

""This is middle-class ground zero, middle-class central,"" said Kurl. ""This will be a good assessment of whether people think Justin Trudeau's delivering or not.""

Three byelections. Three winners from three different parties. For the candidates, an exciting conclusion to three exhausting campaigns. And the winners, at least, will get to do it all over again in just a few months' time.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their sweep of Quebec.

Since those heady days, the party has fallen back to its traditional third-party status. It won just 44 seats in the 2015 election, 16 of them in Quebec. Monday’s loss of Outremont gives credence to polls that suggest the party risks being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was “a disappointment.”

“What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we’re going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,” she said.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said the party will build support in the province by championing the environment and opposition to pipelines.

Singh, who had been serving as NDP leader since 2017 without a seat in Parliament, won one of the night’s other byelections.

With most polls reporting, Singh captured Burnaby South with more than 38 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Liberal contender with 26 per cent and the Conservative with 22 per cent.

Had he lost, Singh would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader. Going into Monday’s byelection, many New Democrats — including Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair — had questioned how Singh could lead the party in the October federal election if he couldn’t win a seat for himself.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

There were, however, a couple of potentially bad omens for the Conservatives in Monday’s results.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections and results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won no more than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won about 11 per cent of the vote after running on a “Canadians first” campaign that was denounced by some supporters of rival candidates.

And in Outremont, the Conservative candidate ran a distant fifth with just seven per cent of the vote, behind the Liberals, NDP, Greens, and Bloc Quebecois.",Liberals retake Outremont in byelection as NDP endures a mixed night,Montreal Gazette,https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/liberals-retake-outremont-from-ndp-in-byelection

Did you ever think you would see a day when you would say that about this province? That, except for the Atlantic provinces, which have chronically high unemployment, Alberta has the worst unemployment in the country.

The national unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent. Ours is 6.8.

British Columbia’s rate is 4.7 per cent. That’s the best in Canada. So it’s easy for them to hold up a pipeline that would create so many jobs here, because times are already good in B.C.

Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba all have jobless rates of 5.6 per cent.

Alberta is even 1.4 percentage points worse than Quebec. I don’t ever recall there being a period in my lifetime when Alberta had a worse unemployment rate than Quebec.

Our job creation is shameful. In December we shed 15,000 jobs, mostly full-time and mostly in the private sector. In January, we lost another 16,000.

And it’s almost entirely the fault of the provincial NDP and federal Liberal governments. Their carbon taxes, environmental regulations, long delays in approving new projects and increased business and personal taxes have scared away tens of billions of dollars in investment (as well as the small businesses and new jobs that go with all that money).

For a contrast, look at the oil states in the U.S. where there aren’t “green,” socialist governments putting up roadblocks at every step and squeezing out what little blood is left in the golden goose.

North Dakota has an unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent, Oklahoma’s is 3.2 per cent, Utah’s 3.2 per cent and Texas is 3.7.

On Wednesday, provincial Finance Minister Joe Ceci released his third-quarter fiscal update. The deficit for the current fiscal year (which ends on March 31) is expected to be almost $2 billion less than the NDP projected in their budget last spring. But that’s about where the “good” news ends.

Put that deficit into context, though. Yes, at $6.9 billion, the 2018-19 deficit will be $1.9 billion lower than forecast. Yet it would still be the largest deficit in Alberta history were it not for the NDP’s first three deficits.

Interestingly, in making his third-quarter announcement, Ceci said the economy might be a little tight in 2019, but will “bounce back to 2.9 per cent in 2020 and remain solid over the medium term.”

What rubbish. So long as the NDP remain in office with their Climate Leadership Plan, their rapidly expanding public sector, their refusal to cut spending, their ballooning debt, higher taxes and anti-development “green” regulations, Alberta’s economy will never recover.

On the same morning as Ceci released his budget update, the Conference Board of Canada revised Alberta’s growth projection from 2.0 per cent this year to just 1.3 per cent.

At 1.3 per cent growth, Alberta will be DEAD LAST among provinces. The worst. Rock bottom.

No wonder Ceci didn’t mention this year’s rate specifically.

For months, Premier Rachel Notley and her ministers having been boasting that Alberta has had the highest growth rate in Canada for the past two years, that we are well on the way to recovery. Now that we have the worst growth (and could possibly dip back into recession) how are the New Democrats going to put a shine on that — especially because it is mostly the fault of their policies and their coziness with the Trudeau Liberals?

The Conservatives easily won a safe Ontario seat. The Liberals brought a Quebec seat back into their traditional fold, and the leader of the NDP handily won a seat in B.C.

Canadians will finally get to take the full measure of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh in the House of Commons, a prospect that worries Liberals hardly at all despite the certain knowledge that their greatest political threat is a resurgent NDP.

That’s because Singh’s performance during the 16 months he’s led the New Democrats has been, to be charitable, uneven. He’s been at odds with the party’s parliamentary caucus and at times he appeared poorly informed on key issues.

But his major handicap was his absence from Parliament and from regular interaction with his caucus. With that hurdle gone, Singh now has about eight months until the federal election to make or break his political future.

The Liberals tend to dismiss Singh as a political light-weight, but he is untested. Whether Singh will rise to the occasion or fall and take the NDP’s electoral fortunes with him remains to be seen.

With the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Liberals may have handed both the Conservatives and the NDP a gift that keeps on giving.

Jody Wilson-Raybould will finally tell her story to the Commons’ justice committee Wednesday and she’s asked for and been given 30 minutes for an opening statement. She obviously has a good deal to say.

Canadians now know that, even after the director of public prosecutions determined that SNC-Lavalin would not be offered a deferred prosecution, discussions on the matter continued between senior officials in the Prime Minister’s Office and then-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Those discussions included the dire prospects for the company and its thousands of employees if Lavalin is convicted on corruption charges and banned from federal contracts for a decade.

SNC-Lavalin didn’t get the sought-after deferral and in January, after Scott Brison’s retirement forced a cabinet shuffle, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau moved Wilson-Raybould to Veteran’s Affairs.

The Conservatives and New Democrats draw a straight line from what they claim was pressure on Wilson-Raybould to give SNC-Lavalin the deferral, her refusal to do so and her removal from the justice portfolio. She later resigned from cabinet after the prime minister seemed to suggest that her continued presence at the cabinet table was proof that nothing inappropriate had occurred.

Monday night, Trudeau’s cabinet freed Wilson-Raybould from whatever limits cabinet confidentiality or solicitor-client privilege might have imposed on her, clearing the way for her appearance at the committee and, they hope, to start the process of putting the affair behind them.

The controversy has already cost the government two resignations — Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts — and absent an unlikely exoneration from Wilson-Raybould, this controversy isn’t going anywhere soon.

The spectre of the “boys” in the PMO pressuring and then demoting Wilson-Raybould, who attained higher national office than any aboriginal Canadian before her, won’t sit well with the left-of-centre voters Trudeau attracted in 2015. Progressive voters disillusioned by the Liberals look next to the NDP.

The Liberals are in a virtual dead heat with Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives in national polls. The Liberals are well ahead in Quebec and Atlantic Canada. The Conservatives have a similar lock on the Prairies. Ontario and British Columbia are battlegrounds.

A competitive NDP would cost the Liberals votes and seats, mostly by splitting the left-of-centre vote and handing seats to the Conservatives.

Singh, an Osgoode Hall-trained lawyer, has been on point with his statements on the SNC-Lavalin affair. He is now battle-hardened in a byelection that, for a time, seemed to be slipping away from him. He’s honed his messages on affordable housing, universal drug coverage and investing in the green economy.

Unlike his predecessor Thomas Mulcair, who was supposed to be Canada’s first NDP prime minister, Singh does not have to worry about meeting high expectations. His job is to pry his party’s natural constituency away from Trudeau’s Liberals.

If he gets that done, he’ll likely survive to lead the NDP in more than one election, and in the process could cost the Liberals their majority, if not a second term in power.",VIBERT: Lavalin affair could give new life to federal NDP,The Telegram,https://www.thetelegram.com/opinion/columnists/vibert-lavalin-affair-could-give-new-life-to-federal-ndp-287803/

That’s the paradoxical message being delivered to Burnaby South voters ahead of Monday’s byelection.

article continues below

A flyer distributed to residents in the federal riding assures them marking a ballot for the Tory candidate, Jay Shin, is in the best interest of the New Democrats.

“Save the NDP! Defeat Jagmeet Singh so the NDP can get a new leader,” the orange flyer reads with a picture of Singh, the party’s leader since 2017. “Polling shows the best way to defeat Jagmeet Singh is to lend your vote to the Conservatives. Vote for Jay Shin on Monday.”

The message may seem like a desperate gambit from NDP supporters so concerned about the direction of their party that they're willing to ""lend"" support to the Conservative.

But a small-print disclosure on the flyer’s reverse shows that’s not the case: “Authorized by the agent for Jay Shin.”

""Save the NDP! Defeat Jagmeet Singh so the NDP can get a new leader.""



This last-minute plea for votes from the Conservatives takes concern trolling to a whole new level. #cdnpoli #BurnabySouth pic.twitter.com/ghYAqOI3of — Kelvin🐶Gawley (@KelvinGawley) February 24, 2019

The flyer also quotes six different media sources, including a quote from former NDP Leader Tom Mulcair saying “it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around” should he lose.

Singh’s spokesperson, James Smith, called the flyer “a ridiculous attack from the Conservatives who are trying to stop bleeding votes to Maxime Bernier’s party, I guess by any means necessary.”

“While Liberals and Conservatives say they aren’t worried about what Jagmeet Singh brings to the table, they’re sure spending a lot of time targeting him,” Smith wrote in an email.

Stewart Prest, a political scientist at Simon Fraser University, said the last-minute campaign tactic is “cheeky, to say the least.”

“It's very much right up in the NDP's face and trying to take advantage of the string of stories we've had about the difficulties Jagmeet Singh has faced in getting his leadership off the ground and fully operational for the election,” he said.

While attack ads and negative politics are nothing new, Prest said he’s never seen something quite like this.

“It's rare for a party to insert itself so directly into the internal affairs of another party,” he said.

The tactic is unlikely to swing a big swathe of the electorate, Prest said, but in a riding where the NDP won by less than 550 votes in 2015, “a small swing in one direction or another can make a big difference.”

“I don't know that it's going to have that much of an effect, but they're clearly pulling out all the stops and being innovative in their messaging as we come to the close of this byelection,” he said.

Shin said the idea for the flyer came after hearing concerns about Singh’s leadership from traditional NDP supporters.

Asked why he would choose to amplify that message, rather than contrast policy positions in a flyer, Shin said “Well I’m here to win this election. The fact is that means beating Jagmeet Singh.”

Shin said his campaign began blanketing Burnaby South with the “Save the NDP” flyers on Saturday, as the campaign entered its final days.

Joining Shin and Singh on the ballot Monday will be Liberal Richard Lee, Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson of the People’s Party and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood.

Rehn initially brought the massive carbon tax bill to light in the Slave Lake Lakeside Leader during an interview. On Wednesday, however, Rehn was attacked on social media by a senior NDP government official who implied Rehn was misleading about the bill.



In response, Vanderwell Contractors – owner of one of the largest sawmills in the riding and the business in question – supplied billing information showing that the company paid a whopping $488,207.10 to cover its carbon tax bills for diesel, gasoline and natural gas for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In addition to that bill, the company also paid over $200,000 in carbon tax bills for its log-haul costs on the year.



“I’m glad the NDP gave me this opportunity to highlight the massive carbon tax bills being imposed on some of my riding’s largest employers,” Rehn said. “Price-taking businesses like this sawmill have to absorb tax increases like the NDP carbon tax, preventing them from growing and creating jobs. This whopper of a bill is a prime example of why the NDP carbon tax needs to be scrapped as soon as possible.”



Rehn called on the NDP government to call the election if it has nothing better to do than attack UCP candidates with misleading claims.



“I ask how it is that a taxpayer-paid employee of my NDP rival tweeted no less than seven partisan attacks on me during the work day. These attacks were clearly not related to the Minister’s duties regarding Children’s Services nor the Status of Women. The Minister should clarify whether government staff have been instructed to work on her re-election campaign during business hours when partisan activity is prohibited.”

Background

Vanderwell Contractors [1971] Ltd. utilizes 550,000-600,000 cubic metres of sawlogs every year.

The $488,207.10 in carbon tax costs on fuel cited above are direct on-site carbon tax costs for fuel related to mobile equipment on-site and the consumption of natural gas to run dry kilns that dry the lumber.

The company also runs its own trucking fleet to transport residual products to other facilities in the area, such as chips to pulp mills and hog fuel to biomass power plants.

An additional $200,000+ in carbon tax costs come from the cost of transporting logs to the sawmill.

The costs associated with forest management, harvesting and the hauling of logs accounts for more than 60 per cent of the total cost for the facility.

50 per cent of the costs of getting the logs to the sawmill are associated with the transportation of those logs.

A carbon tax of 5 cents per litre on diesel, for instance, equals 30 cents per cubic metre of additional costs associated with the transportation of the logs to the mill and an additional 12 cents per cubic metre associated with the harvesting of the logs.

This brings the total cost impact of the carbon tax to approximately 52 cents per cubic metre of logs consumed by the mill.

The Nova Scotia Health Authority has offered a commitment to publicly reporting data on hospital emergency departments however the provincial New Democrats are planning to push ahead with proposed legislation requiring them to do so.

In speaking with reporters via conference call Tuesday, Tim Guest, vice-president of integrated health services and chief nursing officer, said much of the data discussed by NDP leader Gary Burrill in the proposed bill is already being tracked by the NSHA. When asked specifically if the authority would start to proactively disclose it rather than require those wanting access to it to file a request under Freedom of Information, Guest said that it would.

The NDP caucus signalled its intention to introduce legislation that will require the government to report on the state of emergency rooms on a monthly basis. The proposed legislation would require the NSHA and the IWK to report monthly on things like the number of people who leave the ER without being seen and how many people show up at the ER without a family doctor. Burrill said that information is vital in trying to improve the system and information about someone’s local emergency department should be readily available to them.

“Plainly, the NSHA is moving now to make this information public which, previously been hidden behind a Freedom of Information wall, in response to public pressure,” Burrill said in a phone interview Wednesday. “The purpose of the act is to see that this information is available to the public all the time, under all circumstances, not just when the NSHA experiences themselves under public scrutiny and under intense public pressure.”

Burrill said the legislation, if passed, would also require the NSHA to continue to publish the data publicly according to a set schedule, not at its own whim and would not be a process that it could eventually decide to abandon.

In a subsequent followup, a spokesperson for the NSHA indicated that the information will be reported on a regular basis, probably monthly. She added that discussions have started regarding the format, which information is most useful to share and also around developing a schedule for posting the information. No specific timeline was available, but it was indicated that it could move ahead quickly.

On Tuesday, the NDP released figures it obtained under FOIPOP indicating the total number of ER visits in Nova Scotia by patients without family doctors, from 2013-2018 drove across the province.

Singh may well be looking to turn the page on the past year and a half. Since he was elected in October 2017, his leadership has been marked by poor polling, lacklustre fundraising and a steady trickle of caucus members making their way toward the exit.

But with Monday’s victory, analysts say, Singh has a fresh chance to make a new impression on Canadians, albeit a little later in the game than he’d probably like. “The chatter is over,” B.C. MP Nathan Cullen told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Mr. Singh’s ability to lead this caucus into the next election is 100 per cent secured.”

Still, his problems aren’t all behind him: a few of his heavyweight MPs, including Cullen, have yet to say if they’ll run again in the next election, and he faces a major obstacle in Quebec, where the NDP lost Outremont, the riding held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007, to the Liberals in another byelection on Monday.

But the timing for a fresh start isn’t bad, said former NDP strategist Farouk Karim. Singh will take his place in the House of Commons while the Liberals are mired in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, and as they table their last budget before this year’s election.

“It’s not often in life that you would have a second chance to make that impression,” Karim said. “And he has that opportunity.”

In his victory speech, Singh worked hard to paint Liberals and Conservatives as interested only in helping their “well-connected corporate friends,” while leaving ordinary Canadians in the lurch. “People should be angry at that, angry at governments in Ottawa that continue to develop a system that puts more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands,” he said, pointing to three issues — affordable housing, pharmacare and climate change — that will likely be pillars of the NDP’s election campaign.

Robin MacLachlan, a former NDP strategist, said there’s an opening for Singh while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is “reeling” from the SNC-Lavalin controversy, which he said has damaged Trudeau’s image “as being on the side of ordinary Canadians.”

“He has an opportunity to position himself as the leader who kind of gets what you’re facing,” he said.

With a seat in the House of Commons, Singh will finally have the chance to face off against Trudeau directly, though with little time remaining before the next election. “I would lower expectations. He’s not going to be 100 per cent from the get-go,” said Karim. “But I think if people see an improvement throughout, that will go a long way.”

Cullen said Singh took a risk in deciding to run for a seat in the Burnaby byelection, and it paid off. “I think Canadians are going to look at us in a new way, and I think Mr. Singh’s confidence is going to be boosted,” he said. “I’m looking forward to how he does.”

Arguably the biggest hurdle Singh now faces is Quebec, where the NDP has recently been polling as low as a dismal eight per cent, and nearly all of the party’s seats seem to be under threat. In a separate byelection on Monday, Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan won the Montreal riding of Outremont, which had been a Liberal stronghold until it was taken by Mulcair in 2007 and became a symbol of the party’s gains in that province.

After Bendayan’s victory, Liberals were quick to declare the death of the Orange Wave that swept through Quebec in 2011 and helped propel the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time. “It’s finished,” Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Just look at the results.”

But Singh played down the loss on Monday, saying the party “always knew that Outremont was going to be a tough riding.”

Karim said he was actually “pleasantly surprised” by the Outremont results, which saw NDP candidate Julia Sánchez finish second with 26 per cent of the vote — disappointing, but not catastrophic, according to Karim.

“I think it’s a little hope that the party can build on,” he said. “Twenty-six per cent is far from over, that’s what I would say to the Liberals.”

Singh, clearly recognizing the importance of building his profile in Quebec, said on Monday that he plans to travel to the province next week. Currently, more than a third of the NDP caucus is from Quebec, but several Quebec MPs have said they won’t run again, including Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, who both made their announcements last week.

MacLachlan said the NDP could attract Quebec voters concerned about climate change, and upset about the Trudeau government’s decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline. Karim said the strong third-place showing of the Green Party in Outremont, which finished with 12.5 per cent of the vote, proves that Quebecers “want answers” on the environment.

Outside Quebec, two other high-profile NDP MPs — B.C.’s Cullen and Murray Rankin — have yet to announce whether they’ll run again in this year’s election. So far, 11 of the 44 NDP MPs elected in 2015 have either resigned their seats or have said they won’t seek re-election.

But MacLachlan said Singh’s win should help “consolidate support” for the leader within and outside his caucus. Now, he said, Singh needs to focus on building his profile from inside the House of Commons.

“He needs to reintroduce himself to Canadians,” MacLachlan said. “He’s been absent from the national conversation about policy, and now they’re going to hear from him.”

“Agriculture Minister Lana Popham chose a quiet Saturday morning to bring Bill 52 into force, and now the BC Farm Owners Association reports a number of farm families’ farmland housing plans have effectively been scuttled without warning,” said Marvin Hunt, MLA for Surrey-Cloverdale. “Surrey NDP MLAs publically promised the farmers they would be grandfathered, but that’s not what’s actually happening.”

“Farmers now have to prove they are farmers, just like B.C. homeowners have to prove they are not speculators,” said Ian Paton, BC Liberal Co-Critic for Agriculture and MLA for Delta South. “The Minister was clear she wanted to end speculation on the ALR by restricting home size. Just like the speculation tax, farmers now face added paperwork and fees to prove they are farmers.”

“Inter-generational farming takes place throughout the province, and the last thing these farmers need is more paperwork going into spring planting,” said Linda Larson, BC Liberal Co-Critic for Agriculture and MLA for Boundary-Similkameen. “This situation could have been avoided if the government had accepted our Opposition amendment to extend the time frame for farmers to adjust their residential design permit applications to reflect the government’s proposed changes to house sizes— but the Minister would not listen.”

Popham introduced Bill 52 in early November, with only an interim report on the proposed home size changes having been completed.

OTTAWA – While New Democrats are pleased to learn that the federal government has finally responded to the United Nations’ call for additional funding for humanitarian assistance in Yemen, they urge the Liberals to follow this funding with an immediate end to the arms trade with Saudi Arabia.

“As Canada joins the international community to provide desperately needed assistance in Yemen, it continues to export arms to Saudi Arabia, the chief instigator of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” says Linda Duncan, the NDP International Development Critic.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 80 percent of Yemenis – 24 million people – require some form of humanitarian assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need.

“It has been four months since the Prime Minister announced that his government was reviewing the existing arms export licenses to Saudi Arabia. When can we expect a decision?” added Hélène Laverdière, the NDP Foreign Affairs Critic.

Despite numerous calls from the NDP, the Liberal government has refused to take the appropriate steps to ensure that Canadian-made arms are not being used to create the suffering that our aid is meant to relieve.

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the ""most rewarding experience"" of his life.

""I've got to know so many people in our community,"" he said. ""I've got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I've really enjoyed that.""

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP's prospects or Jagmeet Singh's leadership.

The Canadian Press NDP MP Murray Rankin stands during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Friday.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats' fortunes are ""definitely going up,"" adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by ""significant margins"" over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

""It looks to me to be a turning point,"" he said. ""We will have a leader in the House ... I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.""

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October's election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec's Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.'s Fin Donnelly.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he's done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

""I hope I've made a difference,"" Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the ""constitutional crisis"" involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

Prior to becoming a politician, Rankin worked as a law professor and practising lawyer with expertise in public and environmental law.

But she took over government just as the province headed into a difficult oil-driven recession.She might have the intelligence of Lougheed and the likeability of Klein but she seems to have the luck of Getty and Stelmach.'

There is good news and bad news in the Alberta government’s third-quarter fiscal update released Wednesday.

The good news: the provincial deficit, originally pegged at almost $9 billion, will be closer to $7 billion.

The bad news: pretty much everything else.

This is not a good news update, to say the least. Even the good news is really not good.

The best the government could come up with for its fiscal update news release was, “Alberta’s deficit will drop below budget forecasts for the second year in a row as the province stays on track to balance in 2023-24.”

Put another way: the government is still running multi-billion annual deficits; the accumulated debt is $60 billion and on track to hit almost $100 billion by the time the budget is balanced in 2023-24; oil prices are soft; the province’s economic recovery is faltering; and there’s still no new energy pipeline in sight.

This is Alberta’s fiscal situation on the eve of a provincial election.

If there’s no overtly good news in the documents, there is some less-than-bad-news — but you have to dig to find it. And then you have to spin it.

Alberta, for example, has the lowest debt to GDP ratio in Canada. But that’s the kind of pointy headed comparison that brings a warm tingle to economists, not voters.

Alberta also has the lowest tax regime of any province in Canada. If we hiked our taxes to match British Columbia’s, we could collect another $11 billion a year in revenue (and wipe out that deficit).

On paper, Alberta’s overall fiscal picture is relatively rosy compared to other provinces.

But Alberta’s NDP is not running for re-election in debt-riddled Ontario or taxed-to-the-hilt Quebec.

It is running in a province where voters have been told over the years they can have low taxes, generous government spending, and balanced budgets.

It is running in a province where the official Opposition United Conservative Party is promising to scrap the carbon tax, find “efficiencies” in government spending without resorting to cuts, all the while balancing the budget.

There is so much fiction mixed in with the Opposition promises you have to wonder if novelist John Grisham is on the UCP staff. But this is the kind of whistling-past-the-graveyard campaign strategy that has worked so well in past Alberta elections.

There is something else at work here, too, that has determined the course of Alberta politics: Luck.

I’m not being flippant or facetious.

Alberta political fortunes have risen and fallen on what amounts to luck: namely, the price of oil and gas.

Alberta’s first Progressive Conservative premier, Peter Lougheed, rode an oil boom to fame and provincial fortune in the 1970s. Next came Don Getty who became so unpopular during an oil recession he lost his own seat in Edmonton in 1989. Ralph Klein was born under a lucky star. Not only did he personally win $100,000 in a lottery shortly after becoming premier, Klein had so much natural-gas money flowing into the provincial treasury he paid off the provincial debt and gave away more than a billion worth of “Ralph-bucks” to Albertans on a whim. His successor Ed Stelmach became premier just in time for the 2008 world financial crisis — and quit less than two years later.

Rachel Notley, Alberta’s first NDP premier, is smart and personable. But she took over government just as the province headed into a difficult oil-driven recession.

She might have the intelligence of Lougheed and the likeability of Klein but she seems to have the luck of Getty and Stelmach.

She arguably did everything right on the Trans Mountain pipeline file by introducing a climate leadership plan that convinced Prime Minister Trudeau to approve the project in 2016. But Trudeau has proven to be a troubled and at times fickle ally who has managed to alienate Albertans even after he spent $4.5 billion to buy Trans Mountain.

Just a few months ago Alberta was on track to have one of the fastest growing economies in Canada. Now, it’s near the bottom of the pack.

That’s in part due to Notley’s policy of restricting the amount of oil produced in Alberta. She wanted to increase the price Alberta receives for its landlocked oil. Ironically, the policy worked too well. The price rose so high that some companies said they couldn’t afford to ship oil by rail. Production has dropped to the point that the Conference Board of Canada released a report Wednesday predicting Alberta’s economic growth will slow to 1.3 per cent.

Notley has been trying to make her own luck through green energy initiatives to create jobs, progressive policies to protect workers, and an aggressive pro-pipeline stance to help the oil industry.

As the province’s third-quarter fiscal update would suggest, this is a not a government born under a lucky star.

OTTAWA – On Thursday, NDP Health Critic Don Davies (Vancouver – Kingsway) introduced a bill to address violence against health care workers in Canada. The legislation would amend the Criminal Code to require a court to consider the fact that the victim of an assault is a health care sector worker to be an aggravating circumstance for the purposes of sentencing.

“Violence against health care workers has become a pervasive and growing problem within the Canadian health care system,” said Davies. “They deal every day with trauma and the public, and the number and intensity of attacks are growing at an alarming rate. This bill sends a strong message that those who provide such critical services must be treated with respect and security.”

Supporting Davies’ plan was Mark Hancock, National President of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE); Tanya Williams, a CUPE member from the University Health Network in Toronto; Linda Silas, President of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions; and Marc Page, Bargaining Unit President for the Ottawa Hospital.

“Governments and employers across Canada have starved health care workplaces of the funding and resources they need to keep workers safe. Too many are forced to work alone or understaffed, and patients are left underserved, all of which has made violent incidents more prevalent. Finally, this issue is getting the attention it desperately needs,” said Hancock.

The number of violence-related lost-time claims for frontline health care workers has increased by almost 66 percent over the past decade, three times the rate of increase for police and correctional service officers combined. According to the Association of Workers' Compensation Boards of Canada, there were 16,617 lost time claims for health sector occupations across Canada in 2017 alone.

“It’s a pressure cooker out there on the front lines of health care,” said Silas. “In addition to deterrence, this bill is about taking it out of the hands of nurses and putting it in the hands of law enforcement so that nurses can focus on our area of expertise: patient care.”

National data shows that 61 percent of nurses experienced a “serious” problem with some form of violence over a recent 12 month period. Over the same year, two thirds of nurses (66 percent) considered leaving their job to work for a different employer or in a different occupation.

“Health care workers take care of us at our most vulnerable. In turn, we have a responsibility to take care of them,” added Davies. “Governments, employers, unions and other health care stakeholders all have a role to play in tackling this crisis.”",NDP Wants to Stop Violence Against Health Care Workers,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-wants-stop-violence-against-health-care-workers

When B.C. moves to a “mandatory registration” system for immunization of children against measles and other diseases, anti-vaxxers will be in for a rude awakening. It will mean parents will be required to prove their kids have been immunized before they can register for school.

And if an anti-vaxxing parent is absolutely determined to not immunize their child, they’ll have to jump through a lot of hoops to do it.

That’s the word from Health Minister Adrian Dix, who said B.C. wants to bring in a system like the one in Ontario, which has Canada’s toughest vaccination laws.

“In Ontario, it’s essentially mandatory to be immunized. If not, you have to go through some significant processes to avoid that,” Dix said, adding B.C. is looking closely at what Ontario has done.

“It would function in a similar way,” Dix told me. “At the moment of school registration, you have to either show that the child has been immunized or, if that’s not the case, you have to go through a process to explain why.”

In Ontario, an anti-vaxxing parent must complete a “Statement of Conscience or Religious Belief” form and have it witnessed by an “Affidavits Commissioner.” The parent must also go through a 30-minute “Immunization Education Session” with a public health officer, who explains the medical risks of not vaccinating. The parent has to supply proof they attended the session.

If an anti-vaxxing parent goes through all those steps, then the child would be allowed to attend school.

Why not just make it illegal for unvaccinated kids to enrol in public schools? After all, a new opinion poll says 70 per cent of Canadians want vaccines to be mandatory. Dix said it’s because of a little thing called the Constitution and the inevitability of a Charter challenge in court if the government went down that road.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

“Then it doesn’t become an issue of public health. It becomes an issue of litigation. No one wants that,” he said, adding it’s an extremely serious step to keep a kid out of school. “We don’t want to make them pawns in these discussions.”

How quickly could B.C. bring in an Ontario-style system? Dix told me he thinks it can be fast-tracked though cabinet-ordered regulations, not requiring any new legislation to be passed in the legislature. He also pointed out B.C. has been studying the idea for some time after the province’s former medical health officer, Perry Kendall, recommended a mandatory vaccination registry five years ago.

All of which makes you ask: Why wasn’t this done a long time ago? Especially after earlier serious outbreaks of measles in 2010 and 2014? That’s when the Liberals were in power, of course.

But that didn’t stop Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson from insisting the NDP government should be doing more now to get kids vaccinated and prevent the spread of measles. Wilkinson called on the government to make post-exposure vaccines free and more widely available for unvaccinated people exposed to the virus.

Kind of makes you wonder why the Liberals didn’t do more when they had the chance. For now, it’s time for the government to toughen up B.C.’s vaccination rules.

Back when Christy Clark was premier, her then-governing Liberals took a political shellacking for shutting down underutilized public schools.

The schools were typically closed because they were old and in poor repair, in addition to being only partly full because of declining enrolment.

The Liberals decided it didn’t make sense to spend millions of dollars to repair near-empty schools. That was especially true when it came to expensive seismic upgrades to make sure crumbling, old schools didn’t collapse in earthquakes.

One of the fiercest opponents of the Liberals’ school closures was Rob Fleming, then the NDP education critic on the opposition benches.

“What is this about?” Fleming asked. “Is it about real-estate values and the sale of assets? Is it about power and control and usurping authority from local school districts?

“They’re abandoning communities, abandoning neighbourhoods by taking schools right out of the heart of those communities.”

That was 2016. Now it’s three years later and Fleming is the education minister, and the threat of school closures has returned in Vancouver. The Vancouver school board just issued a new capital plan that identifies 28 underutilized schools at risk of collapse in an earthquake. None of the schools is formally scheduled to close. At least not yet.

But some of the schools could be targeted for closure as the district seeks provincial cash for badly needed repairs and seismic upgrades. So what does Fleming say about possible school closures now?

“There’s no pressure coming from the provincial government to close schools,” Fleming said Monday, adding the government has already approved $240 million in seismic upgrades without any school closures.

But Fleming admitted the government did require the board to conduct an “inventory” of its current facilities.

“That’s not pressure,” he said. “That’s just accounting for the condition of the facilities and what the utilization rates are.”

The board’s capital plan makes clear that the province expects school districts to manage its buildings “in an effective, economic and efficient way.”

Just like the Liberals before them, that leaves the New Democrats facing the possibility of spending millions of dollars to seismically upgrade schools that have empty classrooms due to declining enrolment.

I asked Fleming if he can guarantee Vancouver parents that their kids’ school will not be shut down.

“There is absolutely no pressure coming from the provincial government,” he repeated, dodging the question. “I will let the Vancouver school board speak to their process. I applaud Vancouver for committing to engaging with parents.”

Translation: He can’t guarantee that schools won’t close.

Fleming was pitiless in his attacks on the Liberals for shutting schools.

But it’s easy to attack from the opposition benches, and much more difficult to make the tough choices in government.

Budget, about how the current housing market slowdown is a sign that the province’s tough housing taxation measures are “seeing results.”

James said on Budget day, “I’m feeling cautiously optimistic about the direction we’re taking so far… And I want us to see that continue.” She added that “there’s more work to be done,” and that “while B.C. is “starting to see moderation in the market, I don’t think we are at a stage where we can say that housing is affordable.”

All this sounds very much like James is rooting for a deeper price correction, doesn’t it? Never mind Property Transfer Tax revenues plummeting this year – the B.C. government clearly believes it’s more important that home prices drop, so that more people can afford to get into homeownership. Right?

Well, maybe. But there’s evidence to the contrary.

First, James also said on Budget day, “I don’t believe we’re going to see a crash in the housing market.”

OK. So she wants home prices to fall further… but only a little bit? How is that going to move the dial on affordability? (Answer: it isn’t.)

Further, although provincial documentation shows that the province is expecting a $400 million shortfall in its forecast Property Transfer Tax revenues for 2018/19, the total revenues from B.C. residential taxes are in fact forecast to increase over the following three years. They are expected to rise from $951 million in 2019/20 to $1.146 billion in 2019/20, $1.183 billion in 2020/21, and $1.219 billion in 2021/22.

Evidently, the B.C. government (like the B.C. Real Estate Association) is betting on a market recovery – if not this year, then from 2020 through 2022. Indeed, with no new taxation measures announced in the 2019 Budget, the NDP’s lavish spending promises are probably, at least partly, banking on it.

It seems to me that James is giving British Columbians the “we’re for housing affordability” message that they want to hear, while at the same time hoping for a robust real estate market to help swell the provincial coffers.

The predicted decline in housing starts, and corresponding concerns over supply, could well play into this scenario. The 2019 Budget forecast a drop in housing starts of up to 30 per cent across B.C. over the next three years. If this comes to pass, and housing demand starts to outweigh supply once more, we could see a return of the FOMO factor that drove up home sales and prices between 2015 and 2017.

Cameron Muir, chief economist at the BC Real Estate Association, said last week of the predicted construction decline, “That is exactly the wrong thing you need in order to keep housing affordable.”

So if you think the NDP government is on the side of drastically bringing down home prices, I advise you to think twice.

B.C. Premier John Horgan and Environment Minister George Heyman defended their opposition to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion Wednesday, as opposition critics pointed to evidence that Alaska oil tankers, B.C. Ferries and other shipping are a bigger risk to resident killer whales than one extra tanker a day from B.C.

B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson referred to a recent study in the journal Nature that describes risks affecting southern resident killer whales. That study concluded that “acoustic and physical disturbances” from shipping are a threat, as the Salish Sea sees increasing shipping of all kinds.

“The expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline would result in 29 extra sailings per month, about one per day,” Wilkinson told the legislature. “The environment minister recently defended the addition of 2,700 sailings per year by B.C. Ferries, on top of the existing 117,000 sailings by B.C. Ferries.”

Heyman referred repeatedly to a “seven-fold increase” in tanker traffic that the Trans Mountain expansion would generate, as oil shipments from Trans Mountain’s Burnaby terminal are expected to increase from one a week to one per day. The pipeline twinning was recommended to proceed by the National Energy Board for a second time Feb. 22, with a proposal to reduce impact from all shipping in the region to mitigate the additional tankers.

B.C. Liberal environment critic Peter Milobar said energy shipments represent only one per cent of the noise pollution affecting resident killer whales, and in the Salish Sea the majority of tanker traffic is from Alaska to Washington state refineries.

Heyman responded that U.S. tankers are outside B.C.’s jurisdiction. The NDP government is continuing a court case in an effort to define provincial jurisdiction in oil transportation, which is federally regulated because it begins in Alberta and terminates in B.C. and Washington, where it has supplied refineries and tankers since 1954.

The southern resident killer whale population has been intensively studied by Canadian and U.S. researchers. Its population has fluctuated between 70 and 99 orcas since 1976, and as of 2017 it numbered 76 members.

Even though Metro Vancouver’s housing market has slowed dramatically over the past year, an SFU professor of finance says that doesn’t necessarily mean that homes are becoming more affordable.

“If incomes are going down, who cares if prices are lower?” Andrey Pavlov of the Beedie School of Business told the Straight by phone. “You still can’t afford to get into the market.”

It’s why he’s skeptical about the approach of the City of Vancouver and the B.C. government.

According to him, they’ve “done everything in their power to suppress demand”.

In the case of the city, it’s through measures like the empty-homes tax and zoning restrictions that drive up prices. To cite an example, he pointed to the massive number of low-rise warehouses in the area around Terminal Avenue and Main Street, as well as in other areas of Vancouver.

“That, in my view, is a very inefficient use of space,” Pavlov said. “If you need the warehouses, you put them underground. Or you build on top of it—more residential or office. People do that all the time. It’s not rocket science.”

Because this land is being set aside exclusively for industrial purposes, it leaves fewer sites for housing. And more housing, in his view, could lead to lower prices.

He also accused the province of suppressing demand with a range of new real-estate taxes. They include a surtax on expensive properties (called a school tax), a vacancy tax (also known as a speculation tax), and an increase in the property-transfer tax.

“Sure, they may reduce prices,” Pavlov acknowledged. “But you have a higher tax bill. So your monthly payment doesn’t change all that much.

""And even if it does, that’s a terrible way to provide affordability, and it will not work because you’re slowing down the economy.”

In 2013, then City of North Vancouver mayor Darrell Mussatto showed the Straight how his laneway house allowed for gentle densification. Charlie Smith

Pavlov thinks more supply is necessary

So what’s Pavlov’s prescription? Over the long term, he argues that adding housing supply is really the only solution.

That’s because adding supply doesn’t necessarily make housing more unaffordable because that’s tied to the price-to-income ratio.

“You need a situation where incomes are rising and prices are stable,” he said. “That’s going to help people get into the market.”

He contrasted that with “taxing everyone to death”.

Furthermore, he said that over the long term, curbing the housing supply reduces population growth, even though that's not widely acnkowledged.

“How many more people are we going to squeeze into the existing square footage?” he asked.

Pavlov revealed that he's recently conducted research with UBC scholars Tsur Somerville and Tom Davidoff about the impact of laneway housing on home prices.

They found that the existence of a laneway house did not have a huge impact on the value of most neighbouring homes.

However, it made a difference with the most expensive adjacent houses, which tend to be in areas like Shaughnessy, Point Grey, and Dunbar.

""It's not so much really about the neighbourhood,"" Pavlov emphasized. ""It's about the price of your home and your neighbour's home. If those are high, you are affected by your neighbour having a laneway [home].""

He suggested that this research could give confidence to municipal governments to allow gentle densification through more laneway housing without worrying that it will have an effect on home values in most cases.

""That seems not to bother the neighbours and it's obviously beneficial to the owners who actually do it,"" he said.

CMHC stress-testing rules came at a bad time

Pavlov thinks it was necessary for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to subject mortgage borrowers to new stress-testing rules in late 2017.

But he’s concerned about the timing because this came after a big run-up in housing prices.

“This is the worst time to introduce restrictions on how much people can borrow,” Pavlov said. “Mortgage lending should be tightened when real-estate markets are rising, not when they’re flat or falling.”

He worries about the effects of all of these policies on the domestic economy, particularly if there’s a slowdown internationally.

“All these measures take a year or two to take effect,” he stated. “You raise this tax, you raise that tax, and people aren’t going to stop what they’re doing on the same day. But they’re sure going to scale back their investments going forward. It takes a year for those things to take effect.

“Unless we reverse course right now,” Pavlov added, “I do predict we’re going to have a substantial economic slowdown relative to the rest of the world because of those tax policies and the resulting slowdown in the real-estate market.”","SFU prof Andrey Pavlov says NDP housing taxes miss the mark, declaring that new supply is only long-term solution",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1206636/sfu-prof-andrey-pavlov-says-ndp-housing-taxes-miss-mark-declaring-new-supply-only-long

Monday in question period, Armstrong urged the Ford Conservatives to pass without delay her private member’s bill, the Time to Care Act, which would do just that. Doug Ford’s Health Minister refused to commit.

“No one should have to worry that the needs of their parent or grandparent will be overlooked because long-term care staff is overstretched,” said Armstrong. “Demand for long-term care is only going to grow as Baby Boomers enter their golden years, and we need to make sure adequate support is available for them in long-term care.

“We know front-line workers are already run off their feet. Parents and grandparents need more than just a bed — they need support from caring staff to protect their health, dignity and safety.”

It has been more than a decade since a report by Shirley Sharkey identified the need for an average of at least four hours of hands-on care per day. And it has now been more than six months since Armstrong’s bill passed first reading — yet there has been virtually no progress in getting long-term care residents the hands-on support they need every day.

By The Associated Press on February 27, 2019.

PARIS – Award-winning Mexican director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu will preside over the jury at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival in May.

Festival president Pierre Lescure, announcing the choice on Wednesday, praised Inarritu – the first Mexican to be given the honour – as a “daring filmmaker … full of surprises” and an “artist of his time.”

Inarritu said in the statement that “this is a true delight and a responsibility that we will assume with passion and devotion.”

The Cannes festival, he said, is the heart of world cinema.

Inarritu won best director Oscar for “The Revenant” in 2016 and “Birdman” in 2015, among numerous awards.

Cate Blanchett served as jury president last year when the Palme d’Or, the top prize, was awarded to “Shoplifters” by Japanese director Kore-eda Hirokazu.

Canada and Mexico are dealing with lingering hard feelings over last summer’s surprise Mexican trade deal with the United States as their new continental trade pact awaits a final stamp of political approval.

Two weeks ago, the head of a visiting delegation of Canadian parliamentarians told the newly installed Mexican foreign minister his country threw Canada “under the bus” last August when it forged a bilateral trade deal with the United States during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A top Mexican trade official tells The Canadian Press that while there may have been a misunderstanding, the U.S. side deal was the work of the previous Mexican government, and Canada and Mexico’s new leaders are moving forward constructively.

The side deal between the U.S. and Mexico appeared to blindside the Trudeau government, forcing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to abort a three-country trip to Europe.

Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country’s three leaders – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.

The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.

Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.

Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.

The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada’s dissatisfaction about last August’s Mexican side deal with the country’s new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization’s Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

“We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,” Nault said in an interview.

Nault said he was concerned about “the way it unfolded at the end,” and a perception “that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico.” He said that represented a break from “what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn’t overtake us.”

The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.

“I think it’s getting better,” Nault said this week of the relationship. “Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.”

Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico’s deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.

“That was part of the negotiation process … right now, it’s over,” de la Mora said in an interview.

“The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.”

The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.

De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico’s top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.

Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn’t begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country’s lawmakers.

During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador’s team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.

“We were not involved in that decision at all,” de la Mora said.

“If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.”

She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.

OTTAWA — Fewer Canadians are living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday

The agency laid the credit for the drop on a combination of a buoyant economy and the Liberals signature child benefit.

The national statistics office says that in 2017, the most recent year available, 3.4 million Canadians, or 9.5 per cent of the population, lived below the poverty line the government officially adopted late last year — including 622,000 children — which is the lowest the agency reported going back to 2006.

The drops since the Liberals took office in 2015 were also noted in the agency's release: 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada said an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017 — which Liberals touted Tuesday as a political and policy victory.

""It certainly shows a program that is simple for the government to manage, simple for families to receive, and fair for everyone ... is a good thing when it comes to making more Canadians able to make ends meet,"" Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in an interview.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives' universal child care benefit. The agency calculates that between 2016 and 2017, a couple with children saw their median benefit rise by $1,200, while lone parents received an extra $1,300.

Duclos suggested numbers will drop further, particularly once the Canada Workers Benefit launches next month and expands a wage subsidy introduced under former prime minister Stephen Harper to boost the incomes of the country’s working poor.

Duclos was less clear about whether the Liberals would boost the base value of the child benefit or ensure immigration status doesn't affect eligibility as some anti-poverty activists have requested.

The Liberals promised in the 2015 election that the child benefit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty compared to 2013 figures, but based on a different measure of poverty than was previously used.

Parsing out the numbers, the Liberals met their projections: a drop of 315,000 in children in poverty in 2017 compared to 2013.

Last year, the Liberals pegged the value of the benefit to inflation — two years before they planned to do so — and promised by 2020 to cut poverty rates by 20 per cent of 2015 figures.

What Statistics Canada reported Tuesday is that there were 826,000 fewer people living in poverty in 2017 compared to 2015 — or just shy of the 20 per cent target.

An expert panel the Liberals turned to for help crafting the poverty plan originally recommended a 25 per cent target for 2020. The Liberals chose 20 per cent, leading some experts to suggest the goal was likely a given based on the measures the government had introduced.

The next part of the plan proposes a drop to 50 per cent of 2015 levels by 2030, which will require thought about how to ""make more of a dent in those who are living in and with extreme poverty,"" Lindsay Tedds, scientific director of fiscal and economic policy at the University of Calgary's school of public policy, said on Twitter.

A bill to set the poverty plan into law has yet to pass the House of Commons, but it doesn't propose any additional spending than what is already promised.

""We picked the indicator, we picked where we want the indicator to be, but there's no plan if we miss that target and there should be,"" said David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""That's the point of a poverty reduction plan as opposed to having just a tracking plan, which is presently what it is.""

The push is coming from public-health advocates and from at least one Liberal MP, Toronto’s Nathaniel Erksine-Smith.

British Columbia’s provincial health officer has called for Ottawa to look at the issue of supply, saying B.C. and other parts of the country are grappling with a poisonous street-drug supply that is killing people because they can’t tell what’s in the drugs they use.

Richard Elliott, the executive director of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, said it is necessary to address the toxicity of the drug supply to ultimately reduce the number of deaths.

WATCH: Largest-ever fentanyl bust made at U.S. border

His organization was part of a Canadian coalition that called on the government last fall to address the issue of supply, pointing to toxicology results from across Canada that reveal opioids purchased in the illegal market are often contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. Those can be much more potent than the opioids users believe they are consuming, and the difference between an ordinary dose and a lethal one is tiny.

“When you are in an emergency and the stuff you can get illegally is largely contaminated and may kill you even if you are seeking to be safe, as most people are, then we need to figure out, ‘OK, how do we substitute something safer for you to use instead of what you’re currently purchasing on the street and that is killing too many people,’ ” Elliott said in an interview this week.

The opioid crisis is affecting every community in every province and territory, said NDP health critic Don Davies, adding that Canadians understand that people are losing their lives as a result of “poison street supply.”

“Nobody is advocating drug use,” he said. “But as a public-policy response, they recognize that at least if we can control the supply, we can keep people alive and that’s a better public-policy approach than letting them die in the streets or alone in their homes.”

Davies said he shares the concern of advocates who recently expressed concern that the federal Liberals won’t want to address the issue in an election year.

Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said she asked her department to explore options to address the toxic supply in the fall, adding she looks forward to seeing advice from Canada’s top public-health doctor Theresa Tam on how to move forward.

“When we’ve consulted with many stakeholders, professionals and also individuals that use drugs, they’ve indicated the issue of safe supply is something we should really be looking at,” Petitpas Taylor said. “That’s exactly what we are doing.”

In a December interview, Tam told The Canadian Press that said clamping down on the market-driven supply of illicit drugs is not easy.

“I think my plea is an escalated, compassionate response,” she said. “To implement a lot of these measures, you need society to be on side.”

Tam’s comments came after the Public Health Agency showed that 94 per cent of opioid-related deaths in 2019 were classified as “accidental poisonings.”

Nearly 72 per cent were unintentional deaths involving highly toxic fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.","Liberals must tackle ‘poison street supply’ of opioids, advocates say",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5005677/liberals-opioids-safer-overdose/

(This was at a meeting Wilson-Raybould had Sept. 17, 2018 with Wernick and Trudeau, at a point when Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel had already decided not to offer a DPA, and Wilson-Raybould had decided it was not appropriate for her to intervene.)

Even if one accepts that it was A-OK for Trudeau and his minions to badger Wilson-Raybould into changing her mind – and she didn’t, and told the pair of them they were out of line, as indeed they were — why on Earth was Wernick so acutely aware of SNC’s business timelines?

He did it again two days later, at a second meeting Trudeau insisted Wilson-Raybould have with Wernick, mentioning again the upcoming SNC meeting, telling her that its lawyer, Frank Iacobucci (a former Supreme Court judge), was “no shrinking violet” and that he, Wernick, understood SNC was “going back and forth with” Roussel.

Why all this effort on behalf of SNC?

Well, the benign explanation is that DPAs are meant to spare innocent parties – workers, shareholders, pensioners – from paying the price for the corporate malfeasance of a few. Like plea bargains for individuals, DPAs are pragmatic tools for prosecutors.

And SNC-Lavalin, under its current CEO Neil Bruce and previous CEO Robert Card, has made much of how they have changed the corporate culture at the company, brought in a big broom and fired anyone remotely associated with bad behaviour and developed a whole ethical regime.

Why on Earth was Michael Wernick so acutely aware of SNC’s business timelines?

This is all to the good, if so.

But consider the company’s very checkered past, not all of it so long ago.

In 2016, on the heels of the Charbonneau inquiry into the construction industry in Quebec, SNC-Lavalin entered into a “voluntary reimbursement program” with the Quebec government.

According to Justice Quebec, this was a two-year program “to ensure mainly the recovery of amounts improperly paid as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics in connection with public contracts.” After paying back the monies owed, “participants could obtain a discharge that protected them from civil proceedings for fraud or fraudulent tactics” in connection with getting a public contract.

In October 2015, SNC-Lavalin reached a settlement with the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) “regarding allegations of sanctionable practices” by a subsidiary of the company in connection with two AfDB-financed projects, one in Uganda, the other in Mozambique.

According to the AfDB press release, the agreement “resolves allegations uncontested by the company of illicit payments ordered by former SNC International Inc. employees to public officials in order to secure contracts.”

Under the terms of the agreement, AfDB imposed “a conditional non-debarment (debarring prevents a company getting public contracts) … for a period of two years and 10 months” and repayment of $1.5 million.

The projects dated to October 2008 and December 2010.

More recently, in September 2016, SNC-Lavalin entered into a “compliance agreement” with the Commissioner of Elections Canada for illegal contributions made to federal political entities between March 9, 2004 and May 1, 2011.

According to the agreement on the Commissioner’s website, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. reimbursed $117,803.49 for illegal contributions, almost all of which had gone to the Liberal Party of Canada, various Liberal riding associations and contestants in the Liberal Party’s 2006 leadership race. The rest, $8,200, was tossed the way of the Conservative Party. (The company was reimbursing employees for contributions it had wanted them to make.)

And, of course, there’s the World Bank debarment of SNC-Lavalin, and 100 affiliates, for a period of 10 years.

That happened in April 2013, and, according to the World Bank press release, it was related to the company’s “misconduct in relation to the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in Bangladesh,” as well as unspecified misconduct in relation to another World Bank-financed Rural Electrification and Transmission project in Cambodia.

None of that much mattered when it came to giving SNC-Lavalin a pass.

In December 2015, less than two months after the Liberals came to power, SNC signed an “administrative agreement” with the federal government, allowing it to bid and win work despite the criminal charges still pending.

These fraud and bribery charges date back to 2000-2011, for its alleged $48-million worth of bribery in Libya, which are now in different ways before two Canadian courts.

As of Thursday, according to the Public Services and Procurement website, SNC-Lavalin is the only supplier in the country with such an agreement.

Just how stupid do the Liberals think Canadians are?

Liberals’ wins, losses?

Re PM Promised Change with Fresh Cabinet Faces. He May Regret It Now (Feb. 27): Yes, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited and appointed to cabinet a number of diverse candidates, with solid professional credentials but no political experience.

Story continues below advertisement

Yes, in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s case, this experiment in doing politics differently has backfired spectacularly.

However, to suggest Ms. Wilson-Raybould is on the side of the angels, a noble victim of the system, in my view is simply wrong.

Her “unwillingness to go along to get along” on many issues the government has addressed, not just SNC-Lavalin, could more accurately be described as an inability to compromise, achieve consensus, or be a team player.

And yes, politics is about teams, not prima donnas. Every cabinet minister wins some and loses some, but what other minister in living memory has been so intent on personal vindication that they risk destroying their party?

It seems to me that all the seeming mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin file by the Liberals is actually an astute play to ensure a majority win in the next election.

The calculation is simple: The West goes to the Conservatives, especially given the pipeline fiasco, with perhaps some seats in urban B.C., the Maritimes probably stays (mostly) Liberal.

What remains is Quebec and Ontario. To ensure Quebec’s support, Justin Trudeau is playing the “We will defend Quebec card” (SNC = Quebec business). Hence the bloodletting with the Butts resignation and the A-G demotion. When Mr. Trudeau says he is acting in the interest of Canadians and Canadian jobs, Quebec is the intended audience, and Quebec is listening. The longer the SNC issue continues, the better the chances of a Liberal majority win.

Now that he is fully installed, his ongoing clumsiness, immaturity and all-over-the-map election promises will make the Liberals’ Justin Trudeau look like a giant. If Mr. Singh had lost, the NDP would have found a new leader.

Re Anti-Vaxxer Lies Have Put My Baby’s Life At Risk (Feb. 23): One of my most vivid childhood memories is when the measles went through our household in prevaccine days.

My normally unflappable RN mother regularly monitored our temperatures throughout our illness, but I will never forget the terror in her voice when, despite her best efforts, my younger sister’s fever reached 106 F or 41 C. Fortunately, she recovered, but that memory has stayed with me for six decades. I never had a moment’s hesitation having my children vaccinated, and have often thought there would be far fewer anti-vaxxers among us if they had had an experience such as mine.

ABC’s of absenteeism

Re Ontario School Boards Hire Non-Certified Teacher Replacements (Feb. 25): Stripping teachers’ ability to bank sick days was a big blow. I banked those days to protect myself in case I had a major illness down the road.

I was never away unless I was so sick, I couldn’t get out of bed or was in hospital.

Then the government put in a new system of short-term and long-term sick leave. There is no need to save sick days of the “use it or lose it” variety, so teachers do take these sick days.

Story continues below advertisement

The suggestion that these days are vacation is nonsense. The threshold for what makes a teacher take a sick day has probably lowered, but the teacher is still sick. Is this true for everyone? No, but it is for the vast majority – like everyone at my school.

Teachers are, by and large, dedicated, hardworking, and there for their students. It is never okay to question or call into question the professionalism of teachers. Articles about teachers should focus on the incredible work that we do all day, every day, for the youth of Ontario instead of making a big deal of something that is not any sort of major issue.

Am I biased? Absolutely. But I am biased because I know the situation and scenario.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

OTTAWA – Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government will soon bring in legislation to provide pardons for anyone convicted of pot possession before the drug’s legalization last year.

Goodale said on Twitter he is going to put the House of Commons on notice that a bill will soon be introduced to provide “no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis.”

The notice is a procedural requirement for the government to introduce new legislation.

The details of the bill won’t be revealed until the legislation is officially presented to the House of Commons, which could occur as early as the end of this week.

But the Liberals have already telegraphed what they plan do.

In October, Goodale said the legislation would waive the application fee and five-year waiting period for Canadians seeking pardons for possessing up to 30 grams of marijuana – an offence that was punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and six months in jail.

But he dismissed at the time the idea of expunging criminal records, even though the Liberals legalized recreational cannabis use, because expungement was reserved for cases of past injustice involving charter rights violations.

A pardon, or record suspension, means a person’s criminal record is separated from other records and is only disclosed in limited circumstances.

So while a pardon doesn’t erase a record completely, it can make it easier to get a job or travel.

In December, the Commons began debating a private member’s bill from NDP MP Murray Rankin that would expunge criminal records for what he said were 500,000 Canadians with convictions for simple possession.

He warned that without help from the Liberals, his bill likely wouldn’t pass all the legislative hurdles to become law before this fall’s election.

“I would urge the Liberals to work with my bill and make it better so we can get on with the task that should have been commenced when we brought in legalization in the first place,” Rankin said during debate.

The House of Commons will rise at the end of June, giving the Liberals until then to get their legislation through the House of Commons and the Senate.

Two weeks ago, the head of a visiting delegation of Canadian parliamentarians told the newly installed Mexican foreign minister his country threw Canada ""under the bus"" last August when it forged a bilateral trade deal with the United States during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A top Mexican trade official tells The Canadian Press that while there may have been a misunderstanding, the U.S. side deal was the work of the previous Mexican government, and Canada and Mexico's new leaders are moving forward constructively.

The side deal between the U.S. and Mexico appeared to blindside the Trudeau government, forcing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to abort a three-country trip to Europe.

Watch: Trump says ""no one thought"" USMCA would be approved. Story continues below.

Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country's three leaders — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.

The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.

Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.

Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.

'I think it's getting better'

The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada's dissatisfaction about last August's Mexican side deal with the country's new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization's Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

""We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,"" Nault said in an interview.

Nault said he was concerned about ""the way it unfolded at the end,"" and a perception ""that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico."" He said that represented a break from ""what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn't overtake us.""

The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process. Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico's deputy trade minister

The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.

""I think it's getting better,"" Nault said this week of the relationship. ""Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.""

Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico's deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.

""That was part of the negotiation process ... right now, it's over,"" de la Mora said in an interview.

""The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.""

The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.

De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico's top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.

Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn't begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country's lawmakers.

'Those moments are over': Mexico's deputy trade minister

During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador's team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.

""We were not involved in that decision at all,"" de la Mora said.

""If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.""

She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.

""It would be very positive that the three countries have this agreement approved this year, really. It would be something that would send a really good signal to the markets.""","Mexico Threw Canada 'Under The Bus' During Trade Talks, Liberal MP Says",HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/28/mexico-canada-trade-talks_a_23680652/

OTTAWA – The Trudeau government has tabled its promised child welfare legislation aimed at stopping the over-representation of Indigenous children in foster care.

The bill emphasizes the need for the child welfare system to promote more preventative care and support for families instead of apprehending Indigenous children from their mothers.

Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan calls the legislation “historic” and says the main goal is to provide more opportunities for First Nations, Inuit and Metis to exercise jurisdiction over child and family services in their communities.

Indigenous leaders are applauding the bill, which was one of the first five calls to action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

National Chief Perry Bellegarde of the Assembly of First Nations says the number of First Nations children in care – over 40,000 – is a human rights crisis and that more attention must be paid to the needs of First Nations children in Canada.

Bellegarde says the legislation is an important first step, but stresses the need to have it passed before Parliament dissolves for the October election.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh

CALGARY – Documents show a federal investigator flagged labour code contraventions after a Canadian Pacific Railway train conductor died in a workplace accident in a Calgary rail yard last November.

A Transport Canada rail safety inspector, delegated by Alberta’s labour minister, raised the issues in a letter Friday to the railway’s assistant vice-president of safety.

A written directive attached to the letter, obtained by The Canadian Press, raises concerns over the company failing to identify and assess hazards to employees resulting from increased switching in the rail yard.

Another directive says the railway failed to secure and maintain the accident scene, and removed, interfered with and disturbed wreckage and other things without authorization.

A spokeswoman for Employment and Social Development Canada declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation because it is ongoing.

Canadian Pacific did not immediately provide comment.

The documents say the railway has until March 8 to inform the inspector of measures taken to make sure the failure of maintaining the accident scene doesn’t happen again.

It has until March 22 to fix issues related to the safety of the rail yard. The company was also told it can request a review by the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal Canada.

Federal officials are investigating a separate Canadian Pacific accident that killed a conductor, engineer and trainee earlier this month near Field, B.C., just west of the Alberta-British Columbia boundary.

A Transportation Safety Board investigator has said the westbound train was parked on a grade for two hours, with its air brakes applied, when it started rolling on its own.

The train sped up to well above the limit and derailed at a curve ahead of a bridge over the Kicking Horse River, sending 99 cars and two locomotives hurtling off the tracks.

This allows us to look at changes in income, income inequality and poverty over the first two years of the federal Liberal government.

Income growth, overall, was very modest. When adjusted for inflation, the average after tax income of all families and individuals rose by just 2.8%, from $71,200 in 2015 to $73,200 in 2017.

The average income of the top 10% of families and individuals rose from $197,200 to $201,400 and their share of all after tax income remained almost the same, 27.7% in 2015 and 27.5% in 2017.

The rate of poverty for all Canadians fell from 14.2% to 12.7% using the Low Income Measure (LIM), which defines poverty as having less than one half of the median or mid point income of a similar family. Based on the proposed new official measure of poverty, formalized by the federal government last year, the basic needs or Market Basket Measure (MBM), poverty fell significantly more, from 13.3% to 9.0%.

The child poverty rate fell from 13.3% to 9.0% according to the Market Basket Measure, due to the introduction of a reformed system of child tax credits in 2016. Using the Low Income Measure, it fell from 15.2% to 12.1%.

However, the poverty rate for seniors rose from 14.3% in 2015 to 15.4% in 2017 using the Low Income Measure. While the senior poverty rate is lower using the MBM measure (just 3.9% in 2017), despite the incomes of many seniors are lagging behind those of working age Canadians.

Changes to market incomes, taxes and income transfer programs have had some impact upon poverty, but less impact on income inequality which seems to have changed very little over the first two years of Liberal government.

While both measures are useful, a basic needs measure like the MBM only tells us that low income people can survive. The LIM tells us how many people are distant from the social mainstream.

Taking questions from reporters Thursday after an event at the Canadian Space Agency in St. Hubert, Que.,","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he is considering whether Jody Wilson-Raybould can remain in the Liberal caucus, as the Conservatives make a formal request for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation following her testimony in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Taking questions from reporters Thursday after an event at the Canadian Space Agency in St. Hubert, Que., Trudeau again took issue with Wilson-Raybould's version of events, and said he was taking time to consider her status.

""I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,"" he said.

MPs will hold an emergency debate tonight on Wilson-Raybould's damning testimony before the Commons justice committee, where the former justice minister alleged improper political interference and ""veiled threats"" by the Prime Minister's Office and government officials.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has asked for Trudeau's resignation and for a police investigation. Today, he wrote to the RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki formally requesting an investigation into possible Criminal Code offences related to provoking fear in an attorney general and obstructing or defeating the course of justice.

""She confirmed veiled threats of consequences if she did not bend to the political wishes of the Liberal Party and the financial interests of the shareholders of SNC-Lavalin. It was also clear that these actions rose to the highest ranks of the government,"" Scheer wrote.

RCMP reviewing request

The RCMP acknowledged receiving the letter and said the commissioner is reviewing it.

Meanwhile, late Thursday, two former federal attorneys general — Peter MacKay, who served in the role under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Douglas Grinslade Lewis, who served under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — penned a letter to the RCMP asking for a police investigation into the matter. The letter was also signed by three former provincial attorneys general: Jonathan Denis, Progressive Conservative, from Alberta; Cecil Clarke, Progressive Conservative, from Nova Scotia; and Colin Gabelmann, NDP, from British Columbia. ""We write today to urge you to ensure that you use all resources at your disposal to fully and fairly investigate any potential criminality and provide Canadians with the truth in this crucial matter, as it strikes at the core of the rule of law and independence of our justice system,"" the letter said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has called for a public inquiry.

During a raucous question period today, Scheer expressed outrage that Trudeau was not in the House of Commons to answer questions as the controversy rages, calling it ""disgusting.""

During her committee appearance, Wilson-Raybould offered few details on why she resigned from Trudeau's cabinet.

""I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table, that's why I resigned,"" she said.

Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press More

She declined to explain why she quit cabinet or disclose details of her conversations with the prime minister prior to her resignation. But she described experiencing ""heightened anxiety"" as she waited for the ""other shoe to drop.""

She said that one week before a Jan. 14 cabinet shuffle, she received a call from Trudeau advising her she was being moved from the justice portfolio.

“I and my team always acted in an appropriate and professional manner,” Trudeau said Thursday morning at a press conference that was supposed to be about interstellar exploration at the Canadian Space Agency in St-Hubert but was overshadowed by the SNC-Lavalin scandal. “So I am not in agreement with the characterization of events that the former attorney general gave in her testimony. We have always defended and looked to protect jobs in Canada and we will always do so.”

Trudeau said the RCMP has not contacted him or other government officials about the affair, to his knowledge. On Thursday, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said he urged the head of the RCMP to launch an investigation, contending that the Liberals broke laws under the Criminal Code related to obstructing justice and interfering with the attorney-general. He also repeated calls for Trudeau to step down.

Asked who was telling the truth, Trudeau said the government’s ethics commissioner is investigating and will come to a conclusion. Federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion started his investigation two weeks ago.

“Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge, who is an officer of Parliament, who will make a determination in this issue,” Trudeau said.

“So, while political parties and various people are trying to draw a lot of attention to this issue, there is a process, both through the justice committee and indeed the ethics commissioner, that will make a determination on what actually happened here.”

In testimony before the House of Commons Justice Committee, former justice minister Wilson-Raybould said senior levels of the federal government and the prime minister himself pressured her repeatedly for months and interfered politically in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Senior staff wanted her to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges over over allegations SNC paid millions in bribes to win government contracts in Libya, and move instead to negotiate a remediation agreement, she said. A guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin would mean the engineering-construction giant would be barred from bidding on federal procurement contracts for 10 years. SNC said the managers involved in the Libya deals are no longer with the company and it has tightened its ethics management.

Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau noted he was a Quebec MP, inferring there could be repercussions for him and the Liberal Party in general in Quebec.

Trudeau stressed on Thursday his main concern was to protect jobs, not his political future or that of his party.

“There were many and broad conversations about the importance of saving jobs, not just in Quebec but across the country,” Trudeau said.

“These are good jobs, and pensioners and people who rely on the kind of work that is being done in Canada and around the world. And my job as prime minister is always to stand up for good jobs, to invest in good jobs.”

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould was moved from her post as justice minister to veterans affairs in January, two weeks after she last rejected pressure from Trudeau’s staff to defer prosecution, because senior cabinet minister Scott Brison announced he was leaving politics, “which created a number of opportunities and consequences that we moved forward on.”

Asked if SNC-Lavalin threatened to move their head office from Montreal if they were subjected to criminal prosecution, Trudeau replied: “We know that there are many factors that go into decisions like that — we also know that it is pretty fundamental, that all Canadians expect of their governments to look for ways to protect jobs and ensure that we continue to grow the economy.”

Top ministers echoed the prime minister in separate appearances Thursday.

In Toronto, Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied that his chief of staff, Ben Chin, did anything inappropriate in discussing the SNC-Lavalin case with Wilson-Raybould’s staff.

“My staff, of course, is going to be constantly in communication with other teams across the government, always talking about the importance of the economy, always talking about the importance of jobs and that is their appropriate role,” Morneau said. “I think that Ben was acting entirely appropriately in that capacity.”

Morneau did not directly address Wilson-Raybould’s assertion that Chin pressured her staff to take into consideration the political impact on last fall’s Quebec election if SNC-Lavalin were to move its operations out of the country. He did say that he did not direct Chin to do that.

Morneau emphasized that the company employs 9,000 people across the country and thousands of pensioners are dependent on its continued operation. It was appropriate to take that into consideration, while respecting the rule of law, he said.

In a speech to the Empire Club of Canada, Wilson-Raybould’s successor as justice minister and attorney general, David Lametti, said her testimony was an extraordinary symbol of transparency in the government. He also said it’s useful for the attorney general to sit at the cabinet table — unlike in some other jurisdictions, where the attorney general and justice minister are distinct.

“Just like the world outside politics, each of us is made stronger by talking to each other and coming to better understandings together,” he said. “I believe that these discussions can improve the quality of decision making. The attorney-general is not an island, even in circumstances where a final decision rests with him or her.”

While Trudeau and his ministers seemed intent on projecting a business-as-usual confidence, the Conservatives requested an emergency debate in the House of Commons Thursday on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. The NDP supported the request, which was granted by Speaker Geoff Regan.

Trudeau came to the Canadian Space Agency to announce Canada would be joining the U.S.-led Lunar Gateway program that aims to place laboratories on the moon. Canada will be developing a new Canadarm — the Canadarm3 — to help with construction and exploration on the moon, and will be investing $2 billion over the next 24 years in space exploration.

By The Canadian Press on February 27, 2019.

MONTREAL – Just For Laughs is assuring comics concerned by its takeover of a satellite radio comedy station that it will exclusively air Canadian content produced by artists outside of the Montreal entertainment company’s catalogue.

Canadian comedians have been crying foul over this week’s announced partnership between Just For Laughs and Sirius XM Canada to turn the Canada Laughs channel into Just For Laughs Radio, saying the move would deprive homegrown talent of a vital source of exposure and income.

Senior officials for the partner companies jointly announced Wednesday that the redubbed Just For Laughs Radio Canada would solely showcase independent Canadian comedians, who will be entitled to the same royalties as under the previous regime.

Just For Laughs president Bruce Hills and John Lewis, SiriusXM Canada’s senior vice-president of programing and operations, say the companies have been in contact the Canadian Association of Stand-up Comedians, which condemned the radio deal, about their plans for the channel.

The announcement walked back comments made by Canadian comedy legend Howie Mandel, who is part of the partnership that owns Just For Laughs, suggesting some of the station’s content would now be drawn from the Just For Laughs archives, which include performers from around the world.

Mandel insisted in a Facebook post Sunday that the station would continue to broadcast content from Canadian comedians, including up-and-coming performers, but it wasn’t long before backlash spread through Canada’s comedy scene.

“We’ve listened carefully to the concerns of Canadian artists and regret the stress we have caused the comedy community,” Hills said in a statement Wednesday.

“We are invested in the growth of Canada’s comedy industry and are working to include even more Canadian talent in all our initiatives.”

A spokeswoman for the CASC said the organization is excited with the decision.

“We look forward to continuing the discussion with Just For Laughs to develop new and exciting opportunities to support opportunities for Canadian comics,” Battaglini said in a statement.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin, The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons' Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec's pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec's current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October's federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she ""experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion"" over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau's cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs' department amid the fallout of the scandal.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,"" Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould's testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that ""a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.""

While Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau's approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

OTTAWA – While New Democrats are pleased to learn that the federal government has finally responded to the United Nations’ call for additional funding for humanitarian assistance in Yemen, they urge the Liberals to follow this funding with an immediate end to the arms trade with Saudi Arabia.

“As Canada joins the international community to provide desperately needed assistance in Yemen, it continues to export arms to Saudi Arabia, the chief instigator of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” says Linda Duncan, the NDP International Development Critic.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 80 percent of Yemenis – 24 million people – require some form of humanitarian assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need.

Sears, a long-time NDP strategist who runs Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa, one of the leading crisis-management firms in the country. “This is a moment when his integrity, his credibility, his future is on the line. To respond as arrogantly and flippantly and disrespectfully as he did tonight is not helpful.”

For decades, Watt and Sears have advised some of the most powerful companies and people around the world on how to survive public relations disasters. The veteran advisers, who regularly contribute to the Star’s Opinion section, offered their professional views of what Trudeau should have done, should have said and what he still must do to protect his office and the Liberal party in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

“You can see the hand of Justice Cromwell crafting her remarks,” Watt said. “He writes beautifully. Because she was so direct, I think she has created a problem for the prime minister. And the government will need to answer with equal clarity.”

Watt praised Wilson-Raybould’s lawyer — retired Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell — for bringing “extremely compelling” clarity to the former justice minister’s address to the Commons committee regarding the Prime Minister’s Office’s role in mediating criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.

“Here is a woman who is rising in public esteem daily and took a huge leap by virtue of her testimony today,” Sears said. “Trudeau reacted by appearing as if he were celebrating a byelection victory. It was just bizarre. It was tone deaf.”

What Raybould-Wilson told the House of Commons’ justice commitee about the pressure and persistent “veiled threats” she faced from Trudeau’s top officials is “profoundly critical of the character of this government,” Sears said.

Such a serious accusation demands a thoughtful response.

“Her case is pretty hard to challenge on the merits,” Sears said. “All that pressure from all those people over all that period of time — it’s hard to deny it was inappropriate. He should have said ‘I’m going to read my former attorney general’s remarks with care overnight and I’ll have a detailed reaction in the morning, but my initial reaction is I take a different view than she does about the degree to which she felt pressured.’ ”

3. Resist the urge to spin platitudes

It’s common for leaders in crisis to retreat to their “comfort zones” when they’re under public fire during a crisis, as Trudeau did during his late-night scrum with reporters in Montreal. But rattling off a series of “bumper-sticker” quotes is no way to do damage control, Watt said.

“The way they have to put their case forward is with no funny business. This is a time when spin and prevarication and the usual kind of rhetoric will be very ineffective at countering her. They actually have to employ legal-style communications, not just political-style communications if they’re going to bat down each of the points she made.”

4. Location, location, location

What Trudeau decides to say next is as important as where he says it.

“I think they would want to match the formalness of the setting (Wilson-Raybould) had,” Watt said, noting Trudeau has a few natural options. He could issue a statement in the House or the National Press Theatre or secure national television time to directly address the entire country. Watt said a formal television address is the way to go.

“She raised the stakes on this to a level of seriousness and gravity that he would have to match in his reply. These accusations go right to the heart of the integrity of the government that this requires the prime minister talking to the Canadian people.”

Sears is less specific, but agreed the Montreal scrum was a terrible move. “He should have done it in Ottawa. He should have done it outside the prime minister’s office.”

Sears said he thinks Trudeau has time to recover “tomorrow or later, but he’s got to show that he takes this seriously.” That message could resonate through an exclusive interview Trudeau could offer to a member of the media. “He needs to just talk about it; weigh the challenges a case like this presents between his obligation to be a champion of an important company on the one hand and on the other, how hard that is to navigate and how seriously he takes that. Something like that would help restore some perception that he understands that Canadians are not impressed by him claiming he did everything right when he didn’t.”

5. Another top Liberal official will need to fall

The resignation of Trudeau’s Principal Secretary, Gerald Butts, will not be enough to show the public that the federal government understands the magnitude of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Watt and Sears agreed.

Watt wouldn’t speculate on whose head would fall next, but Sears has a prediction based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.

“I think the clerk’s position (Michael Wernick) is pretty fragile,” he said. “Not only his testimony before the committee the other day, but the role he played that Jody outlined is pretty troubling. Political staff people misbehave, but the Clerk of the Privy Council is not expected to play that role.”

FARCE

It was a sad farce to watch Trudeau duck and weave in question period, refusing to answer the most simple questions on the SNC scandal, claiming to be standing up for policies that keep Canadians employed. At the same time he refused to meet with hundreds of Canadians, some who had driven thousands of miles on their own dime (not gifted to them by their grandfather in a trust fund BTW) to rightfully demand that his government reverse his policies that are killing thousands of jobs in the western Canadian energy sector. His claim to be a government that lives by the rule of law and in the interest of everyday Canadians, is clearly a sham as the evidence on SNC piles up and he is making Canada look foolish both domestically and on the international stage … again.

Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This bye-election win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the New Democratic Party shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the party’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the National Democratic Party persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the bye-election, the National Democratic Party would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the party in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, New Democratic Party fundraising – already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election – continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the New Democratic Party out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this bye-election win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the bye-election was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the party announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the New Democratic Party. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the New Democratic Party can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the New Democratic Party in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the New Democratic Party to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilised members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this bye-election win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

The Lead

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says he is trying to pursuade President Donald Trump that tariff rate quotas (TRQ) on Canadian and Mexican steel imports will be just as effective as plain tariffs, reports Reuters.

He made the comments during an appearance before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee hearing. Perdue was asked about the American steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products levelled in response.

“The president, we’re working hard to persuade him that the steel industry here, which is concerned, can be protected through a TRQ program here rather than tariffs and release the retaliatory tariffs,” he told the committee.

TRQs allow a certain amount of product to enter the country duty free, but anything above that total is subjected to tariffs. South Korea agreed to a tariff rate quota for 70 per cent of its steel exports to the U.S. in 2017.

Perdue said he has been advocating for the removal of tariffs on steel products from Canada and Mexico since all three Northern American countries signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement last year.

“The expectation was that the agreement would be signed and the tariffs would come off and that hasn’t happened but it’s in the best interest of all three countries to do the that,” he said.

In Canada

Dairy industry representatives are calling for federal support because of concessions made in recent trade deals, specifically the pan-Pacific trade pact, known as the CPTPP, the CETA deal with the European Union and USMCA agreement with Mexico and the United States, reports Farms.com.

Canada will lose 8.4 per cent of its domestic market share and $450 million in annual revenue to foreign dairy products because of these trade deals, and combined with pre-existing imports approved by the WTO, about 18 per cent of Canada’s dairy market will be filled by foreign products in five years, warned David Wiens, vice-president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada.

“These agreements will inhibit not only the sector’s ability to grow but also to maintain current market share,” he told the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry on Tuesday.

“This is eroding dairy farmers’ confidence in the future of our sector, particularly for our young farmers and lenders who have invested in assuming market growth.”

Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay is visiting Nova Scotia on Thursday, where he was to officially open a new research winery at the Kentville Research and Development Centre. It’s aimed at helping local grape growers and vintners “hone their production techniques to take full advantage of the province’s unique soils and growing conditions,” according to Agriculture and Agri-food Canada.

Around Town

Well, the talk of the town remains Jody Wilson-Raybould’s much anticipated testimony to the House justice committee, which certainly lived up to expectations, at least from a purely newsworthy perspective.

In her heavily hyped address, she accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior figures in the Trudeau government of conducting a “concerted” effort to politically interfere in the handling of the SNC-Lavalin case by the Public Prosecution Service. Wilson-Raybould, though, argued that there was no criminal wrongdoing in the matter, because she wouldn’t permit any political influence.

After her appearance, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau should resign, while Trudeau said he disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and refused to step down. On Thursday, Trudeau said he still needs to think about Wilson-Raybould’s future in the Liberal caucus. Charlie Pinkerton has this story.

The House Agriculture committee met earlier today to hear from representatives of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association and the National Farm Animal Care Council for its study on the “perception of and public trust in the Canadian agricultural sector.” It then went in-camera to discuss drafting instructions for a report on its study on support of Indigenous Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food industry and later address unspecified committee business.

The Senate Agriculture committee met earlier in the day as well to hear from the CEO of Nova Scotia cannabis producer Aqualitas for its study on how the value-added food sector can be more competitive in global markets. It also considered a draft report for its look on issues relating to agriculture and forestry generally.

The Canadian Federation of Agriculture‘s annual general meeting comes to a close today. Here’s the agenda for the conference that’s being held in Ottawa.

Internationally

Back to the U.S., struggling Wisconsin dairy farmers could flip their allegiances away from Trump in the 2020 election, reports Fortune.

Amidt the president’s trade wars, Wisconsin dairy farms are closing at what the news outlet called an unprecedented rate, with 700 shutting down just last year, or two daily.

While the state’s declining dairy sector largely backed Trump and allowed the Republican to flip Wisconsin from the Democrats in 2016, it could turn away from the president as tariffs on U.S. agriculture products rock the industry. Milk prices in the country are flirting with their lowest level in the last 50 years, according to reporting by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel cited by Fortune.

ICE canola futures dropped to fresh contract lows during the week ending Wednesday and there could be more losses on the horizon.

“Unfortunately the technicals and fundamentals are tremendously bearish,” said analyst Wayne Palmer of Exceed Grain Marketing, adding “fresh contract lows breed fresh contract lows.”

Without a deal between China and the U.S. to end their trade spate, Palmer expects the trend to drop lower in soybeans, “which would weigh on canola as well,” reports Glacier FarmMedia News.

252,World,2019-02-28T01:43:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA — Four Canadian unions helped fund a private delegation ... critic Hélène Laverdière said Monday she now accepts the Liberal government’s recognition of Guaido — just not how ...,"OTTAWA — Four Canadian unions helped fund a private delegation to observe the Venezuelan presidential election last year, even as Canada, the United States and President Nicolas Maduro’s opponents decried the results as illegitimate.

With many of Maduro’s opponents in jail or barred from running for office and the country’s legislative system already weakened under his rule, opposition leaders had urged international observers not to travel to Caracas to lend legitimacy to the May 2018 proceedings.

Eight months later, amid mass demonstrations and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, the legislative assembly’s leader, Juan Guaido, is trying to trigger a constitutional mechanism that allows for a challenge of illegitimate leadership. Canada, the U.S. and a host of Latin American and European countries have recognized Guaido as interim president, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bluntly accused Maduro of “dictatorship” Monday.

The group of six Canadian observers, among them representatives of Common Frontiers, Unifor, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF), the United Church of Canada and Rabble.ca, lauded Venezuela’s “strong and vibrant democracy,” however, in a report published by Common Frontiers after the May 2018 trip. United Steelworkers and a Toronto personal injury law firm, Carranza LLP, also provided “delegation support,” according to the report.

“We witnessed a transparent, secure, democratic and orderly electoral and voting process,” the document concludes. “Our delegation was impressed by the electoral process and felt confident that the results of the elections represent the will of the majority of Venezuelans who voted.”

Meanwhile, an Organization of American States panel of human rights experts conducted hearings last year and concluded Maduro’s regime should be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, including thousands of cases of murder, torture and imprisonment against the political opposition. Canada, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru did so in September.

“The notion that free and fair elections could possibly be taking place when you not only criminalize those who are on the opposition … but when you don’t have any allowance for expressions of freedom of speech, assembly, association and the like, simply is a non-sequitur,” said Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister who sat on the panel. “I think part of the problem with the labour groups who went down there is that they seem to be acting reflexively out of a political agenda rather than a human rights agenda. Out of a left-right agenda rather than a right-wrong approach.”

Alessandra Polga, a Venezuelan living in Canada who works on behalf of Venezuelan political prisoners, said she is concerned about “aggressive” left-wing groups advocating for Maduro’s regime in Canada.

Common Frontiers, which organized the delegation and issued the report, claims “active” support from a long list of labour groups, including the Canadian Union of Public Employees. Its website invites supporters to petition the Canadian government against leading the Lima Group, which saw the foreign ministers of Canada, Brazil, Argentina and eight other countries convene in Ottawa Monday to discuss support for Guaido.

CUPE provides funding to Common Frontiers as part of “global justice work,” said spokesman Hugh Pouliot, which in recent years was largely focused on the renegotiation of NAFTA. A source inside a public-sector union said such groups are usually run independently and have a contact person within each union.

A recent statement from CUPE on the Venezuelan situation was in line with Common Frontiers’ position, however. It said Maduro was “duly elected” and criticized the Canadian government for helping Guaido organize a “coup d’état.” Pouliot said he was not aware of any pushback from members as a result of the statement.

Asked on Monday to respond to fears on the left that Canada is facilitating imperialism, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said she finds the idea difficult to justify and hers is a pro-democracy position. The NDP, which had been hitherto agnostic, clarified its own position when foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière said Monday she now accepts the Liberal government’s recognition of Guaido — just not how they went about it.

The National Post reached Raul Burbano of Common Frontiers Monday but he did not respond to questions. The Post made efforts to seek comment from all organizations that sent delegates or lent financial support but not all responded.

The United Church provided $1,500 to help with costs, according to spokeswoman Catherine Rodd, but their Latin America program’s Jim Hodgson, who was part of the delegation, was unavailable Monday. Hodgson wrote favourably about the trip for Rabble.ca at the end of May and questioned why Canada would not defend Venezuelan sovereignty against “U.S. aggression.”

CUPW provided financial support for Don Foreman’s travels, which included meetings with the Venezuelan postal workers union — but he was there “on behalf of Common Frontiers,” according to the union. “While groups such as the Lima Group (led) by Canada are screaming fraud and government interference in the election process, not one shred of evidence has been produced to back up such claims,” Foreman is quoted as saying in the report.

The OSSTF representative is quoted saying Canadians could “learn a lot” from the way elections are conducted in Venezuela, and the Rabble.ca representative is quoted saying it should be an “international gold standard.” Neither organization responded to the Post’s request for comment. United Steelworkers referred the Post to Burbano.

Elizabeth May says the NDP government’s “Keep Canada Working” campaign centered around the controversial pipeline project is misleading.

“Canadians deserve to know the facts about the cost of the Kinder Morgan pipeline,” May said.

“The Notley government’s ‘Keep Canada Working’ ads exaggerate the economic benefits and hide the many risks. This pipeline is a liability any way you look at it.”

May said the Trans Mountain pipeline will create 90 permanent jobs, not thousands of jobs as indicated by the Alberta government.

“The delay to the Kinder Morgan pipeline costs the country of Canada about $40 million a day and there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said last April.

Alberta’s NDP government said the expansion will help sustain good paying jobs for thousands of Canadians.

“The Conference Board of Canada has estimated that the project would result in 37,000 jobs across Canada,” a government statement to Global News read.

“Fifteen-thousand new jobs will be created during project construction. Thirteen-hundred annual full-time marine sector jobs will be created during operation.”

READ MORE: Workers left in limbo as construction on Trans Mountain pipeline stops

Trans Mountain said there were 2,000 people working on the pipeline before the Federal Court of Appeal struck down the project’s original approval last summer, citing issues over the impact on marine life and Indigenous consultation.

The company said it expected the project would employ 5,000 workers by the middle of the year had it not been postponed.

The Green Party leader also suggested the safest way to transport bitumen is as a solid by rail rather than by pipeline.

“The only way to transport bitumen, which is a solid, through a pipeline is mixing it with a toxic diluent,” the party’s statement read. “When that mixture spills it’s impossible to clean up.”

“I am often asked: ‘Doesn’t Canada have truth in advertising laws?’ We do, but the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards doesn’t apply to government paid advertising for political issues,” May said. “The Alberta ad campaign demonstrates that it should.”

On Feb. 19, Notley announced the province was spending $3.7 billion to move landlocked oil to market by rail.

The province said transporting oil by rail cars is more expensive, less efficient and less environmentally-friendly than by pipeline.

“We could be getting so much more out of our products then we do, but instead, we are forced to curtail production and lease rail cars to move our product,” a government statement read.

READ MORE: Notley cautiously calls NEB Trans Mountain decision a step in the right direction

Last week, the National Energy Board conditionally approved the Trans Mountain expansion and made 16 new recommendations to the Governor in Council.

The NEB said the project could cause environmental harm but that the benefits of the pipeline outweigh the effects.

“We’re pleased that we got a recommendation to the federal cabinet and that we can hopefully see them move forward in a timely way,” Notley said.

Notley said she is not expecting the federal cabinet to approve the pipeline before the next provincial election, which by law has to happen before the end of May.

The Trans Mountain expansion would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to the B.C. coast for export to overseas markets.

According to documents obtained by Global News, Keep Canada Working is a national advertising campaign with multiple messaging arms for different parts of the country.

In January, the province told Global News $23.4 million had been spent on the Keep Canada Working campaign out the total budget of $31 campaign committed to the campaign.

The money is going towards television, radio, print, online and billboard ads that tout the Trans Mountain Pipeline as a project that would boost Canada’s economy and create jobs.

The Alberta government said the campaign is having an impact.

“Before the campaign started roughly four in 10 Canadians agreed that we need new pipelines. Now that number is almost seven in 10,” the province’s statement read.

“We continue to see more news confirming increased awareness of the topic and that the vast majority of Canadians agree our lack of pipelines is a crisis and we need to get pipelines built.

The native of Thornhill, Ont., shot a 4-under 66 to put him two shots back of two-time RBC Canadian Open champion Jhonattan Vegas of Venezuela.

The 31-year-old Silverman, who got into the tournament early this week as an alternate, was tied with Americans Zach Johnson and Lucas Glover and Ernie Els of South Africa.

""Me and my caddie have a great strategy for this week for kind of moving forward,"" Silverman told reporters.

""We've picked a style of swing that is comfortable for me, and we just move my targets for wind, and I think that helped hit more fairways, and when I missed greens, I was missing because we had a better club in hand and I had a slightly easier up-and-down where I could bump it into a low spot. I was never short-sided.""

Silverman, who started on hole No. 10, bogeyed his first hole before reeling off four birdies on his front nine. He had two birdies and a bogey on his final nine holes.

A Florida Atlantic University product, Silverman has been living in the state for 13 years.

""It's really comfortable. It's like a second home. I've been here since '06, and I'm 31, so it's almost half my life I've been down here really, so I'm used to the weather, I'm used to the Bermuda (grass), the style of course, and I've played this course a ton of times — mini-tour events plus Q-school.""

Silverman, who secured his PGA Tour card for the second year in a row at the final event of the Web.com Tour season last year, has made the cut in five of eight events on the top circuit this year. But his best finish is just a tie for 39th.

Story continues

""I'm slowly getting more comfortable out here,"" he said. ""I know the courses now, so I'm working more on my game in the practice area and less on practice rounds, and I think it's going to pay off moving forward.""

Monday qualifier Drew Nesbitt of Shanty Bay, Ont., and Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., each shot 1-over 71, Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., and Adam Svensson of Surrey, B.C., had 72 and Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., carded a 76.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys to tkae the early lead.

""Hit my irons the best I've hit them all year and I've always liked this golf course,"" Vegas said. ""It's kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.""

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

""To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it's great,"" Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed ""Bear Trap"" stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

""I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,"" Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that's not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

""We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,"" Johnson said. ""The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don't think we're going to get Honda wind until Sunday.""

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

""Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,"" Els said. ""It's late in my career, but I'll take any win now.""

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That's when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn't believe it'll impact him Friday.

""Just more of a shock than anything,"" Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

""It's a great round, at the end of the day,"" Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his last four rounds at the Honda, he's 7 over on that hole. ... Alex Cejka was disqualified for using an improper greens-reading device, officials said. He withdrew from last year's tournament and missed the cut in 2017. ... Cody Gribble had an interesting day — making quadruple bogey on No. 6, triple bogey on the par-4 11th, and then eagle on the par-5 18th. He shot a 77.

It’s a day dedicated to ...","For nearly a year, the light in Logan Boulet’s childhood bedroom has been carefully turned on each morning and turned out each night. The 21-year-old was one of 16 people killed last April when the Humboldt Broncos hockey team bus he was riding in collided with a semi-truck.

“The other day, I’m pretty sure I turned the light off because I was looking for something in his room and it was just a habit,” Logan’s sister, Mariko, explained. “My dad noticed immediately, and he was like, ‘Who turned off this light?’ Because it’s such a presence we’ve had in our house the past 10 months.”

The Lethbridge family has always been a tight-knit group. He was close with his parents — Bernadine and Toby are well-known teachers in the southern Alberta community. He was also close with his sister, Mariko, who is three years older.

“They did lots together. In May of 2017, they went on a big adventure to Paris on their own. We dropped them off at the airport in Calgary and away they went. They organized it all,” Bernadine Boulet said.

Mariko, an occupational therapy student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, deferred a practicum for several months so she could remain close by her parents but as they grieve together, the three surviving Boulets are also navigating a new role: they’ve become advocates for organ donation.

“When Logan passed and Bernie offered his organs, from that moment on I feel that we have to continue the work that Logan started,” said Toby Boulet.

Logan died in hospital a day after the bus crash. His parents say they knew organ donation was something their son believed in and offered his organs before doctors could even ask.

Logan’s heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and corneas have gone on to save or improve the lives of six people across Canada. According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, in 2016, 256 Canadians died waiting for an organ, and at the end of the year 4,469 were awaiting an organ transplant.

WATCH: It’s been almost 11 months since 16 lives were lost in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash. Lethbridge’s Logan Boulet was one of the young men killed. Since his passing, he’s inspired thousands of people from across Canada to consider organ donation. Matt Battochio explains how his family continues to uphold his legacy.

The Boulets said they knew that donating Logan’s organs would help others but they were stunned by what happened next. In the days and weeks that followed, tens of thousands of people joined organ donation registries across the country in what came to be known as the “Logan Boulet effect.”

Nearly 100,000 Canadians signed up to become organ donors after learning he had signed his own card. Canadian Blood Services said there were 99,742 registrations in April alone — a number that only included provinces with online registration: British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island.

“It’s been heartwarming,” Bernie said, “to meet some of the people who have been recipients because you know what a difference it’s made in their lives.”

Since then, the Boulets have been asked to speak at events in support of organ donation across the country.

“Back in November, I spoke at the Northern Alberta and Territories Kidney Foundation dinner,” Mariko said. “It was difficult, but I received a standing ovation — not for me — for my brother’s story. It was amazing to see how much Logan’s stories have impacted these people and then to have the opportunity to have all these people come up and share their transplant stories.”

On April 7, the day Logan passed away, the Boulet family is launching Green Shirt Day in conjunction with the Canadian Transplant Association and Canadian Blood Services. It’s a day dedicated to promoting organ donation awareness, while honouring the Logan Boulet effect.

“To put it on April 7, the day we lost Logan, it means a lot and I think it will make it less difficult for that day when it comes,” said Mariko.

“I’m super proud of him. I always was proud of him when he was here, even if I never told him that all the time — but just seeing what he’s created and what he’s left behind is incredible.”

He rejects it unreservedly, calling the film “a complete lie.”

Richard Armin is a cellist who used to play with Don Shirley, the musician featured in Green Book, the new Oscar Best Picture winner. ( Richard Lautens / Toronto Star )

“I feel betrayed,” says Armin, 74, in an interview in his Queen St. E. apartment. “It almost brought me to tears.” For eight months in 1964-65, Armin worked with Don Shirley, the virtuoso Black pianist at the centre of the film. Armin, a cellist who would later find fame working with Toronto band Lighthouse and other Canadian rock acts, was just 20 when he signed on in September 1964 to work with the Don Shirley Trio, a concert ensemble then winning raves for its innovative approach to classical, folk and pop music. The road trip included stops in racially divided U.S. southern states, as in Green Book, as well as a Canadian leg that took in Barrie, Kingston, Montreal and Sherbrooke, Que.

During the tour, Armin did double duty as Shirley’s driver. That’s why he feels able to weigh in on Green Book’s accuracy. The film, said to be based on a true story, tells the tale of Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, and his white driver, Tony “Lip” Vallelonga, a racist New York bar bouncer played by Viggo Mortensen, as they tour the Deep South in 1962, an era when signs on washroom doors still read “Whites Only.” Armin finds particular fault with the way Ali, who won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar Sunday for his role as Shirley, plays the concert pianist as a snobbish prima donna, so uptight and out of touch with popular culture that he’s barely aware of Black icons like Aretha Franklin and Little Richard. Armin doesn’t recognize this portrayal of his former boss. Contrary to Green Book’s aloof and distant Shirley, which members of the pianist’s family have called “a symphony of lies,” Armin says the real thing loved to talk and he knew a lot about culture — Black, white and everything else. “For me, I had never encountered anybody like this in terms of intellect and loquacity. He was a great talker, a beautiful talker. I could never tire of his talking and he talked incessantly. He read me the entire works of James Baldwin while we were driving. He was filled with beautiful accounts of Black history. He had been close friends with Baldwin before Baldwin moved to France.” The pianist could, Armin allows, be “very strict” and occasionally nasty in his treatment of fellow musicians and employees but he was also exceedingly encouraging and generous. He paid Armin $250 US per week in cash — a handsome sum in those days — and also bought him a sharp new suit and winter coat.

“He wanted me to be presentable, and I was just out of school, so what did I know? I had Ban-Lon shirts and clip-on ties, and he would have none of that. He was a very classy guy.” Spending many hours on the road with Shirley was a life-changing experience for Armin, born into a Mennonite family in a small Manitoba town and barely finished with studying music at Indiana University stateside when a colleague there recommended him to Shirley.

He credits Shirley with teaching him how to be professional, including the importance of being on time. When Armin showed up late once for a gig, Shirley responded by buying him a nice Bulova wristwatch, which he stills wears. Prior to meeting Shirley, Armin says he had very little knowledge of Black culture and the racial issues embroiling the U.S. Shirley “educated me on Black culture and how the understanding of culture is limitless in terms of race,” Armin says. While driving Shirley in the Southern U.S., he says they experienced no incidents of overt racism like those in the film. Although he and Shirley often stayed in different hotels or motels while touring, the two were frequently invited together to dinner at the homes of Black fans of the Don Shirley Trio, which actually was a quartet when Armin was with it. Armin may not have witnessed acts of racism, but he was certainly aware of how race hatred permeated society: “I remember one of my cello teachers telling me, ‘Negroes can’t play the cello. They should not be in symphonies, they should not do classical music.’ That was the going thing in those days.” Armin’s beefs with Green Book run deep. The film picked up another award at the 91st Oscars on Sunday for Best Original Screenplay, and Armin jokes that the “original” part is certainly appropriate. “My biggest complaint is that there was no research done. There couldn’t have been. Whoever wrote this could not have known Don Shirley or even been in his presence.” The screenplay is mainly credited to Nick Vallelonga, Tony’s son, who insists it’s based on his father’s real-life experiences with Shirley, who he says remained a family friend until Don and Tony died in 2013. (Green Book director Peter Farrelly and writer/actor Brian Hayes Currie are credited as co-writers.) Armin hadn’t seen the film prior to it winning Best Picture. He knew what the movie was about — his ex-wife had told him about it — but he was immediately put off by the poster art showing Shirley in the back seat of a green Cadillac. He figured the film would be just another Hollywood reinvention of the truth. Shirley “wouldn’t be caught dead in a green car, or in anything other than his leased black Lincoln Continental,” Armin says. And what a car that Lincoln was: “My God, it was gorgeous,” Armin recalls. “I just loved driving that car. It had ample space in the back. It even had a keyboard in the back that Don could play.” Armin finally watched Green Book on DVD the night before our interview this week, and was shocked to find the factual liberties taken were far greater than he’d imagined. We watched a few scenes together, and Armin remarked at how Mortensen’s “thuggish” portrayal of Tony Vallelonga — whom Armin never met — further eroded reality. “I can’t see Don having any patience with a man like that, any patience. He would not have tolerated the talkback.” You’d have every reason to think that, given Armin’s loyalty to his former boss, that the two remained on good terms ever after. Yet the two parted on unhappy terms in the spring of 1965, just as that season’s tour of the Don Shirley Trio was wrapping up stateside. Armin failed to pick up Shirley for a post-concert party — he accepts the blame, but says he’d been given wrong info — and an enraged Shirley fired him on the spot. Armin was later forced to sign a termination agreement with a lawyer, where he received his final $250 cash payment. “I was devastated,” Armin recalls of the firing. “But I learned how this (music) business is done. You screw up, and you’re done. And I have no hard feelings towards Don. My heart goes out to his family.” Peter Howell is the Star's movie critic based in Toronto.

Canada’s Ben Silverman was tied for second after the morning wave during the first round of the PGA Tour’s Honda Classic.

The native of Thornhill, Ont., shot a 4-under 66 to put him two shots back of two-time RBC Canadian Open champion Jhonattan Vegas of Venezuela.

The 31-year-old Silverman, who got into the tournament early this week as an alternate, was tied with American Zach Johnson and Ernie Els of South Africa.

“Me and my caddy have a great strategy for this week for kind of moving forward,” Silverman told reporters.

“We’ve picked a style of swing that is comfortable for me, and we just move my targets for wind, and I think that helped hit more fairways, and when I missed greens, I was missing because we had a better club in hand and I had a slightly easier up-and-down where I could bump it into a low spot. I was never short-sided.”

Silverman, who started on hole No. 10, bogeyed his first hole before reeling off four birdies on his front nine. He had two birdies and a bogey on his final nine holes.

A Florida Atlantic University product, Silverman has been living in the state for 13 years.

“It’s really comfortable. It’s like a second home. I’ve been here since ‘06, and I’m 31, so it’s almost half my life I’ve been down here really, so I’m used to the weather, I’m used to the Bermuda (grass), the style of course, and I’ve played this course a ton of times – minitour events plus Q-school.”

Silverman, who secured his PGA Tour card for the second year in a row at the final event of the Web.com Tour season last year, has made the cut in five of eight events on the top circuit this year. But his best finish is just a tie for 39th.

“I’m slowly getting more comfortable out here,” he said. “I know the courses now, so I’m working more on my game in the practice area and less on practice rounds, and I think it’s going to pay off moving forward.”

The new program will see businesses become international players in solving sustainability concerns

Calling all green energy innovators: with support from various levels of government, the Cleantech Scale-Up Program is seeking Western Canadian tech companies specializing in clean power. The program aims to give them a clear path to mass-marketing and exporting their products and services.

Through Alacrity, a not-for-profit that promotes tech entrepreneurship, Canadian companies are paired with strategic partners across the globe to identify gaps and fill them with Canadian solutions.

“In the last year, we’ve been able to help attract nearly $10 million of investment for companies participating in the program,” Richard Egli, managing director of Alacrity, said in a statement. “Over the past eight months, our global team has identified over 40 multimillion-dollar cleantech projects that need innovative solutions, and now we’re looking to find viable technology here in B.C.”

Alacrity believes B.C. companies can help with projects in various international markets seeking solutions for storing and sourcing renewable energy, recycling systems, biomass conversion and other sustainable technologies. These efforts need partners that can start right away and, ideally, complete the work within 10 to 12 months.

The Cleantech Scale-Up Program’s goal is to attract growth capital to Canada while boosting companies’ exports. Participating B.C. businesses can make a difference by solving urgent problems abroad as they create jobs at home.

Alacrity is looking for new partners, too. To help Canadian cleantech companies working overseas navigate regulations and access capital, the non-profit seeks to join forces with local governments and non-governmental organizations in other countries.",Canadian cleantech companies encouraged to go global,BCBusiness,https://www.bcbusiness.ca/Canadian-cleantech-companies-encouraged-to-go-global

The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency is taking comments from the public and Indigenous groups to decide whether or not an environmental assessment is required for the facility.

It's weighing an assessment because of the proposed facility's size — 17.5 kilometres of track for heavy and light duty maintenance bays. It will cover a 226,700-square-metre area, approximately double the size of Southcentre Mall.

The storage yard will be located near 128th Avenue S.E., just north of Shepard Station which will mark the southernmost end of the LRT line's first stage, and will be big enough to store and service 99 vehicles.

Right now, the city is looking to purchase between 40 and 45 vehicles for the Green Line.

Renee Summers with the City of Calgary said the federal agency also recommended Indigenous consultations be done, so the city has sent letters to 21 groups — eight of which have responded.

""They had no specific concerns [that were] project-related,"" Summers said.

""A couple of them asked about archaeological finds, so if there were any artifacts found they wanted to make sure they would be protected … there's no previous historical findings that relate that property to any Indigenous groups, so there was nothing found historically that connects it.""

City of Calgary More

She said any artifacts that are found will be recovered during construction.

The site is an industrial area that used to be farmland, dating back to the 1940s, and isn't near residential communities.

The city's environmental assessment suggests the facility will likely have a minimal environmental impact.

The $4.65-billion Green Line will use low floor cars, so it will require a different rail line and separate maintenance facility than the current high-floor light rail cars.

City of Calgary More

The facility will house:

Maintenance bays.

Light rail vehicle servicing areas like a cleaning platform and wash bays.

A body repair and paint shop.

A test track.

A light rail vehicle storage barn.

An admin building and staff area.

Parking.

The agency is accepting written comments by email or mail until March 3, and will then decide whether or not further review is needed.

Construction on the facility is slated to start next year and the Green Line will begin service in 2026.

The public transit line will ultimately stretch 46 kilometres across 28 stations from 160th Avenue North to Seton in southeast Calgary.",Calgary's Green Line storage barn will be so big it may need federal environmental assessment,Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/calgary-apos-green-line-storage-120000147.html

The last five years have seen Weir fall from being a PGA Tour regular to cobbling together an inconsistent schedule.","

Adam Stanley, The Canadian Press





Most golfers on the Web.com Tour don't get to play Augusta National on their weeks off.

Mike Weir is the exception, however.

The 2003 Masters champion is planning on playing a full schedule on the PGA Tour's feeder circuit thanks to a special exemption category for golfers aged 48-49 -- which should mark the first time he's played more than 20 events since 2014.

The 48-year-old native of Brights Grove, Ont. played three weeks in a row on the Web.com Tour in February -- with his best result a tie for 35th at the LECOM Suncoast Classic, after being tied for the lead early in the week in Lakewood Ranch, Fla.

Before returning home to Utah for a rest, though, Weir took a trip to Augusta to check out the new par-4 fifth hole (it has been lengthened for 2019) and enjoy two days of golf with friends. He'll tee it up again at the Masters in April.

""It's always great to get back there,"" said Weir, the lone Canadian to win a green jacket.

The last five years have seen Weir fall from being a PGA Tour regular to cobbling together an inconsistent schedule.

He's battled a myriad of injuries but told The Canadian Press he feels ""great"" for the first time in recent memory. He says he's more motivated than ever to get back to the top tour.

Weir said it was hard to get into a rhythm the last few years not knowing where he was going to play next, but now that he's got a confirmed schedule, he's eager to keep the competitive juice flowing.

""That's the benefit of playing week to week. You get to figure things out on the golf course, not the driving range at home,"" he said. ""You figure those things out when you're playing, so that's been nice.""

Weir said he's focused on trying to finish inside the top 25 in the Web.com Tour standings to earn a PGA Tour card for next year.

""I want to get back out there,"" said Weir, who is two years away from playing PGA Tour Champions (for golfers aged 50-plus).

Weir said he'd play the whole season on the Web.com Tour while leaving for the Masters -- he has a lifetime exemption thanks to his 2003 triumph -- and the RBC Canadian Open. He said he might play a few more PGA Tour events if possible.

He was exempt into last week's Puerto Rico Open on the PGA Tour, but decided to head home after playing three weeks in a row.

Weir has got a good look at the future of Canadian golf on the Web.com Tour. He played a practice round with Michael Gligic the week before the fellow Canadian won the Panama Championship.

""There are lots of guys playing well and hopefully there will be more and more,"" said Weir.

One of the golfers Weir mentioned is David Hearn, who tied for 25th at the Puerto Rico Open. Hearn was paired with Weir at the Desert Classic earlier this year on the PGA Tour and said he was impressed at how much better Weir was playing.

Returning to play a full schedule on the Web.com Tour, Hearn said, really characterizes who Weir is.

""For some people it might be a surprising but if you know Mike and you know how committed and how hard he's worked at the game in his lifetime, it's no surprise to a lot of guys out here,"" Hearn said.

Off the course, Weir was recently involved with a legal matter with the owner of his former winery. The Canadian Press reported the corporation Mike Weir Wine Inc. owes the golfer about $2.2 million.

Weir believes all will be resolved soon.

""It'll be behind me, which is all I have to say about that,"" said Weir.

As for golf, Weir said it's been ""refreshing"" playing on the Web.com Tour, despite the small crowds and trips to places like Panama and Colombia.

He said he's felt inspired playing with and competing against the next generation of PGA Tour stars.

""I'm competing and wanting to win and wanting to beat them, but I want them to play well and do well on the tour and get out there on the PGA Tour, because that's their dream,"" he said. ""I was there a long time ago and it's really been fun for me to be back out there.""

SLOAN SOLID IN PUERTO RICO

Roger Sloan notched his best career PGA Tour finish Sunday in Puerto Rico.

A 5-under-par 67 moved Sloan up 12 spots on the leaderboard as the native of Merritt, B.C., tied for second.

Earlier this week the company announced that, ""its collaborative research partnership with the University of British Columbia (""UBC ...","NEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2019 /CNW/ -- The shift from diesel-powered vehicles to fully electric and more environmentally efficient vehicles is already taking place. Recent consumer trends in the automotive industry have shown that many electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are already seeing increased sales. Other large automotive players in the industry are also transitioning from their current portfolio of gas-powered vehicles into a more fully electric production line. The abundance of EVs is partly attributable to the growing concerns regarding the environment as well as government initiatives imposing the transition. EVs are predominately powered by lithium-ion batteries, which are a lightweight and high-energy density solution. They provide the highest energy density per weight and are commonly used in phones, computers, as well as hybrid automobiles. According to data compiled by Grand View Research, the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to reach USD 93.1 Billion by 2025, while registering a robust CAGR of 17% as well. The EV market is expected to be a major driver for the overall lithium-ion battery, as well as the battery's growing adoption in portable consumer electronics and grid storage systems is expected to accelerate the market. MGX Minerals Inc. (OTC: MGXMF) (CSE: XMG), FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE: HMC), Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F)

Various nations have already moved to adopt clean environmental legislation, which would ban the use of gas-powered vehicles. Several European nations, such as Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have already implemented regulations which are expected to take in place in the coming years. Despite the global movement, the Asia Pacific region is expected to continue its domination of the market. In 2016, the region accounted for 48.3% of the global share, primarily led India and China. The two countries are expected to see the amount of EVs rise due to the implementation of these progressive government policies. ""As automakers ramp up production for evermore EVs, demand on the power grid from EVs will grow exponentially. According to best estimates, growth in EV adoption could drive a 300-fold increase in electricity consumption by 2040, compared to 2016. The current grid will need to evolve significantly to accommodate that growth, driving a blitz of new innovation in wind and solar power, which will ultimately shift global reliance on coal toward clean energy alternatives,"" according to a Thomson Reuters research report.

MGX Minerals Inc. (OTCQB: MGXMF) (CSE: XMG) is also listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker (CSE: XMG). Earlier this week the company announced that, ""its collaborative research partnership with the University of British Columbia (""UBC"") has completed a comprehensive baseline assessment of metallurgical silicon originating from each of the Company's three silicon projects in southeastern British Columbia. MGX and UBC are working together to develop next-generation Li-ion batteries capable of quadrupling energy density from current 100 Wh/kg up to 400 Wh/kg for use in long-range electric vehicles and grid storage.

With the Phase One assessment completed, Phase two of the collaborative is now underway and will focus on developing a scalable process to upgrade metallurgical silicon originating from MGX's projects to battery-grade silicon anode. The developed silicon anode will serve as a viable replacement over the present graphite anode and enable higher-energy-density lithium-ion batteries for numerous applications, including electric vehicles, grid storage, telecommunication, wireless sensors and more.

About the Research Initiative: The objective of the MGX/UBC research consortium is to develop a low-cost and scalable method that will fabricate a silicon-based anode to improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries. The two-year research program seeks to focus on 1) fabricating nanostructured silicon using low-cost metallurgical silicon as a feedstock and 2) compositing nanostructured silicon with commercial graphite to develop a high-performance silicon anode. The initial goal of the research is to replace the graphite anode with silicon and complete a hybrid in the short-term which will not require industry retooling. The ultimate goal is to enable next-generation Li-ion batteries capable of quadrupling energy density from current 100 Wh/kg up to 400 Wh/kg for use in long-range electric vehicles and grid storage.

Dr. Jian Liu, Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering at UBC Okanagan, is leading a research group focused on advanced materials for energy storage. Dr. Liu was previously the technical lead for development of surface coating materials by atomic and molecular layer deposition, and their applications in surface and interface engineering on the anode and cathode of Li-ion batteries and beyond, at Western University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

MGX Silicon Projects: MGX operates three silicon projects in southeastern British Columbia- Koot, Wonah and Gibraltar. A one-ton sample of quartzite from the Company's Gibraltar project was recently shipped to the independent lab Dorfner Anzaplan (""Dorfner"") in Germany for mineralogical analyses. Dorfner conducted X-ray diffraction analysis, chemical analyses through X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, grain size distribution, mineral processing analysis, automated optical sorting and thermal stability testing. Results indicated that the material, after comminution and classification fraction, is of high initial purity (99.5 wt.-%), making the fraction chemically suitable as medium quality feedstock material for metallurgical-grade silicon production.

Consistent with its strategy, Livent is focused on strengthening its partnerships with the largest and fastest growing lithium hydroxide customers globally. Paul Graves, President and Chief Executive Officer of Livent Corporation said, ""We delivered revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 in-line with our prior expectations. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect revenue growth in the high teens percentage, driven largely by higher volumes and a stable pricing environment. The results of our year-end negotiations with customers outside of China for 2019 were in-line with our expectations,"" added Graves. ""The majority of these customers committed to prices in-line with or higher than 2018. However, as has been widely noted, Chinese economic conditions weakened very late in 2018 and our lithium hydroxide customers in China were unwilling to make firm commitments for price and volume at levels that were acceptable to us. Therefore, Livent elected to increase its volume commitments to customers outside of China, particularly in South Korea and Japan, and as a result we expect our volumes in China to remain flat.""

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan. Committed to supporting human rights and environmental protection while helping infuse more transparency into global mineral supply chains, Ford Motor Company, Huayou Cobalt, IBM (NYSE: IBM), LG Chem and RCS Global announced plans to use blockchain technology to trace and validate ethically sourced minerals. The group, which includes participants at each major stage of the supply chain from mine to end-user, will begin with a pilot focused on cobalt and explore the creation of an open, industrywide blockchain platform that could ultimately be used to trace and validate a range of minerals used in consumer products. Cobalt is in high demand for its use in lithium-ion batteries, which power a wide range of products such as laptops, mobile devices and electric vehicles. According to a report from Morgan Stanley, by 2026, demand is expected to multiply eightfold, especially for its use in electric vehicles and consumer devices. The typical electric car battery requires up to 20 pounds of cobalt and a standard laptop requires around one ounce of the mineral. The blockchain pilot is already underway and seeks to demonstrate how materials in the supply chain are responsibly produced, traded and processed. For this pilot based on a simulated sourcing scenario, Cobalt produced at Huayou's industrial mine site in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will be traced through the supply chain as it travels from mine and smelter to LG Chem's cathode plant and battery plant in South Korea, and finally into a Ford plant in the United States. An immutable audit trail will be created on the blockchain, which will include corresponding data to provide evidence of the cobalt production from mine to end manufacturer.

Hopefully, with this agreement and favorable legislation ...","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 27, 2019 /CNW/ -- Lifestyle Delivery Systems Inc. (CSE: LDS), (OTCQX: LDSYF), (Frankfurt: LD6, WKN: A14XHT) (""LDS"" or the ""Company"") is proud to announce that as of Tuesday, February 27, 2019, Lifestyle Delivery Systems Inc. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enter into a Joint Venture (the ""JV"") with National Green Biomed Ltd (""NGB""). The JV will build a manufacturing facility in Mission, British Columbia, Canada to produce CannaStrips™.

Under the terms of the proposed JV agreement, NGB will provide an extension of its Rosebud Health Canada License to the JV and land for the new facility to manufacture CannaStrips™. Upon completion of a definitive agreement, LDS will invest a total of CAD$255,000 in a private placement for shares of common stock of NGB at $0.30 per share. LDS will contribute funds for the permits, design and build-out of the facility. NGB will receive a royalty on all sales from the Mission facility, more specifically a 5% royalty for sales in Canada and a 3% royalty on all sales outside of Canada. The Mission facility will be required to purchase raw material from NGB and provide custom processing for future products or business opportunities presented by NGB.

The Company's CEO, Brad Eckenweiler, commented, ""We are a Canadian company, our medical research team is Canadian, and our ultimate goal has always been to produce CannaStrips™ in Canada. Hopefully, with this agreement and favorable legislation, one day CannaStrips™ will be shipped around the globe. We look forward to working with the NGB team. They are extremely talented and well-positioned to move the CannaStrips™ project forward both in Canada and globally. I believe the CannaStrips™ technology, a discreet, smokeless, and odourless system, permits the formulation to be consumed in any situation, overcoming the challenges associated with traditional cannabis consumption and concerns of unintended sharing with others nearby. That combination makes CannaStrips™ a responsible alternative for the Canadian market.""

The availability of CannaStrips™ in Canada has not yet been determined; the Company will keep its shareholders apprised of the Company's progress on this project.

Nancy Greene Raine will be part of the celebration taking place Friday and Saturday.

Greene Raine is best-known for the winning the Olympic and World Championship gold medals in Grenoble, France in 1968.

What she enjoys most about the sport is how inclusive it is to all age groups and skill levels.

“One of the things that keeps me so enthusiastic about skiing is seeing that its a sport and an endeavor that can be enjoyed on a casual weekend basis by kids from the little toddlers right up until the grandparents.”

“I am coming to check out the Hart Ski Hill area and do a little fundraising dinner for them. It’s very unique to have a little ski hill like that, it’s not a big hill but it’s a great place to learn and is in right within the city limits.”

Greene Raine spoke with My PG Now touching on her dominance at the World and Olympic stage 51 years ago.

“You know the gold medal I had is the biggest impact I had on the general public because everybody is watching the Olympics for ski racers, but for ski racers themselves the biggest race for them is the world cup, which is what I won the first two times.”

The champion alpine skier was voted Canada’s Female Athlete of the 20th Century.

“On the bargaining table and in our communities, postal workers are demanding climate leadership and better public services that improve the lives of everyone in this country,” said Tim Armstrong, National Director for the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), Pacific Region. “We’re showing the people what’s possible if we use our postal service for the common good.”

CUPW is a member of the Delivering Community Power coalition, which is campaigning to use Canada’s vast network of post offices to build a greener and fairer society.

Among the ideas proposed by the Delivering Community Power campaign:

Electric vehicle charging stations at post offices;

Converting the postal fleet to made-in-Canada electric vehicles;

Assistance to vulnerable people via check-ins on seniors and those with limited mobility;

Public financial services as a means of financial inclusion and green investment; and

Delivery of groceries and medicines.

Many of these ideas were presented by CUPW during their negotiations with Canada Post and will be presented during arbitration hearings.

Materials stocks were off by 0.75 per cent as Turquoise Hill dropped 11.5 per cent, Kinross Gold fell 2.23 per cent and Barrick Gold was off 0.5 per cent as it continues with its hostile bid for Newmont Mining.

Gold prices held steady on Wednesday, consolidating in a tight range, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish stance on monetary policy offering limited support.

Energy stocks were the sole gainers, up 0.1 per cent with Secure Energy up 5 per cent and Whitecap Resources up 3 per cent.

Shares in Torstar gained nearly 17 per cent despite it reporting a loss in its latest quarter. However, adjusted earnings came in at 15 cents per share, higher than the nine cents analysts expected.

U.S. stocks opened slightly lower on Wednesday, as the second U.S.-North Korean nuclear summit kicked off and tensions flared up between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62.38 points, or 0.24 per cent, at the open to 25,995.60.

The S&P 500 opened lower by 6.40 points, or 0.23 per cent, at 2,787.50. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.88 points, or 0.30 percent, to 7,526.42 at the opening bell.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump met in Hanoi, with the U.S. president saying he was not walking back on U.S. demands for North Korea’s denuclearisation.

Pakistan said on Wednesday it shot down two Indian fighter jets, a day after Indian warplanes struck inside Pakistan for the first time since a war in 1971, prompting several world powers to urge both sides to show restraint.

“Tension between India and Pakistan is weighing on markets this morning ahead of a very busy day of events,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

“We don’t expect (Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell’s second round of testimony before the U.S. House Financial Committee to change, thereby keeping the focus on geopolitical worries and the Trump-Kim summit that will likely lead to a mixed market session.”

Powell said on Tuesday that the Fed was in “no rush to make a judgment” about further changes to interest rates and that rising risks and recent soft data should not prevent solid growth for the U.S. economy this year.

The Fed’s dovish signals and optimism around China-U.S. trade talks have boosted equities in recent weeks, pushing the benchmark S&P 500 index to within roughly 5 percent of its record closing high hit in late September.

Among stocks, shares of Mylan NV sank 13.4 per cent after the generic drugmaker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast weak 2019 earnings, as it grappled with significant problems at its Morgantown, West Virginia plant.

In Asia, the Nikkei edged up 0.5 per cent, China’s Shanghai added 0.4 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slid 0.05 per cent.

Commodities

Oil rose for a second day on Wednesday, buoyed by an unexpected decline in U.S. crude inventories and after Saudi Arabia appeared undaunted by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on OPEC to prevent steeper price rises.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its partners were “taking it easy” in response to a tweet from Trump on Monday that called on the group to slacken its restrictions on crude production.

“We are taking it easy. The 25 countries are taking a very slow and measured approach. Just as the second half of last year proved, we are interested in market stability first and foremost,” Falih said in Riyadh when asked to comment on Trump’s tweet, CNBC reported.

The oil price has risen by almost a quarter so far this year, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, together with other producers such as Russia and Oman, agreed to cut output to avoid the build-up of a global surplus, particularly as U.S. output has boomed.

Brent crude futures were up 67 cents on the day at US$65.88 a barrel, while U.S. futures were up 75 cents at US$56.25 a barrel.

“Donald Trump tweeted and OPEC replied. It was not the message he wanted to hear so the story is not over yet,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.

Based on current market data, the so-called OPEC+ group is “likely to continue with the production cuts until the end of the year,” a Gulf OPEC source told Reuters on Tuesday.

Gold held steady on Wednesday, consolidating in a tight range, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish stance on monetary policy offering limited support, while palladium stayed above the key US$1,550 level and not far from its record high.

Spot gold was unchanged at US$1,327.62 per ounce, moving in a narrow range of around $4, while U.S. gold futures were flat at US$1,329.40.

“The Fed is clearly in a dovish mode, but it has been less potent than normal because the dollar hasn’t depreciated as much as it normally would have,” said Macquarie commodity strategist Matthew Turner.

“Gold is a bit like riding a bicycle, you have to keep going forward to stay balanced, there has to be some story to be up a bit, and right now, we don’t have that story.”

Gold has gained about 15 per cent from a more than one-and-half-year low touched in mid-August last year.

Providing a solid foundation for bullion was U.S. Fed chairman Jerome Powell’s reiteration that the central bank would remain “patient” while deciding the future of interest rates.

Meanwhile, spot palladium shed 0.2 per cent to US$1,556.67 per ounce, but held close to a record peak of US$1,565.09 scaled in the previous session.

Currencies and bonds

The Canadian dollar was up slightly at the 76.1 cent level as oil prices rose.

“Technically, with USD/CAD trading near the 200-day moving average at $1.3159 (75.99 cents US), the next key support level to watch is $1.3113 (76.26 cents US), which serves as the pivot for the uptrend in USD/CAD. Resistance stands at $1.3245 (75.5 cents US),” said Adam Cole, the chief currency strategist with RBC Europe Ltd.

The U.S. dollar hovered near a three-week low after shedding 0.4 per cent overnight on comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the central bank’s shift to a more “patient” policy approach.

The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.1 per cent at 95.928.

“As long as the Fed sticks to its neutral approach there is no monetary policy momentum which would allow EUR-USD to escape from the tedious sideways trade of the past months,” said Esther Maria Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to 2.634 per cent while the 10-year Canadian bond dipped to 1.864 per cent.

Stocks to watch

Torstar Corp. reported a loss in its latest quarter compared with a profit a year earlier as its revenue fell. The publisher of the Toronto Star newspaper reported a loss attributable to shareholders of $3.1-million or four cents per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31. That compared with a profit attributable to shareholders of $8.7-million or 11 cents per share in the same quarter a year earlier. Operating revenue totalled $144.9-million, down from $169.3-million. On an adjusted basis, Torstar says it earned a profit of 15 cents per share for the quarter, down from an adjusted profit of 32 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast $143.58-million in revenue and nine cents per share of earnings after adjustments, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

National Bank reported first-quarter net income of $552-million, up $2-million from the same period a year earlier. The Montreal-based lender’s earnings amounted to diluted earnings per share of $1.50 for the three-month period ended Jan. 31 , up from $1.46 a year ago. That’s lower than the $1.54 in diluted earnings per share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters Eikon.

Campbell Soup Co on Wednesday reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings, helped by its acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents a share in the second quarter ended Jan. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of 70 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Campbell’s shares jumped nearly 5 per cent in premarket trading.

Lowe’s swung to a loss in its fourth quarter, weighed down by sizeable one-time charges and a lethargic housing market. The home improvement company lost US$824 million, or $1.03 per share, for the period ended Feb. 1. That includes $1.6 billion in charges, most from a $952 million goodwill impairment charge. Stripping out the charges, earnings were 80 cents per share, a penny better than analysts polled by FactSet had expected. Revenue rose to $15.65 billion from $15.5 billion, short of Wall Street expectations. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 1.7 per cent, and 2.4 per cent in the U.S. This metric is a key gauge of a retailer’s health because it excludes results from stores recently opened or closed. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent in premarket trading.

Best Buy beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter same-store sales on Wednesday as the biggest U.S. consumer electronics retailer sold more wearable devices, gaming consoles and appliances during the holiday quarter. The company’s shares were up 10 per cent in early trading. Best Buy’s domestic comparable sales rose 3 per cent in the three months ended Feb. 2. Analysts on average had expected a 2.03 per cent rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue fell 3.7 percent to $14.80 billion, as the year-ago quarter had an extra week, but still beat expectations of $14.70 billion.

Weight Watchers shares fell 34.9 per cent in premarket trading, a day after the company said it hasn’t signed up as many subscribers as it hoped this winter and expects its profits to suffer. The New York-based weight-loss program operator says it now expects to earn between $1.25 and $1.50 a share this year. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $3.38 a share.

Chesapeake Energy Corp reported a 57 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, benefiting from higher natural gas prices. Its shares were up 5.7 per cent in premarket trading.

Shares of iconic Canadian retailer Hudson’s Bay Co., thanks to its shrinking share price, is now small enough to lose its spot on the S&P/TSX Composite Index next month when the index does a “reconstitution,” a process it does every quarter to remove companies that have become too small and add companies that have grown in value.

Will Rowan's son and Duke star freshman R.J., along with Canada's other top NCAA talent, be given the green light from their NBA teams two months after they're drafted?","TORONTO — With Canada's wealth of talent on the ice, hockey fans have enjoyed doing this for decades. They've scribbled their Olympic dream teams down on bar napkins over beers. They've filled up social media screens arguing about goaltending. They've tuned in to watch the dramatic unveiling of Canada's roster live.

Finally, Canada's men's basketball team has people talking. And not necessarily because of who's not playing, but because Canada Basketball will face a tough but enviable task of selecting its World Cup team — and if all goes well, it's Olympic roster for Tokyo in 2020 — from a deeper player pool than ever before.

When players gather for training camp in August ahead of the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China, it will arguably be the most talented collection of Canadians under one roof in history.

""It will be exciting for fans for sure,"" said Rowan Barrett, Canada Basketball's general manager of the men's team. ""Look at all the players, the players who are playing in the pros all around the world, and the ones who are coming along into the pros, the ones still in college.

""That's exciting, especially when you know you have the depth of players. It's definitely exciting for the game.""

The Canadians capped World Cup qualifying with routs of both Chile (85-46) and Venezuela (95-55) in St. John's, N.L., sewing up first place in Group F with a 10-2 record.

Canada used an incredible 36 different players through the 12 qualifying games that stretched over 14 months, finally booking its first World Cup spot in nine years with a victory in Brazil in December.

""It's important, right?"" Barrett said of Canada's final qualifying window in St. John's. ""Because we kind of built a culture. You're building a culture of winning. It's important every time you step on the floor. So it was great for the guys to be able to perform in that way, and to sacrifice the way they did, flying back here to play from their (pro) teams, especially from Europe, coming that distance, knowing the outcome is already determined.""

Canada's last World Cup appearance was a woeful, winless, first-round exit in 2010 in Turkey. Canada's only players with NBA experience were Joel Anthony and Andy Rautins.

Even the Canadian team that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics had just two NBA players in Steve Nash and Todd MacCulloch.

International basketball hasn't been kind to Canada's senior men's team recently. The women's team qualified for the past two Olympics, making it as far as the quarterfinals in both. And Canada captured its first world basketball title when the under-19 men's team won gold in 2017.

When Nash was named general manager of Canada's men's program in 2012, Barrett recalled the two-time NBA MVP telling him it might take six to eight years for Canada to climb up the global basketball ranks.

""Not that anybody was listening,"" Barrett said with a laugh. ""There was a euphoria and an excitement. But Steve did say it could take six to eight years to build up, because our players were so young.

""I think in 2015 when we put our team on the floor (for Olympic qualifying), our team on average was maybe 21 years old, our starting group, and that's generally not a recipe for winning basketball in FIBA. But they were some of the best players that we had, and they needed those experiences, so we went that way.""

Canada didn't qualify for the Rio Olympics, crumbling in the FIBA Americas qualifying tournament final against Venezuelan in Mexico. They travelled to the Phillipines for a last-chance qualifier, narrowly losing to France.

""Now those 21 and 22-years-olds are older, more experienced, more years of playing professionally, they have their games in hand, they're confident,"" Barrett said. ""So now with more experience in FIBA (international competition), and more players to draw on, and now that we're moving into 2019-2020, we should see greater success.""

The Canadian men's team will spend most of August together before the World Cup, Aug. 31 to Sept. 15 in China. How many players will be invited to camp is still to be determined. And while Canada had 14 players on NBA opening-night rosters this season, it's a good bet Canada's World Cup roster won't be an all-NBA lineup. It will be who fits where, with everything from international experience, chemistry, and a willingness to put aside ego, all factored in.

Other factors: Who'll be healthy? A couple of players are recovering from significant injuries. Who'll be available? Will Rowan's son and Duke star freshman R.J., along with Canada's other top NCAA talent, be given the green light from their NBA teams two months after they're drafted? Who'll commit to spending a good chunk of the summer with the program?

Here's a look at who Canada could have to draw from to build its 12-man roster this summer:

Guards: Cory Joseph (Indiana Pacers), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Los Angeles Clippers); Kevin Pangos (FC Barcelona); Jamal Murray (Denver Nuggets); Phil Scrubb (Zenit Saint Petersburg); Nik Stauskas (Cleveland Cavaliers).

While Joseph has the most NBA games under his belt, Gilgeous-Alexander has earned plenty of praise in his rookie season and Pangos brings a healthy dose of international experience. Murray is having a breakout season with Denver, while Scrubb is a versatile guard who's well-versed in the global game.

Forwards: R.J. Barrett (Duke Blue Devils); Melvin Ejim (BC UNICS); Andrew Wiggins (Minnesota Timberwolves); Dillon Brooks (Memphis Grizzlies); Dwight Powell (Dallas Mavericks).

Barrett is having an outstanding season with Duke, and more than held his own in his debut with the senior team last summer, while Ejim is a versatile forward and proverbial ""glue guy.""

Centres: Kelly Olynyk (Miami Heat); Tristan Thompson (Cleveland Cavaliers).

Canada is solid at centre with a couple of NBA mainstays.

Other players who coulkd get a look:

Trey Lyles (Denver); Chris Boucher (Toronto Raptors); Thomas Scrubb (Pallacanestro Varese); Aaron Best (Riesen Ludwigsburg), Joel Anthony (San Lorenzo), Nickeil Alexander-Walker (Virginia Tech), Brandon Clarke (Gonzaga), Anthony Bennett (Agua Caliente).",Canadian coaches face tough - but enviable - task of picking World Cup team,Estevan Mercury,https://www.estevanmercury.ca/canadian-coaches-face-tough-but-enviable-task-of-picking-world-cup-team-1.23650348

“In Canada, up to 2002, we were a very large player in the retail segment, both P&C and life. Since 2002, we have focused on the commercial segment,” said Saad Mered, CEO and chief agent of Zurich Canada on Monday.

“Over the medium to long term, clearly we have an interest in re-entering the retail segments, both P&C and life. How we do that is still to be defined, but clearly this is our ambition and we will work much more carefully over the next months and years to craft that strategy,” Mered added during a press briefing at Zurich Canada’s Toronto head office.

Zurich announced in late 2001 that it agreed to sell its Canadian personal lines business to ING. About 1,000 Zurich employees moved to ING as part of the deal that closed in 2002.

In 2009, ING Groep sold its interest in ING Insurance Company of Canada, which is now known as Intact Financial Corp.

“I think the Canadian market is a market that, institutionally, we know,” Mered said. “It’s a market of strong interest, but the days when you would do a classic retail model – which is a small broker-type auto and home business from scratch – those days are gone.”

Canadian Underwriter asked Mered whether Zurich’s vision is to write home and auto insurance Canada-wide.

“I think the retail segment is a very wide segment especially in the concept of innovation,” Mered replied. “Is Zurich interested, as a green field, to enter the auto and home market from scratch? No. Are we open to strategic opportunities? Absolutely. Are we open to other opportunities that could leverage a disruptive play? Possibly.”

Zurich ranked 10th in the Canadian liability insurance market in 2017, writing nearly $180 million in premiums in liability that year.

In the commercial market, Zurich Canada focusses mostly on large and upper middle market customers, Mered said Monday.

“In the short to medium term, we will be strengthening our commercial segments, especially in the middle markets, and continue to invest in our large account space as well,” said Mered.

The main focus of Monday’s briefing was on Zurich Canada’s plans to work with a Toronto IT vendor to have artificial intelligence software read policy documents automatically. That vendor, Chisel, placed first in Zurich’s recent Innovation World Championship, in which more than 400 technology startups from 49 countries competed.

Mered, former chief claims officer for Zurich Insurance Group, was appointed CEO of Zurich Canada in August 2018. He succeeded David Levinson, who replaced Patrick Lundy in 2016. Lundy had replaced Alister Campbell in 2012 as CEO of Zurich Canada.

“Part of the change in leadership teams that you are seeing at Zurich Canada is about re-positioning ourselves and pivoting to a situation where we can absolutely leverage those opportunities and gain adequate appropriate market share in our target segments,” Mered said of several Zurich Canada appointment announcements over the past year. Among them were the appointment of Mathias Sommer as head of operations for Zurich Canada.",This global carrier could re-enter the Canadian retail insurance market,Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/markets-coverages/this-global-carrier-could-re-enter-the-canadian-retail-insurance-market-1004160161/

An incident in which a man nuzzles and licks the ear of an on-air TV journalist reporting on a comedy event was roundly condemned on Wednesday, with some arguing the actions amounted to an assault.

In a widely seen clip, CBC’s Chris Glover is talking back to the studio when one man leans into the frame behind him and mugs in front of the camera before leaving while a second man, dressed in a green Saskatchewan Roughriders hoodie, moves in on the reporter.

The man, identified by multiple viewers as comic actor Boyd Banks who has appeared on CBC shows, proceeds to demonstratively lick Glover’s ear and kisses his neck while the journalist continues speaking, before throwing it back to the studio with the line:

“Things are getting a little awkward out here, so I’m going to pass it back to you,” Glover said.

“Yeah, that’s a little strange. It’s really unnecessary,” host Dwight Drummond told Glover. “Just move away from that gentleman.”

Neither Glover nor Drummond responded to a request for comment. However, a spokesman for CBC denounced the man’s actions and praised the reporter.

This is so disturbing and I get more uncomfortable every time I watch this creepy guy assault @chrisgloverCBC on live television.

It’s gotta stop! @chrisgloverCBC @CBCToronto #Toronto #reporter pic.twitter.com/rSeTStQI5L — Jeffrey Vallis (@jeffrey_vallis) February 27, 2019

“Chris Glover showed remarkable composure and professionalism in the face of a very awkward situation,” Chuck Thompson said. “Unfortunately, the trend of harassing reporters continues and is something we take very seriously.”

Thompson called the incident “troubling as they are unacceptable.” He did not say what, if anything, the broadcaster planned to do about the situation. Toronto police said they had no record of a complaint.

Saskatchewan-born Banks, who has multiple film and TV credits including the CBC’s “Little Mosque on the Prairie,” could not be immediately reached for comment.

In recent years, female reporters in particular have been the subject of crude, harassing catcalls which, in some cases, have resulted in charges against the perpetrator. More recently, other journalists have been physically assaulted while doing their jobs in public.

The 40-second clip of Glover sparked outrage on social media, with some condemning what happened as an assault, and others saying they would not have remained so calm.

“This is disgusting,” CBC reporter Lorenda Reddekopp tweeted. “I also can’t believe none of the bystanders did anything.”

“This is so disturbing and I get more uncomfortable every time I watch,” said Toronto-based writer Jeffrey Vallis on Twitter. “Why do people think it’s OK to harass and assault reporters while they do their job?”

Thompson said the particular assignment was viewed as “low risk” but noted situations can be unpredictable. Regardless, Thompson called the incident troubling.

“This type of harassment is completely unacceptable from any individual,” he said.

Timbits hockey player too cute to handle

Scroll to continue with content Ad

If you haven’t seen the viral video of a four-year-old hockey player wearing a microphone while practicing, you’re in for a treat. Mason Rupke’s on-ice escapades have taken the internet by storm, and for good reason.

Since his father, Jeremy, posted the video of Mason’s shenanigans to YouTube last Friday, it’s been viewed more than five million times.

While this youngster learns the basics of the sport with his Timbits minor hockey team, the microphone picks up his commentary and the results are hilarious.

“I’m gonna have a nap,” he states at one point while lying on his back following a tumble.

“Maybe after hockey I’m gonna go to BaDonalds (McDonalds),” he explains to one of his instructors later.

“Whoa, you’re fast,” he says while being carried by an instructor to a shooting drill.

No matter what type of day you’re having, the video is sure to bring a smile to your face. And that is exactly what its creator says he wanted.

“Having Mason bring so much joy to so many people, that’s definitely what I intended,” the father told Global News after the footage went viral. “I think the video overall has been a huge success.”

Most importantly, the little hockey player wants the world to know he’s a force to be reckoned with on the ice.

“I shoot them in the net and score up the top,” the four-year-old Ontario boy told Global News.

Opposing coach calls on fans to salute NBA icon

Dirk Nowitzki, a man widely regarded as the greatest European to ever play in the NBA, is likely in the final season of his illustrious career that has spanned 21 seasons. During that time, the 40-year-old German has only worn Dallas Mavericks colours.

Nowitzki is a 14-time NBA All-Star, plus a former NBA champion and NBA Finals MVP. What might be most impressive about his career is how he helped trail-blaze the growth of basketball beyond North America. For all he’s done for the sport, he’s been celebrated this year, and the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers was no exception.

A former NBA champion himself, Doc Rivers wanted to make sure Nowitzki got the send-off that he deserved in what might have been his final NBA game Monday in Los Angeles. With less than 10 seconds left in the game, Rivers called a timeout, grabbed the public address announcer’s microphone and urged fans at the game to applaud Nowitzki.

“Dirk Nowitzki!” Rivers called out to the crowd. “Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go! One of the greatest of all time! Dirk Nowitzki!”

Those in attendance responded with an ovation that lasted about a minute and visibly moved the seven-foot forward, who gestured his appreciation to Rivers and the Staples Center crowd.

Following the game, Nowitzki took to Twitter to thank Rivers for his kind gesture.

“Thanks Doc and Clippers fans! I will always remember this,” he wrote.

NHL rookie turns demotion into ‘classy move’

The business side of hockey made it difficult for 2016 first round pick Trent Frederic to stay with the Boston Bruins after 11 games in the NHL.

A few trades and some contract situations forced the Bruins to send the 21-year-old rookie on a two-way contract back to their AHL affiliate last Friday.

The pill was especially tough to swallow for the young forward considering Boston was scheduled to play the Blues in St. Louis, his hometown, the very next day. To make matters worse, he had purchased a suite at the rink for his friends and family to watch his first NHL game in the city that he grew up in.

Instead of letting the box go to waste, he gave it to the St. Louis Blues Special Hockey, a non-profit organization for developmentally challenged youth and adults, according to their Facebook page.

The Blues tweeted about the “classy move” and went on to beat the Bruins 2-1 in a shootout.

Raptors fans give DeRozan a hero’s welcome

In the short history of the Toronto Raptors, fans have never seen a star as committed to the city as DeMar DeRozan. Unlike former dinos Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter and Chris Bosh before him, DeRozan was an All-Star calibre player that never wanted to leave Toronto.

DeRozan was traded with Jakob Poeltl to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green last summer. In his first game back with the Raptors last Friday, the California native received a hero’s welcome when he returned for the first time with his new team.

It was an emotional night. The eruption from the crowd following his video tribute has been called the loudest for a former Raptor in franchise history. DeRozan appeared to be moved by the kindness from fans.

With all that he did in his nine seasons on the squad, should we have expected anything less?

WWE star announces his cancer is in remission

While the world of professional wrestling is some times lamented for being scripted and fake, WWE superstar Roman Reigns’ situation is as real as it gets.

Reigns, whose real name is Leati Joseph Anoai, has been a warrior inside and outside of the ring for more than a decade. The former WWE Universal champion was only 22 when he was first diagnosed with leukemia.

After his cancer returned last October, Reigns was forced to step away from the WWE. During Monday Night Raw, Reigns revealed the news many people had been hoping for.

“I’m in remission, y’all,” Reigns said to a loud applause.

“That overwhelming support that you gave me, it gave me strength, it gave me new life,” Reigns added. “Thank you.”

A division of the Belgian-based group DEME and Canada’s DeepGreen have begun testing a nodule collector called Patania II designed to collect minerals from the ocean floor.

The groups are conducting trials to try and find an alternative to deep-sea mining as the practice is unaffordable, environmentally hazardous, and the potential subject of new UN regulations. Unlike deep-sea mining, nodules can be collected with minimal disturbance to the marine environment and contain minerals including nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, and cobalt.

DEME’s Global Sea Mineral Resources and DeepGreen are running the Patania II — named after the world’s fastest caterpillar — in part of the Clarion Clipperton Zone which spans 4.5 million square kilometres between Hawaii and Mexico.

Patania II will literally crawl along the ocean floor collecting nodules, while a third trial planned for 2023 will bring collected nodules to the surface.

Shipping giant Maersk has also gotten involved with the project and is providing vessels for DeepGreen’s research voyages in the Clarion Clipperton Zone.

While China holds the most deep-sea exploration licenses and is typically seen as leading the charge in this field, Global Sea Mineral Resources believes it’s winning the technological race given its decades of experience dredging the ocean floor and building offshore wind farms.

In Canada

To help Canada’s automotive industry find success going forward, the federal government needs to support the development of electric vehicles and fuel-efficient gas vehicles, a report produced by the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives suggests.

The report, released Tuesday, suggests that while automotive companies may be attracted to Canada because of the plethora of skilled labour, that alone is not enough. “A high-skill labour strategy only works if we have cars to build,” wrote Charlotte Yates and John Holmes, adding that this means focusing on electric vehicles because that is where the market is going.

While electric vehicles currently account for less than two per cent of the market share in North America, Yates suggests the current market share isn’t what is most important. “You don’t build it for five or 10 years … yes, you look at current demand, but you also look at where the market is going,” Yates explained, pointing to GM’s recent decision to pull out of Oshawa as it shifts focus to electric vehicle research and production.

The study calls for Ottawa to create financial incentives for companies producing green vehicles as well as tax credits for small tech companies, the Toronto Star reports.

Internationally

Mining company Rio Tinto has promised record returns for its shareholders, announcing Wednesday that “annual capital returns would be $13.5 billion for 2018, including a final dividend valued at $3.1 billion and a special dividend amounting to $4 billion.”

The pledge for record returns is reinforced by 56 per cent hike in Rio Tinto’s annual net profit.

The world’s second-biggest miner by market value joins a parade of mining companies delivering value to their shareholders as they “reap the benefits of asset sales and strong balance sheets,” the Wall Street Journal reports.

Source: Peter Epstein for Streetwise Reports (2/28/19)

Paul Cowley, CEO of First Vanadium, speaks with Peter Epstein of Epstein Research about the vanadium market and his company's plan to fast-track its flagship project in Nevada.



First Vanadium Corp. (FVAN:TSX.V; FVANF:OTCQB) is one of the better known vanadium companies. Its CEO, Paul Cowley, can be seen in a number of video clips that I linked to at the bottom of the page. Despite being a blue chip name, First Vanadium's market cap is just US$19.5 million. This, for a company that claims to have the highest-grade primary vanadium project in North America, and a plan to fast-track its flagship project in Nevada. To top it all off, management just released a summary of its maiden mineral resource estimate.

The maiden mineral resource estimate came in at 303 million Indicated pounds of V 2 O 5 (vanadium pentoxide) @ 0.615% & 75 million Inferred pounds of V 2 O 5 @ 0.52%. That represents a moderate increase in size and grade from the historical resource estimate of 289 million Inferred pounds of V 2 O 5 @ 0.515%. Importantly, 80% of the new resource (in pounds of V 2 O 5 ) is in the Indicated category. At the current vanadium pentoxide price of US$17.60/lb., the in-situ value of First Vanadium's 303 million Indicated pounds of V 2 O 5 alone = US$ 5.33 billion. That's about 275x its market cap. Note: in-situ values can be misleading for early-stage projects, but they can be compared to peers at similar stage.

Is vanadium for real? Will Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries cause demand and prices of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) to soar? Will global infrastructure projects demand greatly increased amounts of vanadium-strengthened steel rebar? Please continue reading for answers to these and many other important questions.

Note: Peter Epstein and Epstein Research have no prior or existing relationship with CEO Paul Cowley or First Vanadium.

Please give readers the latest snapshot of First Vanadium.

First Vanadium Corp. is focused on vanadium and its advanced-stage Carlin Vanadium project located in Nevada, the largest and highest grade primary vanadium deposit in North America. The company is run by professional geologists and engineers who have worked for major mining companies in senior positions in exploration, deposit discovery, construction and mining operations.

The company has a tight share structure and is well funded. We just released a maiden mineral resource estimate that's 80% in the Indicated category, and that's larger than our historical resource, which was all Inferred. We are very pleased with these results.

Why vanadium? Why not lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel or copper?

All of these minerals are going to be winners in the near future with the inevitable rapid demand increases for these metals with the commercialization of lithium-ion electric batteries in automobiles and vanadium redox flow batteries in large power storage applications. There is just not enough production of these minerals from existing mines to meet the projected demand of this exciting evolution in battery technology and commercialization.

In addition, in the case of vanadium, it is chiefly used as an alloy for strengthening steel in infrastructure: rebar, pipelines, airplanes and car frames. CIBC Mellon has estimated that there will be $35 trillion dollars of global infrastructure projects starting over the next 20 years, which will spark big demand for vanadium.

Tell us more about the Carlin Vanadium project.

The Carlin Vanadium project is a black shale-hosted sedimentary bed of high-grade vanadium, which is shallow dipping and near-surface, making it ideal for open pit mining. The project's superior location and infrastructure are added benefits, being located less than 6 miles by road to a major rail hub, a major highway, power and mining community.

Furthermore, the grades are higher, about double that of other Nevada-based vanadium projects, and there's significantly more vanadium metal in our deposit, also about double that of our peers. Our maiden mineral resource estimate shows the large scale and high grade of the deposit.

How significant has First Vanadium's exploration drilling been compared to historical drilling? How many new holes were drilled?

The two drill campaigns that First Vanadium did in 2018 totaling 89 holes were extremely strategic and successful in both in-filling and expanding the deposit. We frequently received assay values with higher grades than those found in the older drill data. This is reflected in our maiden mineral resource estimate that shows a 0.615% V 2 O 5 grade in the Indicated category alone. The infill drilling improved the confidence level to justify a high percentage of the resource being in the Indicated category.

Please explain First Vanadium's fast-track approach at the Carlin project.

In the 15 months we have had the project, we quickly received permits to drill, conducted two drill campaigns, made significant inroads in metallurgy, conducted environmental studies, and delivered a significant maiden mineral resource estimate, with 80% of the vanadium in the Indicated category, all to advance the project and unlock value for shareholders. These steps are the normal steps taken by companies to advance and de-risk projects, but normally it would take three to four years to accomplish what we have done in 15 months.

Is there too much talk about VRBs, which only represent 1%2% of vanadium use? Is the VRB opportunity possibly overrated?

The Vanadium Redox Flow Battery has only just started to be commercialized over the last two years and currently draws a small percentage of global vanadium consumption. It will ramp up in the short and intermediate time frame to become a much more significant part of vanadium consumption. For example, one project alone in China, the Dalian project, is expected to consume 7,000 tonnes of vanadium, ~8% of annual production, the equivalent of powering 100,000 homes. You can see that the scaling opportunity is eye-opening.

The VRB battery is a superior battery for storing large amounts of electricity and they are forecast to last 25 years, whereas the equivalent lithium-ion battery needs to be replaced every three to five years due to its depleting characteristics. The VRB battery is the ideal battery solution for the green energy space for large-capacity electricity storage in power grids and in wind and solar applications. Some have stated that if vanadium prices are too high, the VRB battery will not be competitive, but continuing technical advancements are being made to bring costs down. Some vanadium producers are offering to lease the vanadium in the battery to reduce costs to the end user.

What do you make of the sharp decline in vanadium prices in Q4 2018?

Vanadium was the best performing metal in 2018, despite the pull back at the end of the year. September and October 2018 saw a rapid increase in vanadium prices leading up to the implementation of the announced November 1, 2018, Chinese law requiring 30% more vanadium in Chinese rebar. Rapid price increases are normally followed by pullbacks as a normal reactionary correction, but eventually that pullback overreaction needed to stabilize and reflect more prevailing supply and demand factors.

Naturally, the reason for the run-up in price is real and is expected to add more demand to the stage. The strong demand for the metal, and the tight supply, are still the normforcing prices up. From mid-January to late-February, the Chinese price of vanadium pentoxide is up 12.8% from US$15.60 to US$17.60/lb. (See chart below from vanadiumprice.com). We expect 2019 will be another strong year for vanadium prices.

What's the biggest risk to the Carlin project in the next 12 months?

Perceptions. In the valuations of vanadium projects and their in-situ assets, and in vanadium price performance and trajectory through 2019 to provide the investor with confidence and interest in the future of this metal.

Thank you, Paul, that was very helpful, I think that readers should have a much better understanding of First Vanadium Corp. (TSX-V: FVAN) / (OTCQB: FVANF) after reading this interview. Congratulations on your maiden mineral resource estimate, and continued good luck on fast-tracking the Carlin vanadium project.

Canada and Mexico are dealing with lingering hard feelings over last summer’s surprise Mexican trade deal with the United States as their new continental trade pact awaits a final stamp of political approval.

Two weeks ago, the head of a visiting delegation of Canadian parliamentarians told the newly installed Mexican foreign minister his country threw Canada “under the bus” last August when it forged a bilateral trade deal with the United States during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A top Mexican trade official tells The Canadian Press that while there may have been a misunderstanding, the U.S. side deal was the work of the previous Mexican government, and Canada and Mexico’s new leaders are moving forward constructively.

The side deal between the U.S. and Mexico appeared to blindside the Trudeau government, forcing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to abort a three-country trip to Europe.

Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country’s three leaders – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.

The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.

Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.

Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.

The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada’s dissatisfaction about last August’s Mexican side deal with the country’s new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization’s Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

“We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,” Nault said in an interview.

Nault said he was concerned about “the way it unfolded at the end,” and a perception “that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico.” He said that represented a break from “what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn’t overtake us.”

The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.

“I think it’s getting better,” Nault said this week of the relationship. “Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.”

Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico’s deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.

“That was part of the negotiation process … right now, it’s over,” de la Mora said in an interview.

“The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.”

The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.

De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico’s top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.

Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn’t begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country’s lawmakers.

During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador’s team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.

“We were not involved in that decision at all,” de la Mora said.

“If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.”

She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.

“We promised we would make Ontario open for business and open for jobs. Promise made, promise kept,” he said, pointing to the 41,000 full-time jobs created in the province last month, extending an era of near-record low unemployment that dates back to former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals in 2017. But the premier emphasized Wednesday night at the Toronto Congress Centre that difficult decisions loom as the Tories tackle a $13.5-billion budget deficit. “We continue to fight hard for Ontario workers and Ontario jobs, for the hard working people in private-sector unions. Everything the government of Ontario does is put at risk when you do what the Liberals did and let deficits spiral out of control,” he said in a speech that was live-streamed on the Progressive Conservative Party’s website.

Ford noted the event was sold out, suggesting the party could have taken in as much as $4 million before expenses. “This is the largest fundraiser in Canadian history,” the premier boasted. Because of the large crowd, the snowstorm and some protesters outside, attendees were slow entering the sprawling Etobicoke venue, which delayed Ford’s speech by about an hour. At Queen’s Park earlier in the day, he defended the closed-door dinner and emphasized he also does events that ordinary Ontarians can afford to attend. “I’m going up to Muskoka on Friday for a $25 spaghetti dinner to talk to the real people. I encourage everyone to come out Friday to listen to the great things that this government has done for the common folk,” Ford said in the legislature.

But Green Leader Mike Schreiner said those folksy fundraisers aren’t the problem. “We haven’t heard any reports that the premier is pressing corporate lobbyists to sell $25 tickets to his spaghetti dinners,” said Schreiner.

Last Thursday, the Star disclosed that the Tories asked lobbyists to help sell tickets because campaign finance reforms that banned corporate and union contributions have made it a challenge to fill tables. “It’s potentially doing an end run around the ban on corporate donations,” Schreiner said. While premiers’ major fundraisers have traditionally been open to the media, the party announced Tuesday that the event would be closed. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said that is becoming a theme for Ford’s administration. “It says that the government is elected for only special interests,” said Horwath. “We know that this government, particularly, does a lot of their business behind closed doors in secret where nobody knows what they’re doing and what they’re cooking up.” Government house leader Todd Smith said prohibiting reporters was “a decision made by the party.” But Tory sources, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal PC matters, insisted the edict came from Ford’s office.

The store in Shanghai — the first of a planned 1,500 — has hockey sticks for door handles and abundant maple leaves, on cups and dusted on the tops of lattes.

Our brand has an essence and a spirit. And that’s been around and survived 60 years Tim Hortons President Alex Macedo

“I’m not the political expert,” Tim Hortons President Alex Macedo said Tuesday. “We can’t judge when or how or where this is going to end…. If we can provide good service and a good restaurant environment, then that’s the best we can do.”

When Macedo talks about the China expansion, he’s fond of repeating some version of this phrase: “We try to focus on what we can control.”

And he cannot control what happens with Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive who was arrested in Vancouver late last year at the behest of U.S. authorities, an act that infuriated Beijing and set off a diplomatic spat between Canada and China.

What Macedo can control, though, is how much Tim Hortons reveals about its Canadian roots to Chinese consumers.

But he wasn’t willing to tamper with the brand’s two main pillars: Canada and hockey.

“Our brand has an essence and a spirit,” he said. “And that’s been around and survived 60 years.”

“When we tested the brand and our products, people were fine. I don’t know. We didn’t test anything political, I don’t think. We had, you know, two-hour wait lines today in the restaurant. People were wrapping around the block. So I think it was a good day.”

The China expansion is out of the Restaurant Brands International Inc. playbook.

RBI, which owns Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, expanded Burger King in China by signing a master franchise agreement with the private equity firm Cartesian Capital Group — essentially designating a single franchisee to build out the market.

Cartesian builds and runs the restaurants, with the option to sub-franchise them. By using the same strategy — and the same private equity firm — with Tim Hortons in China, Macedo was confident the company will surpass its goal of opening 1,500 locations in 10 years, political tensions or not.

We didn’t test anything political

But there is a legitimate risk to businesses connected to countries that have ran afoul of the Chinese government, said William Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. who served as under secretary of commerce for export administration under U.S. President Bill Clinton.

“The Chinese have gotten very good over the years at playing the nationalist card,” Reinsch said, referencing a boycott of South Korean brands and businesses in China starting in 2016 after the Chinese government voiced its displeasure with South Korea’s purchase of an American missile-defence system.

“If the Chinese government is annoyed and feels that it has unfairly dealt with, then it will respond by telling its people that the Chinese people have been hurt.”

It’s not yet clear whether the Huawei episode will reach that level, he said, though news of a spike in Chinese imports of Canadian soy beans in January could be interpreted as an encouraging sign for Canadian brands in China.

Despite the risks, Reinsch said he didn’t think the expansion was ill-advised.

“They’re not the only coffee-doughnut place in China,” he said. “One of the things you have to do is distinguish yourself from the rest of them. And one of the most obvious things that Tim Hortons can do is to basically say they’re not American.”

On Wednesday, however, Canada might have done it. While the testimony of Donald Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, transfixed the world, the reports originating out of an entirely different committee meeting in Ottawa may have been more scandalous.

Canada has always presented a good front of house: prim, stoic, orderly and well-managed. The kitchen is ankle-deep in grime and in dire need of pest control, but the backroom is easy to hide from happy patrons.

The scandal now unfolding in Ottawa – concerning just how far Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government was willing to go to save iconic Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin – is giving us all a peek behind that grubby little counter. It’s showing us what this country really is and for whom it actually runs.

According to Jody Wilson-Raybould – who confirmed the reporting by The Globe and Mail – the former justice minister and attorney-general “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion ... in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,"" she said in dramatic, hours-long testimony in front of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights on Wednesday. A DPA would allow the company to forgo a criminal trial for bribery for projects in Libya in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing and a fine.

Crass partisan electoral gain seemed to be at least the undertone of these conversations, she said. Occasionally it was even an overtone: One PMO staffer noted that SNC-Lavalin was threatening to move its headquarters from Montreal to a more congenial location abroad ahead of the federal election this fall, allegedly saying that “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.”

She said she felt that pressure over a number of months until the end of 2018, when Ms. Wilson-Raybould was suddenly demoted and replaced in her high-profile cabinet post by a member of Parliament from Montreal.

Mr. Trudeau delivered a brief statement on Wednesday night in Montreal, disagreeing with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We of course had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions,” he said.

No doubt, that focus will be welcome in some corners. But it should be noted that Mr. Trudeau is not the great defender of Canadian jobs, writ large, here.

He’s defending certain jobs. Not jobs in Oshawa, or northern Alberta, or Newfoundland – no, no, how quaint. Mr. Trudeau is passionate about the jobs that give lustre to a company that stands at the very firmament of the central Canadian elite, headquartered in a province with enormous psychological and electoral significance for the Liberals.

SNC-Lavalin provides the right sort of jobs, being the kind of company that knows the right sort of people: that is, the kind who can make a call that gets answered at the PMO.

One of these meetings about SNC-Lavalin took place with Mr. Trudeau himself, according to Ms. Wilson-Raybould: “At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec ... 'and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” She says she responded: “Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision, as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.”

“No, no, no,"" he allegedly said – ""we just need to find a solution.”

And all this, to save what? A company that has been mired in corruption scandals, both domestic and international, for decades. The World Bank Group blacklisted SNC-Lavalin and more than 100 of its affiliates for 10 years, meaning that Canadian businesses now dominate the bank’s list of companies sanctioned for fraud or corruption.

Now, a report from La Presse alleges that SNC-Lavalin paid tens of thousands of dollars for the services of prostitutes and naked dancers to entertain the son of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi during a tour of Canada in 2008.

Even Liberal die-hards aren’t really trying to defend this. The only recourse is this anemic plea for jobs, or to assure themselves that the Conservatives would be worse, probably.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s not hard to detect the nihilistic shrug behind all of this, though. This is the way it’s done – the way things have always been done. That’s how the country really runs. This is who it is run for.

Once you assure yourselves that the Other Guys would probably do the same, you’ve handed the Liberals, the “natural governing party of Canada,” the license to get away with anything.

And then they get away with everything.

Even though Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony didn’t involve porn-star hush-money or a convicted felon hurling broadsides at the sitting U.S. president, that revelation might just shock you even more.

THE CANADIAN PRESS

The ongoing controversy regarding the prosecution of Canadian engineering company SNC-Lavalin raises fundamental questions about how decisions to prosecute are made and what role elected politicians should have in that process.

The scandal has resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, amid allegations the

Prime Minister’s Office pressured its former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to resolve criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin by a deferred prosecution agreement.

My research investigates how accountability, transparency and control of prosecutorial discretion can be structured, an interest inspired by my work as a former prosecutor in British Columbia. In relation to political control over individual decisions, my findings suggest that the risks of partisan political influence on the process are significant.

In Canada, even if there is sufficient evidence to proceed, prosecution must be in the public interest. This test is highly discretionary and depends on the facts of the case.

Looking at publicly available policies from jurisdictions throughout England, Canada and Australia, I found three categories of factors that influence the decision to prosecute: the seriousness of the offence, the expected results of the prosecution (the sentence, for example) and the effects of the prosecution itself (harm to a vulnerable victim, for example).

Assessing the impact

The decision may involve issues of broad public policy or specialized government knowledge, such as an impact on foreign relations or, in the SNC-Lavalin case, the effects of prosecuting a large company that employs thousands of people.

The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized it would be unconstitutional for the partisan interests of a political party to determine who is or isn’t prosecuted for an alleged crime.

The dangers of partisan political influence is that, simply put, the allies of a political party may be shielded from prosecution and their enemies may be subject to it.

This risk materialized in Canada most notoriously in 1964 during what was known as the Rivard affair.

Lucien Rivard faced extradition to the United States on charges of drug trafficking. Senior ministerial officials in Lester B.

Pearson’s government pressured counsel for the U.S. to agree to Rivard’s release on bail, including an offered bribe of $20,000. The attorney general of Canada, Guy Favreau, resigned following an inquiry that criticized his decision not to prosecute any of the officials involved.

The Shawcross Doctrine

By their nature, decisions on whether to proceed with a prosecution involve allegations that are not tested in court, nor is the full record available for public review. So how can the public be confident that partisan political interests do not affect the decision?

The Shawcross Doctrine is a statement in the House of Lords in

1951 by Hartley Shawcross, the attorney general of England at the time. It asserts that the decision to prosecute is that of the attorney general alone.

The doctrine recognizes, however, that the process of determining if a prosecution is in the public interest cannot always be made by the prosecutor in isolation. But Shawcross emphasized that the attorney general should control that process:

“In order to inform himself, he may, although I do not think he is obliged to, consult with any of his colleagues in the government… the assistance of his colleagues is confined to informing him of particular considerations which might affect his own decision, and does not consist and must not consist, in telling him what the decision ought to be. The responsibility for the eventual decision rests upon the Attorney-General, and he is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter.’’

The Shawcross Doctrine has been widely accepted throughout English common-law countries. However, it cannot be compared to law, either legislation or case law. Rather, it’s a description of the understandings and practice that a constitutional convention flows from.

There are differences between the position of England’s attorney general in the 1950s and in Canada today. That includes the Canadian attorney general’s position in the cabinet and the introduction of a federal Director of Public Prosecutions, whose office handles most prosecutorial decisions. But the attorney general retains the power to issue directions.

Prosecution & politics: What’s the practice?

Surprisingly few cases explore the intersection between politics and prosecution.

Notable exceptions include the Campbell affair of 1924 (which may have contributed to the fall of England’s labour government), the

1977 resignation of Australian attorney general Bob Ellicott (who cited attempts by the government to control his discretion) and the

2007 termination of an investigation into the conduct of BAE Systems Plc, a weapons manufacturer, by the U.K.`s Serious Fraud Office on the grounds that proceeding could damage the country’s national security interests.

Each of these cases has been studied by scholars (see the work of professors John Edwards and Philip Stenning in particular) for what they can tell us about practice at a particular time and place. But the list of cases that reach the public in full detail is a short one.

The controversy surrounding the SNC-Lavalin prosecution is in its early days and hopefully more information will emerge.

But scrutiny of the relationship between politics and prosecution is critical because practice, not doctrines, is the foundation of prosecutorial independence from partisan politics. With that independence rests the integrity of the entire justice system.

By Derek Baker, February 27 2019 —

Canadian governments are plagued by strict party discipline and leader-dominated election campaigns. Backbenchers rarely vote out of party lines. When they’re allowed to, it’s apparently a big deal — ‘the party will allow this to be a free/conscious vote’ plasters headlines whenever it occurs.

Likewise, the provincial level is also riddled with strict party discipline and leadership domination. Last November, Robyn Luff, a member of the legislative assembly from the New Democratic Party, was kicked out of caucus after releasing a letter decrying the party’s leadership prohibiting MLAs from stepping out of line. In Luff’s Nov. 5 letter, she claimed that “when Ministers and MLA’s (sic) come into the house to vote they will say ‘what are we voting for? Are we for or against this?’ They have no idea what we’ve been talking about in the house- all they need to know is what they are being told to do.”

The Official Opposition doesn’t look any better. Trampling over a constituency’s nomination process, UCP leader Jason Kenney recently appointed Len Rhodes for the Edmonton-Meadows riding. During the vote for Bill 9: Protecting Choice for Women Accessing Health Care Act, every single UCP MLA abstained from voting during a walkout. You can’t claim that all 26 UCP MLAs independently came to the decision to walk out on the vote.

Restricting the ability of MLAs and MPs to vote as they please is highly problematic for a first-past-the-post electoral system. What’s the point of electing representatives for your riding if they’re just a voiceless rubber stamp for whatever a party’s leadership wants?

Sure, backbenchers would still likely vote along party lines if they weren’t whipped, but it’s a persistent problem in Canadian politics from a representation standpoint.

That’s why I was initially excited when the UCP proposed their democratic reform policy on Feb. 14. Among several policy points, one was to allow “free votes for MLAs on everything not deemed a confidence vote, or a key platform commitment.”

On the surface, this policy looks like it promotes the representative abilities of MLAs. But MLAs have always had the power to vote freely. The policy acknowledges that their MLAs already are restricted in their ability to do so. Also, what votes will count as a “key platform commitment?” Again, this will be left to the party’s leadership to decide, promoting leader-dominated politics.

Showing that the policy is nothing more than a façade to promote the independent decision-making ability of MLAs is the contradiction of the next policy point: “Stopping floor crossing by requiring that MLAs resign and seek a byelection before they can change parties.”

It’s understandable why the UCP would want to prohibit floor crossing. Since 2010, the only MLAs to cross the floor came from conservative provincial parties — 10 from the Wildrose and four from the Progressive Conservatives. We wouldn’t want to have an exodus of UCP MLAs leaving if they’re fed up with Kenney’s leadership, would we?

But strange is the party’s claim that since electing the NDP government, Albertans are frustrated that they’ve been “betraying voters’ trust with floor crossings.” Discounting the floor crossings resulting from former PC and Wildrose MLAs joining the UCP following the merger, the only MLA to formally cross the floor to join another party since 2015 is Sandra Jansen, from the PCs to the NDP.

MLAs should be permitted to cross the floor as they see fit. It’s the ultimate confirmation of their independence as legislators, rather than just being another whipped partisan cog in a leader-dominated machine.

Yes, constituents often base their vote on the party or leader rather than the actual local candidate. This is true in Canada as it is in other countries that use district-based electoral systems. Look south of the border and you’ll find Republican voters in Nevada still rather elect a dead brothel owner than his Democrat opponent. I’d bet a rock could run as a candidate in some Alberta ridings and still win.

If you’re unhappy that your MLA crossed the floor, it’s your prerogative to not vote for them again. But that shouldn’t inhibit an MLA from crossing the floor if they believe it would make them a better representative for their riding.

It’s time for strict party discipline to end. It further contributes to the unhealthy polarization of politics. This election season, ask candidates when they come to your door how they see themselves representing the riding itself rather than just toeing party lines. Ask them their opinion on their party’s leader. Eliminating party discipline will take more than a policy that only provides lip service by saying, ‘Okay, we’ll allow free votes — but not on every issue and you still need to be loyal to your party above all else.’",Party discipline just as much a problem in Alberta politics,thegauntlet.ca,http://www.thegauntlet.ca/party-discipline-just-as-much-a-problem-in-alberta-politics/

A lot has changed since this time last year. Scott Moe had only been premier for about a month and the NDP leadership vote that made Ryan Meili party leader, had not happened yet.

Now, both leaders are well established in their positions and getting their parties ready for the 2020 election campaign.

The October 2020 vote may still be about a year-and-a-half away, but Leader Post political columnist Murray Mandryk expects that election to cast a long shadow.

“It’s absolutely that gear up to the election time when, if nothing else, they have to start practicing for that particular bout,” Mandryk said.

“There are some pretty severe and steep differences between the NDP and the Sask. Party right now, and we’re not seeing ponied up arguments – we’re seeing passionate debates from both sides on their issues.”

READ MORE: Sask. equivalency agreement on extending coal power likely pushed back

A divisive issue expected to be part of Question Period debates, the Brandt/Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) building in Regina’s Wascana Park.

A CBC investigation uncovered that the $1 lease at the now demolished CNIB building will carry-over to the four-storey, Brandt owed facility to be built in the park. The CNIB will be a tenant in the Brandt property.

“Certain people seem to be getting special treatment and special considerations just to allow this structure to go forward. I think this story now has traction and legs it didn’t before,” Mandryk said.

“It’s got the smell of something where an opposition should really be able to make hay with this stuff,” University of Regina political science department head Jim Farney said.

“It’s not enough for an opposition party to say there’s something wrong here, but everything else is ok. It’s there’s something wrong here and we can deliver something better. For me the NDP question, this session, is can they do that?”

The Budget

The biggest day on the legislative calendar is March 20, budget day. Finance Minister Donna Harpauer expects to deliver a balanced budget, wiping out a $348 million deficit and fulfilling a three-year promise to return to balance.

Past budgets have included increased and expanded sales taxes plus spending cuts to get out of a then over billion-dollar deficit.

However, the government coffers have been aided by larger-than-expected non-renewable resource revenue and a one-time pension adjustment last year.

“The question is, are they back to a structural balance? Have they gotten back to a structural balance?” Farney said. “Have they gotten back to where they said they needed to be without any of those one-year only sorts of things?”

READ MORE: Sask. government approves $194M in new spending ahead of budget

Farney is also curious to see how the public sector is funded, following the province’s unsuccessful plan to reduce compensation by 3.5 per cent as a cost-saving effort.

“They really can’t raise taxes anymore, they really can’t be in a position to keep cutting things because that’s not going to put them in good stead going into an election year next year,” Mandryk said.

Both Fanrey and Mandryk don’t expect major spending announcements in the 2019/20 budget, speculating the Saskatchewan Party government will save that until their pre-election budget next year.

Legislation expected to pass

Once the budget is delivered, it will shape much of the legislative agenda going forward.

Pieces of legislation introduced in the fall are expected to pass, especially with a strong Sask. Party majority.

This includes changes to the Trespass Act, making it so people seeking access to rural land need to get the owner’s permission first. Currently, it is the responsibility of rural land owners to put up fences, post their land, or have “no trespassing” signs.

This legislation has faced criticism from hunting groups like the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation, saying it is becoming increasingly difficult to track down rural land owners.

READ MORE: Sask. organization concerned trespassing change will impact wildlife population controls

The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations has also discussed a legal challenge, saying these changes violate treaty rights.

Justice Minister Don Morgan has said that treaty rights around hunting will not be affected on Crown land, but those rights do not extend to private property.

Assuming it passes, Saskatchewan will be the first Canadian jurisdiction to adopt the British Clare’s Law. This would allow people to ask police to reveal charges related to domestic abuse for an intimate partner.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial ...","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing scrutiny after former Justice Minister and member of parliament Jody Wilson-Raybould publicly accused him of trying a squash a corruption and fraud investigation into an influential Canadian construction company.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin, The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons' Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec's pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec's current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October's federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she ""experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion"" over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Read more:P eople are fleeing the US to seek asylum in Canada, and the pause they take before crossing the border illegally is powerful

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau's cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs' department amid the fallout of the scandal.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,"" Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould's testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that ""a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.""

While Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau's approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

The Lead

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says he is trying to pursuade President Donald Trump that tariff rate quotas (TRQ) on Canadian and Mexican steel imports will be just as effective as plain tariffs, reports Reuters.

He made the comments during an appearance before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee hearing. Perdue was asked about the American steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products levelled in response.

“The president, we’re working hard to persuade him that the steel industry here, which is concerned, can be protected through a TRQ program here rather than tariffs and release the retaliatory tariffs,” he told the committee.

TRQs allow a certain amount of product to enter the country duty free, but anything above that total is subjected to tariffs. South Korea agreed to a tariff rate quota for 70 per cent of its steel exports to the U.S. in 2017.

Perdue said he has been advocating for the removal of tariffs on steel products from Canada and Mexico since all three Northern American countries signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement last year.

“The expectation was that the agreement would be signed and the tariffs would come off and that hasn’t happened but it’s in the best interest of all three countries to do the that,” he said.

In Canada

Dairy industry representatives are calling for federal support because of concessions made in recent trade deals, specifically the pan-Pacific trade pact, known as the CPTPP, the CETA deal with the European Union and USMCA agreement with Mexico and the United States, reports Farms.com.

Canada will lose 8.4 per cent of its domestic market share and $450 million in annual revenue to foreign dairy products because of these trade deals, and combined with pre-existing imports approved by the WTO, about 18 per cent of Canada’s dairy market will be filled by foreign products in five years, warned David Wiens, vice-president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada.

“These agreements will inhibit not only the sector’s ability to grow but also to maintain current market share,” he told the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry on Tuesday.

“This is eroding dairy farmers’ confidence in the future of our sector, particularly for our young farmers and lenders who have invested in assuming market growth.”

Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay is visiting Nova Scotia on Thursday, where he was to officially open a new research winery at the Kentville Research and Development Centre. It’s aimed at helping local grape growers and vintners “hone their production techniques to take full advantage of the province’s unique soils and growing conditions,” according to Agriculture and Agri-food Canada.

Around Town

Well, the talk of the town remains Jody Wilson-Raybould’s much anticipated testimony to the House justice committee, which certainly lived up to expectations, at least from a purely newsworthy perspective.

In her heavily hyped address, she accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior figures in the Trudeau government of conducting a “concerted” effort to politically interfere in the handling of the SNC-Lavalin case by the Public Prosecution Service. Wilson-Raybould, though, argued that there was no criminal wrongdoing in the matter, because she wouldn’t permit any political influence.

After her appearance, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau should resign, while Trudeau said he disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and refused to step down. On Thursday, Trudeau said he still needs to think about Wilson-Raybould’s future in the Liberal caucus. Charlie Pinkerton has this story.

The House Agriculture committee met earlier today to hear from representatives of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association and the National Farm Animal Care Council for its study on the “perception of and public trust in the Canadian agricultural sector.” It then went in-camera to discuss drafting instructions for a report on its study on support of Indigenous Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food industry and later address unspecified committee business.

The Senate Agriculture committee met earlier in the day as well to hear from the CEO of Nova Scotia cannabis producer Aqualitas for its study on how the value-added food sector can be more competitive in global markets. It also considered a draft report for its look on issues relating to agriculture and forestry generally.

The Canadian Federation of Agriculture‘s annual general meeting comes to a close today. Here’s the agenda for the conference that’s being held in Ottawa.

Internationally

Back to the U.S., struggling Wisconsin dairy farmers could flip their allegiances away from Trump in the 2020 election, reports Fortune.

Amidt the president’s trade wars, Wisconsin dairy farms are closing at what the news outlet called an unprecedented rate, with 700 shutting down just last year, or two daily.

While the state’s declining dairy sector largely backed Trump and allowed the Republican to flip Wisconsin from the Democrats in 2016, it could turn away from the president as tariffs on U.S. agriculture products rock the industry. Milk prices in the country are flirting with their lowest level in the last 50 years, according to reporting by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel cited by Fortune.

ICE canola futures dropped to fresh contract lows during the week ending Wednesday and there could be more losses on the horizon.

“Unfortunately the technicals and fundamentals are tremendously bearish,” said analyst Wayne Palmer of Exceed Grain Marketing, adding “fresh contract lows breed fresh contract lows.”

Without a deal between China and the U.S. to end their trade spate, Palmer expects the trend to drop lower in soybeans, “which would weigh on canola as well,” reports Glacier FarmMedia News.

Trudeau must be very calm right now, because Liberals are nervous in the wake of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s remarkable revelations about her dealings with Trudeau and top members of his government. “It’s probably cost us the election,” one usually upbeat MP said offhandedly when asked what damage had been done by the testimony. Another MP, doing his own soundings of colleagues since Wednesday, said about one-third of the caucus is “grumbling” about Wilson-Raybould, another one-third is keeping an open mind about both sides and the last third is hoping that this episode is a corrective slap in the face for business as it has been practised in this government for the past three years. “Heads should roll,” said an MP who would put himself in that last category. Which heads? “Maybe all of them.”

The immediate Liberal communications strategy seems to revolve around having heavy-hitter cabinet ministers, such as Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, talk to the media about how they continue to stand behind the PM. But there does not seem to be a plan to assure MPs or Liberals at large about their election prospects, apart from having Trudeau in business-as-usual mode. Trudeau himself has indeed radiated icy, almost surreal calm in media encounters after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony — even when technical glitches erupted in the midst of attempts to connect the PM with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, currently orbiting above the Earth in the International Space Station.

Article Continued Below

Yes, that really was on the prime minister’s agenda on a significant, day-after-disaster itinerary — a golden opportunity for would-be political comedians, who got to tell all kinds of jokes about who else should be hurtled into the stratosphere right now as Trudeau’s PMO is still reeling here on Earth with Wilson-Raybould’s detailed condemnations. (Insert your favourite Trudeau adviser here.) Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould may have a lot in common in times of stress. The former attorney-general sat stone-faced and calm in her front-row seat on the government benches in the Commons on Thursday as the opposition howled outrage on her behalf. It was an odd spectacle in a week filled with things we haven’t seen much around Parliament Hill.

Wilson-Raybould now has superhero powers in the eyes of the Conservatives and New Democrats, even as she continues to be a leading Liberal. She can leap tall government buildings and make herself invisible when she chooses, as she did on Thursday. Her most staunch defenders in the chamber were not the people surrounding her, but the Conservatives and New Democrats across the floor, voicing fury on her behalf at reports of how one of her own Liberal colleagues called her grievances “sour grapes.” The colleague in question is Jati Sidhu, from the B.C. riding of Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon. In an interview with the Abbotsford News, Sidhu also said: “The way she’s acting, I think she couldn’t handle the stress…. I think there’s somebody else behind — maybe her father — pulling the strings.” Sidhu has since apologized, but it’s safe to say that the exasperation under his remarks is not isolated to just one MP or loyal Liberal soldier. Caucus management has never been a strong suit within Trudeau’s government; some backbenchers complain that members of the media have more regular access to the top folks in the PMO than they do.

Wilson-Raybould’s extraordinary intervention has emboldened some Liberals to declare their own dissatisfaction with PMO-MP relations — and make no mistake, Conservatives and New Democrats have picked up on those threads of dissent too, which means they’ll keep using disclosures this week to drive wedges in Liberal unity. But any clamping down on that dissent by the current PMO could backfire. What Canadians witnessed on Wednesday at a Commons committee could be seen as the direct result of keeping resentment and frustration simmering too long on the back burner. Steely calm is the opposite to nervousness, but it may not be always the best antidote for nerves. Susan Delacourt is the Star’s Ottawa bureau chief and a columnist covering national politics.

On February 20, 2019, Ontario Premier Doug Ford suspended MPP Randy Hillier from his Tory caucus. This was in response to his behaviour while answering questions from parents of children with autism at Queen’s Park regarding changes to Ontario’s Autism Plan (OAP), which he ended by saying “yada yada yada.” Following his suspension, and an apology to the parents by Ford for Hillier’s behaviour, Hillier tried to explain he directed the phrase towards NDP MPP Monique Taylor, who he accused of taking advantage of these parents. But it doesn’t change how dismissive and offensive it came across to the parents.

Something this informal amidst such a serious issue is nothing short of embarrassing and disappointing to see in a Canadian government when handling concerned Canadian parents. The changes to the OAP to spread funding to more families, but many parents are concerned because they seems unlikely to solve the problems with the past OAP, namely decreasing the waitlist for families to receive financial assistance to seek effective therapy for their children. Those parents at Queen’s Park that day had valid and serious concern for the care of their family, and deserved a little more formality than “yada yada yada.”

This isn’t to say politicians need to be exclusively robotic and official, but it shouldn’t be this difficult to read the room. In America, senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has gained a lot of popularity for having a more blunt and approachable tone in her political career, recently even starting a serious speech in Congress about political corruption with “let’s play a game.”

The difference between her and Hillier is that Hillier didn’t take caution or consideration with how he was speaking, to ensure it was a space where something would be welcome and fine to use less formal tone and language. Instead, by using a phrase like “yada yada yada” to concerned parents, he belittles a serious issue in a way that someone with political authority and power should rarely — if ever — be doing.",Political Corner: Doug Ford’s suspended MPP is disappointing and embarrassing to have happen in a Canadian government,The Peak,https://the-peak.ca/2019/02/political-corner-doug-fords-suspended-mpp-is-disappointing-and-embarrassing-to-have-happen-in-a-canadian-government/

Members of the business community as well as community leaders met for the annual Industry Luncheon hosted by the Dufferin Board of Trade, The Home Builders Association, and the Rotary Club of Orangeville.

The Luncheon was held at the Best Western in Orangeville on Thursday, February 21.

“This is a networking and business event to connect business leaders and political leaders in Dufferin County with the keynote speaker and with each other, so they have an opportunity to network and mingle and to also hear the inspirational keynote speaker,” explained Dufferin Board of Trade general manager, Diana Morris.

The Board of Trade serves to connect businesses in the region.

“We are the local connector of small businesses,” Ms. Morris said. “We connect small businesses with each other, with the resources that they need, and we advocate on behalf of those needs.”

Each year the luncheon features a keynote speaker of note.

“Last year we had Steve Paikin from TVO’s The Agenda, that was an awesome event. We’ve had Doug Ford before. In 2016 we had someone who had climbed Mount Everest, so every year we have someone who has an interesting story and someone who offers inspiration. We’ve had quite few high profile speakers over the years. Luckily enough, through our connection with RBC, who is our sponsor, they are the ones who the Olympians, so that was an excellent theme for us this year.”

This year the keynote speaker was Canadian Olympian, Korey Jarvis.

Jarvis has participated in the Commonwealth Games, Pan American Games, the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016, and is a national champion.

As keynote speaker, Jarvis told his story of being encourage to try wrestling by a friend. He spoke of the dedication he has given to his sport, and of his eventual return after taking time off from competing.

The annual luncheon has been going on for around 25 years and has a wide variety of sponsors.

The Home Builders Association in particular has wide reaching connections because of the nature of a business that connects with the trades, lumber suppliers, cement suppliers, furnace and air condition contractors and the many different businesses that contribute to the industry.

In attendance were many local business people, political leaders, and leaders of different organizations from the region.

Many Albertans have received unsolicited text messages or phone calls in recent weeks from political parties and special interest groups gauging support ahead of the impending, but yet to be called, provincial election.

Text messages including ‘Do you support Rachel Notley fighting for pipeline jobs?’ or ‘Can the UCP count on your support?’ have become commonplace on the phones of voters.

According to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), there are currently no rules against phoning or texting potential voters as long as the caller is not attempting to make a sale. Attempting to secure a vote is not considered to be a violation of the guidelines.

A list of landline or cellular numbers of voters can be easily secured by organizations through voter lists or public databases.

Its multi-stakeholder process is now one of the reasons ICANN should play a big role in fighting cyber crime, says a Canadian who has served on the agency’s working groups.

Elliot Noss, CEO of Toronto-based domain name registrar Tucows Inc, make that pitch during his keynote address at the first conference of the Canadian Internet Governance Forum.

“I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to know who the criminals are and be able to do nothing about it,” he said. Right now “cyber security is an exercise to managing the damage. There is no downside to being on the other [criminal] side.”

One of the biggest problems is there are no international agreements to fight cyber crime, he said. Yet law enforcement officers often attend ICANN meetings.

ICANN co-ordinates the maintenance and procedures of databases controlling the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet. Until October, 2016 it was officially under the wing of the U.S. commerce department. Since then, however, it has been independent.

Noss praised ICANN’s “multi-stakeholder experiment,”, comparing it to other international agencies where governments sit in control and other groups watch from the sidelines.

Adding fighting cyber crime to ICANN’s responsibilities would be a natural extension of its multi-stakeholder framework, he argued, because law enforcement officials already attend some of its meetings.

“The two saddest parts of [cyber crime] are the asymmetry,” Noss said. “The difference between attacking and defending is ridiculous.” The other problem is there are no international agreements on fighting cyber crime. Yet nation states are represented on ICANN.

In an interview he also noted many police forces, including the RCMP, the FBI, Interpol, as well as civil society attend ICANN meetings, so a cyber body could be a working group. Perhaps it would then spin out on its own.

In a follow-up interview Noss wanted to make clear he isn’t suggesting ICANN change its mandate. His point is that people who are interested in cybercrime could leverage the fact that they already meet at ICANN sessions.

However, in he was also cautious about the possibility, noting police are “inherently national and paranoid,” he said, which goes against a multi-stakeholder solution.

He also noted that nation-state participation in ICANN is still tentative. The government advisory committee now meets openly and members participate as peers with three other international advisory committees, he said. “This is in no way settled,” he admitted. “It is still being contested,” he admits, “but the evolution over 20 years is remarkable.”

The Internet Governance Forum is a multi-stakeholder policy advisory unit of the United Nations. It cannot adopt resolutions. It exists to facilitate discussion between governments, intergovernmental organizations, private companies, the technical community and civil society organizations that deal with or are interested in Internet.

Wednesday’s conference of the Canadian IGF, attended by academics, government officials and members of the IT community, held sessions on disinformation, cyber security challenges for business, improving the security of IoT devices, privacy, inequality on the Internet and Canada’s role in Internet governance.

A Canadian journalist warned a panel on disinformation that people here shouldn’t think that fake news on social media networks only comes from other countries.

“A lot of this (misinformation) is locally driven.” said David Skok, editor in chief of The Logic. “Just as we had negative campaign advertising on TV, we now have campaigns drive wedge issues around immigration because it is such a reactive issue that is dividing the populace.

“Don’t be fooled into thinking this is only foreign actors. Your local politicians and campaign staff and crisis communications firms are doing this more than foreign actors are.”

“There are lots of examples of domestic actors inciting, creating discourse and divisiveness through the platforms that could do far more damage than a Russian bot or Macedonian bot could do.”

Kevin Chan, Facebook Canada’s director of public policy, said company has made many efforts to fight disinformation since it allegations that Russia made great efforts through social media to disrupt the 2016 U.S. federal election. In the last two quarters alone it removed 1.5 billion fake accounts worldwide. On the other hand, he admitted that on any given day as many as four per cent of accounts are fake.

He also said Facebook Canada hasn’t yet seen the kind of social media manipulation seen in the U.S. 2016 election campaign.

Facebook is working with Canadian political parties to ensure they have contacts to alert his company if they see worrisome content on the platform, Chan said.

“I don’t think our work will ever be done, it is a security issue” and bad actors will always evolve their tactics. “But we feel increasingly good about our posture.”

Anatoliy Gruzd, who holds the Canada Research Chair in social media data stewardship at Ryerson University’s business school, said 94 per cent Canadians on the Internet have at least one social media account, “so the potential for exposure to disinformation is huge.”

He’s also been watching the political situation with China, but doesn’t know if that could affect agriculture. “At the moment, it doesn’t seem to be affecting on ...","[UPDATED Feb. 26, 2019] Some producers are responding to the market while planning their spring planting decisions. Others are going with tried-and-true rotations. But everyone is watching the weather and geopolitical events.

“From a pulse perspective, things have improved a lot since the fall of 2017, when India closed its markets. Prices have risen some, but not a lot,” said D’arcy Hilgartner, former chair of the Alberta Pulse Growers Commission.

He said the market signs are encouraging and some growers are putting peas back into their rotation. In southern Alberta, lentil prices have rebounded a bit.

“They’ve come up from the lows they were from 2017 and 2018. Depending on people’s rotations, it can be a viable option.”

Brennan Turner, CEO of FarmLead, said lentil prices depend on India.

“You’re not going to see import tariffs relax until September, maybe October or November,” he said.

This is due to the federal election coming in India. Nothing will change in terms of trade or tariffs before the election, said Turner. The Indian government will see if there are good monsoon rains from June to September.

“If they don’t get their monsoon rains, they won’t see as many pulses planted and that will impact production,” said Turner, who is based in Foam Lake, Sask. Producers likely won’t see anything done about the tariffs and trade with India until October-December 2019, and that’s if India gets the monsoon rains. If it doesn’t, tariffs could be relaxed a little sooner.

China is interested in Canadian peas, but it started buying them later in the year, because Russia and Kazakhstan harvest starts about a month and a half before the western Canadian harvest.

“The challenge is that harvest that you see in Western Canada for pea prices gets elongated into the second half of Q4, which is frustrating. If you’re thinking of locking in peas, try to get between 30-40 per cent sold, and if you’re willing to take on an act of God clause, you can get to 50 per cent sold. We know there will be a lot of peas planted in a lot of places,” he said.

India is still importing some peas despite the tariffs.

Hilgartner said he uses a relatively set rotation each year on his farm near Camrose. Pulses are a significant part of his rotation. He will be trying new crops, and expanding into fababeans a little bit, because he sees opportunity.

“We’re trying some soybeans on our farm. It’s more to learn how to grow them and see if they are a future option for us.”

Geopolitical risks

Jonathon Driedger, senior market analyst with FarmLink Solutions in Winnipeg, said that most of his farmer clients are comfortable with the level of weather uncertainty going into spring, as that’s just a feature of agriculture.

“What adds more uncertainty to the bigger picture than we’ve seen in a long time is that there’s more geopolitical and regulatory risk. I think that is something that has been building over the last couple of years. I don’t think that is something that is going to go away very quickly,” he said.

He mentioned the U.S./China trade disputes, and how the dispute between them is impacting Canada.

“We’ve also got this thing with Huawei and even though they’re not targeting Canadian canola, some of our canola seems to be tied up with stuff like that,” he said.

All of this creates an element of greater uncertainty, and makes it more difficult for analysts to try and figure out what is going to happen, he said.

Dave Bishop, the new chair of the Alberta Barley Commission, farms near Barons. He’s concerned with the weather in his area.

“Down in the south, for three years parts of it have been pretty dry,” he said.

He’s also been watching the political situation with China, but doesn’t know if that could affect agriculture.

“At the moment, it doesn’t seem to be affecting on the barley side anyway. I’m hearing rumblings that canola could be affected. There’s always going to be a geopolitical issue that we don’t know about that could hit us,” said Bishop.

He thinks barley acreage could go up, and Turner doesn’t disagree.

“We’ve had record exports for the second straight year in barley out of Canadian ports. That’s a strong factor,” he said.

There are strong feed prices for barley, and there will probably be a lot more feed barley exported, since Australia is not as able to compete in this market as much because of its drought.

Gary Stanford, the new chair of the Alberta Wheat Commission, makes his decisions based on crop rotation. The Magrath-area farmer is watching very closely to see how trade issues are shaping up with the United States, since he is so close to Montana. He’s planning to cut back on his durum acres since the price is down, but hopes Canada can strike a deal with Italy to lower its tariffs.

*Turner said he would not be surprised to see wheat prices pick up a bit. He advised farmers to do their contracting before the end of June for delivery at harvest time.

“There are opportunities right now for the Canadian wheat market, specifically the exports being bigger,” said Turner. There are signs that it could be a record year of exports, with good prices. But strong prices will not likely last long.

“CPS has surprised everyone. I have to give praise to some of the crop organizations that have been going to Africa and Latin America and opening up doors to this lower-protein wheat that we are producing in Canada. I think that’s going to continue to support the market. We’re seeing record levels,” Turner said.

There’s a strong Canadian-authored bent to this month’s picks with six of the titles — Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 written by authors from this country.

Interestingly, this month the list is dominated by a wide range of non-fiction titles: History (No. 1), Cooking (3), Autobiography and Biography (Nos. 5 and 7), Science (No. 8) and Political Science (No. 10)

And those titles that were fiction fell exclusively into the Thriller (Nos. 4 and 6), or Mystery and Detective (No. 9) categories — even in the one “fiction” title Autopsy of a Boring Wife, (No. 2) tension was key.

As to comments, about My Lovely Wife, Jennifer Green of Oshawa Public Library says: “In short, this book is crazy. It reminded me a bit of Gone Girl and The Dinner (by Koch) in that this title made me feel very uncomfortable reading it. There are some great twists, and the characters are just off the wall. It was a quick read and one I want to recommend if you’d like to get out of your comfort zone.”

He stresses ...,"OTTAWA — After seven years representing Victoria in Parliament as a New Democrat, Murray Rankin says he won't run for re-election this fall.

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the ""most rewarding experience"" of his life.

""I've got to know so many people in our community,"" he said. ""I've got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I've really enjoyed that.""

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP's prospects or Jagmeet Singh's leadership.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats' fortunes are ""definitely going up,"" adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by ""significant margins"" over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

""It looks to me to be a turning point,"" he said. ""We will have a leader in the House ... I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.""

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October's election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec's Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.'s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver's mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he's done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

""I hope I've made a difference,"" Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the ""constitutional crisis"" involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

Prior to becoming a politician, Rankin worked as a law professor and practising lawyer with expertise in public and environmental law.

It was February 18. Family Day. He was at the airport in Cairo waiting for a flight home after almost two months away for work.

After checking in his luggage, Yasser told his family he was ""put on the side"" by airport staff and was still waiting for his passport. He later let them know he was going to miss his flight. Then he told them he loved them.

""That was the last direct communication we had with him,"" his daughter Amal Albaz told HuffPost Canada.

Yasser sent one more message to a friend, explaining that he was being taken away by state security.

Albaz said she immediately reported the case to Canada's emergency consular services line. She later learned her father was being subjected to ""general questioning"" but was allowed to have a lawyer present.

""The lawyer himself is very shocked,"" she said. ""He said this makes absolutely no sense. He has no idea why this is happening as well.""

For almost one week, the family had no idea where Yasser was. Then the nightmare began.

It feels like a nightmare that we're not waking up from. Amal Ahmed Albaz on her father's detention in Egypt

The lawyer told them Yasser has not been charged with anything but that he was being detained and taken to Egypt's Tora prison complex, a notorious facility often used to detain political prisoners. It's the same place where Muslim Brotherhood supporters were held after the Egyptian military overthrew Mohamed Morsi — a senior figure in the organization and the country's first elected president — back in 2013. Many who are suspected of or charged with terrorism are also held there.

""It all feels so very surreal, but at the same time it feels like a nightmare that we're not waking up from,"" Albaz said.

Tora prison has been criticized by human rights advocates for its treatment of prisoners. Its reputation has become so grim that its maximum security wing has been nicknamed the ""scorpion.""

According to a 2016 report from Human Rights Watch, inmates in that part of the complex aren't given any beds or mattresses, sleeping on ""concrete platforms"" instead. They don't receive any hygienic items and are often denied medical care and visits by family members, friends and lawyers.

On Wednesday, Albaz said in a statement that Canadian officials have located her father, who is in a ""state of shock.""

""He has been sick for several days and the embassy has provided him with medication. He is forced to sleep on the concrete floor during Egypt's winter, without a blanket or even a pillow. When family members tried providing these basic necessities to the prison, they were denied,"" she wrote.

Courtesy Amal Ahmed Albaz Oakville, Ont.-based engineer Yasser Ahmed Albaz, pictured with his daughter Maryam, has not been able to contact his family since February 18.

Albaz said her father, an Oakville, Ont.-based engineer who regularly travels for work, regularly enters and leaves Egypt with no hassle. The family was there last summer for her sister's engagement party.

""It's still very unclear why they're holding him,"" Albaz said. ""The only thing we can think of is this is a huge mistake. There's definitely a huge misunderstanding. My father is not politically active, he has no political affiliations. Anything that could be kind of a trigger simply isn't there.""

While Albaz and her family have no idea what kind of conditions their father is being held in, Tarek Loubani says he can ""virtually guarantee"" what the experience looks like.

Watch: Tarek Loubani and John Greyson detail their torture at Tora prison:

The emergency physician at the London Health Sciences Centre knows first-hand of the horrific conditions at Tora prison. He was detained there for almost seven weeks along with fellow Canadian, filmmaker John Greyson in 2013.

Loubani and Greyson were in Cairo on their way to Gaza to produce a film. But while they were in the Egyptian capital, the deadly Rab'a protests broke out. Hundreds were killed in a brutal crackdown on demonstrators.

Loubani said he tried to tend to some of the wounded while Greyson filmed what was happening, but the two were later accused of killing a police officer, assisting the Muslim Brotherhood, carrying explosives and even simultaneously being informants for Hamas, the CIA and the Mossad.

""When I hear that nobody's been allowed to see Yasser for a week, I can virtually guarantee you I know exactly what happened there, because that's what happened with us, that's what happened before us, that's what happened after us,"" he told HuffPost.

They wanted us there, boiling alive.

Loubani said on the first day of his detention he and other inmates were made to wait in a van in the scorching mid-August heat.

""They wanted us there, boiling alive.""

He said when the van's doors opened, two teams of police officers holding clubs were outside.

Loubani said everyone got hit.

Those who could run away fastest got hit less. Anyone who fell while fleeing got hit the most.

Before entering the prison, Loubani said they were all made to wait in a room. The guards asked for the ""Canadian"" — Greyson.

Loubani said his colleague tried to say he is Canadian, hoping it would protect him somehow. It didn't. The two were severely beaten, Loubani said.

""There was snot coming out of my nose, there was blood coming down. I was sweating. I was yelling. It was a terrible experience.""

The Canadian Press Friends, family and colleagues of Tarek Loubani gather at a rally in Victoria Park in London, Ont. on Sept. 24, 2013, calling on the former Conservative government to become more involved in negotiating the release of Loubani and John Greyson.

There have also been reports of inmates at Tora being denied medical care. Khaled Al-Qazzaz, a Canadian resident who served as an adviser to Morsi, was placed in the prison for almost two years. He suffered spinal injuries while there and was only allowed access to a hospital after a year, according to the Toronto Star.

""The sanitary conditions were terrible and I had skin and stomach problems. My health was deteriorating,"" Al-Qazzaz told paper in 2016.

A 'Kafkaesque, brutal system'

Loubani said he and Greyson were allowed to be examined by a doctor after almost a week in Tora only because they were Canadian citizens.

""Nobody else got that. Nobody was allowed out of the cell for two weeks.""

The doctor documented that Loubani had broken ribs and noted he was concussed, that he was ""pissing blood."" Greyson, Loubani said, was beaten so badly that he could almost make out a number ""6"" on his back from one of the guard's boots.

""When we left, we left 50 days in, nobody had yet been charged,"" Loubani said, adding that the time they spent in Tora was an ""investigation period,"" which is how authorities justified not laying any charges.

He said this was a pivotal time for Canadian authorities to intervene and secure their release.

""That's why it was so key for us to get out before we were charged, because if we were charged then you're part of this kind of Kafkaesque, brutal system. There's not much that you can really do to interrupt it.""

Albaz echoed that concern. She said although Canadian authorities in Egypt are working to track down and visit her father, she wants more from the federal government at home.

Asked if Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland or Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were intervening in the case, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada only told HuffPost the government is aware of a Canadian detained in Egypt and noted that it was providing consular services.

""I'm not hearing any signals of urgency or escalations to the minister or higher, which is something that we need urgently,"" Albaz said.

""I need my father out of prison and on a plane back home. Only [Freeland] can do that.""

Loubani said the federal government needs to apply political pressure and make it clear that there will be ""consequences"" if Yasser is not given his basic human rights. He said the former Conservative government took this type of approach when he was detained.

He said he understands how much Albaz's family is suffering, and he can certainly understand what her father could be going through. But most of all, he hurts knowing that Yasser's case is not unique.

""You know what the worst thing about it is? This is happening to thousands of Egyptians,"" he said.

""And I know that we can't change that or stop that, but we can in this one case, and we have to in this one case.""

Albaz said more than 3,000 emails have been sent to Freeland and other MPs urging the government to escalate its response and secure Yasser's release. Loubani said that type of collective pressure on the government is crucial.

""We got out of because of the work of thousands of Canadians who made phone calls, who wrote letters and who signed petitions,"" Loubani said.

""Sometimes it feels as though those efforts are in vain, but I'm free. And [Greyson] is free. And that would have never happened without every single person who signed, who called, who fought, who asked, who demanded. Not only is it a way, it's probably the only way that this man comes home safely to his family.""","Federal Government Must Escalate Case Of Yasser Ahmed Albaz, Canadian Held In Notorious Tora Prison: Ex-Prisoner",HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/26/yasser-ahmed-albaz-tarek-loubani_a_23677580/

New Justice Minister David Lametti came to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Wednesday to hesitantly discuss C-58, the government’s weak access to information legislation. At the same time, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was giving forceful testimony at the House of Commons Justice Committee.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was aimed at disclosing the political interference she believes she faced from senior officials trying to get her to change the public prosecutor’s stance on pursuing a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. Lametti’s testimony was aimed at getting Bill C-58, which includes measures for greater secrecy, passed into law.

Wilson-Raybould came with an order-in-council partly waiving cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege; Lametti came with talking points in which he primarily said he was not the responsible minister for access to information.

Lametti admitted he had not looked at the prime minister’s mandate letter about his new role, including on information disclosure, though he assumed it was the very same letter Wilson-Raybould received and had taken to heart. So much for the value some ministers place on the mandate letters they receive.

David Lametti admitted he had not looked at the prime minister’s mandate letter about his new role, including on information disclosure.

The main questioning Lametti faced was why C-58 permitted the disclosure of so much “sensitive” information on individual judges’ expenses. Lametti tried to assure the senators that the government would consider amendments to Bill C-58 that would mean only supplying aggregate data on judges’ expenses – a compromise and setback for disclosure.

But when it came to the question of whether Bill C-58 would ban the use of “code names” by the Department of National Defence to hide information (an issue that has arisen in the trial of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman), he could not offer an opinion or state that his government would close this gap in public disclosure. Conservative Sen. Denise Batters held up three blacked-out access-to-information records, asking how Bill C-58 would change such secrecy; again, no real response from Lametti.

When it came time to answer if he would consider having a “duty to document” for public servants built into Bill C-58, Lametti could not respond. The issue here is officials avoiding the access to information act’s disclosure provisions by not putting in writing everything that is being dealt with.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was documenting some of the unrecorded oral exchanges she had with senior officials in ministers’ offices, with the PMO, with the PCO Clerk and with the prime minister.

So we had one prepared former minister, who detailed her past interactions, and one new minister who could not in his testimony even document the boundaries that solicitor-client secrecy should have.

While the public focus overwhelmingly this week was on former minister Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony, what was passed over was the new justice minister offering nothing to improve the most regressive features found in Bill C-58.

No one thought of bringing up for disclosure what briefing notes or marching orders Lametti might have had on the SNC-Lavalin file. Only casually mentioned was that Bill C-58 permanently excludes prime ministerial and ministers’ records from any future access to information coverage.

Senators have started to give clause-by-clause consideration to Bill C-58, but with few prospects that its worst features will be removed or improved.

When Wilson Raybould was justice minister, she also had little to say on Bill C-58, preferring at the time to leave government messaging to then-Treasury Board president Scott Brison. But she sure had something to say about the secret manoeuvring she faced on the SNC-Lavalin file.

Opposition parties are calling for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign or face a public inquiry after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. No resignation calls after Lametti’s weak performance, or probes demanded into how Bill C-58 adds to the government’s secrecy tools and creates “pro-active” propaganda opportunities.

Both the government, and SNC- Lavalin, appear able to survive and will continue to thrive behind closed doors.

The biggest one, Taybeh, struck me more as the Molson Canadian of the West Bank, a mediocre and popular light beer. Shepherds’ stuff is seriously good by ...","My Israeli uncle was driving us to the Rishon LeZion bus station, where my wife and I would board a bus to Jerusalem en route to Ramallah in the West Bank, when he finally addressed our impending trip into Arab territory.

“I do not recommend it,” he flatly stated, staring ahead at the road. “At all.”

The response is common among Israelis, who haven’t been allowed in major Palestinian-controlled cities since 2000. But my wife and I weren’t interested in the politics of the place – we just wanted to see it. As an editor at The CJN, I felt I had some implied obligation, an unspoken urge to meet some of the people caught in the middle of a conflict that we, as Canadian Jews, so often talk about.

Our base was a guesthouse run by the Khouriya family in Jifna, seven kilometres north of Ramallah. Theirs is a Christian home, guarded by a tall gate and three wooden crucifixes on the kitchen table.

Rawda, the matriarch, was preparing a tagine when we arrived, chopping skinned potatoes into a large plastic bowl. The domestic life is relatively new for her. She used to travel the world as a social worker, speaking at conferences for the rights of women and the disabled. The work would exhaust any mother, but as a Palestinian, she needed to jump through added bureaucratic hoops to secure exit papers and account for extra travel days, flying in and out of Amman’s airport.

Issa, her husband, was getting older, and his years as a construction contractor began taking their toll. In 2009, the Khouriyas agreed to open their house as a B&B.

Their goal is more cultural than political, less about converting guests to pro-Palestinian advocacy than chatting over pots of fresh sage tea. When I told them I wanted to write an apolitical travel story, Issa chuckled. “I think everywhere you go, they will talk politics, because this is our life.”

He nonetheless suggested we visit Rawabi, the West Bank’s new, eerily dystopian skeleton of a yet-unfinished, purpose-built city. It’s unlike anywhere else in the West Bank: tall tan highrises shoot up in geometric circles like a mirage in the desert, delivering pristine views to a potential population of 40,000.

I say potential because, right now, only around 3,000 people live there. That hasn’t stopped the outdoor shopping mall, packed with high-end brands including Swarovski and Steve Madden, from hiring cashiers to occupy mostly vacant stores and cleaners to mop floors and wash windows. It is a hopeful capitalist enterprise rooted in fervent optimism.

READ: IN ALASKA, A JEWISH MUSEUM SURVIVES AGAINST THE ODDS

Afterwards, we visited Birzeit, a university town next to Jifna. Its ancient-feeling downtown, a cluster of narrow Jerusalem-stone alleys, is kept fresh with colourfully-painted tires, repurposed as plant pots, dangling from the walls.

We walked to a mom-and-son restaurant called Falafel Republic for lunch, which served up – I say this with apologies to Israelis everywhere – the best falafel I’ve ever eaten, with a perfectly crisped exterior and spicy, verdant filling.

The menu isn’t in English, so the son, Peter, simply asked us, “What do you like to eat? Some vegetables? Tomato? Eggplant?” Sure, we replied, all that sounds good. Twenty minutes later, Peter returned with a steaming bowl of spicy tomato sauce, beautifully plated hummus and a rich medley of eggplant, potato, cilantro and tahini.

I paired the meal with a blond ale from Shepherds Beer, brewed a few blocks down the road. The brewery was our next stop. (There are a handful of breweries in the Christian regions here. The biggest one, Taybeh, struck me more as the Molson Canadian of the West Bank, a mediocre and popular light beer. Shepherds’ stuff is seriously good by international standards.)

Khalid Sayej took us on a tour of the brewery. He’s one of three brothers who, along with their late father, founded the company in 2013, relying on a tremendous amount of loans. The bottling machine alone cost 600,000 euros. Even importing empty beer bottles from Turkey – because where else could they find 72,000 empties in a mostly Muslim region with limited recycling infrastructure? – takes an extra two weeks getting through the Israeli port authority.

The brothers are determined to make it work. When I asked why, Sayej’s response was almost absurdly simple: “We love beer.” When I asked if they ever considered setting up shop in a friendlier economy, he made clear their goal was to create opportunities for Palestinians. They don’t rely on government support, nor are they distressed by Israeli bureaucratic headaches. They steamroll ahead with innovative solutions and a dream, like any good capitalist enterprise.

In fact, Sayej laments how little Birzeit’s municipal government does to promote local tourism. He gestured outside to the heaps of trash and sideways dumpsters lining the dusty streets. Harsh winds wail against half-constructed houses dotting the roadside.

But it’s unfair to blame the government alone for the region’s poor tourist infrastructure. The Khouriyas noticed a significant drop in West Bank tourism since the 2014 Gaza War, even though Gaza is more than 100 kilometres away. Internationally, as in

Israel, many lump together and avoid all Palestinian areas as equally lethal.

Issa resents this, but he’s long stopped believing a solution will be found in his lifetime. While driving us down a curvy highway, he barely blinked when I asked about the possibility of peace.

“There’s no hope,” he replied curtly, staring straight ahead. “Nothing. From both sides. Nobody is looking for real peace.” In that moment, I recognized the conviction of my Israeli uncle. The two men will probably never meet, but if they did, I think they’d get along.","A visit to Palestine, minus the politics",Canadian Jewish News,https://www.cjnews.com/culture/travel/a-visit-to-palestine-minus-the-politics

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political ...,"With his win in the federal bye-election in Burnaby South, New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh has an opportunity to put to rest some of his doubters both outside the party and, more importantly, within. Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This bye-election win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the New Democratic Party shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the party’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal New Democratic Party came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the National Democratic Party persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the bye-election, the National Democratic Party would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the party in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, New Democratic Party fundraising – already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election – continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the New Democratic Party out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this bye-election win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the bye-election was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the party announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the New Democratic Party. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the New Democratic Party can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the New Democratic Party in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the New Democratic Party to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilised members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this bye-election win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.

I grew up in small-town Western ...,"I can’t remember feeling more proud to be Canadian than I have since Jody Wilson-Raybould began speaking to the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday afternoon.

As a little kid at Nov. 11 cenotaph ceremonies, I might have been as proud in the misty half-understood way of childhood.

When Paul Henderson scored the immortal winning goal in the legendary 1972 Canada-Russia hockey series, I was certainly more euphoric.

And the way Canadians responded to 2014’s perceived terror attack on Parliament, I realized in my deep heart’s core how much I loved this hugely improbable country and its thoroughly good and decent populace.

But watching Canada’s former attorney general, Justice minister, and Veterans Affairs minister lay out in exquisite detail her side of the SNC-Lavalin scandal, I felt a pride that rivalled all those events. At times, it far surpassed them.

I’m in no way shy to acknowledge much of it was attributable to Wilson-Raybould’s remarkable personal presence as an Indigenous woman, levelly speaking to her peers as an MP, and implacably challenging the highest levels of political power in this country.

I grew up in small-town Western Canada where, paradoxically, we were proud to have elected the first “Indian” in Canada as an MP largely because it meant we could overlook our ingrained habit of treating our Indigenous neighbours like dirt much of the rest of the time.

So to see such a profound example of an individual transcending racist attitudes – never mind our far more serious historic obstacles to Indigenous equality – made me sit up straighter. It made me intensely aware of that rare moment when pride avoids the ever-present heinous temptation toward arrogance and goes straight to becoming full-fledged hope. Hope, that is, for this country in all its breathtaking improbabilities.

I don’t mean to take an iota away from Wilson-Raybould’s individual triumph of will. She did it. She achieved. She stood defiant. She called out power.

But no one, least of all a politician, flourishes in a vacuum of individuality. Wilson-Raybould’s emergence is illustrative of a capacity traceable to the very seedbed of what it means to be Canadian: our willingness to atone, adapt, reconcile, grow, welcome anew.

The quality of her presence before the justice committee was hers and hers alone. But the system had room for it to happen. The institution worked.

It worked in that the committee gave her a fully-protected venue in which she could speak with utter freedom. It gave her an effective place to go after she elected to stand up and then step forward.

It must be emphasized, too, that the democratic watchdog relationship between the media and the political estate, starting with the phenomenal old-school scoop of the Globe and Mail team, functioned as it should.

And all of that turned the pride I felt into a veritable dirigible of hope.

Did the former minister’s testimony root out all the rot that leads political leaders and their minions to privilege a corrupt, legally-imperilled corporate behemoth over our rule of law?

No.

Are we out of the woods in terms of the threat the SNC-Lavalin scandal poses to Canada’s political ecology?

By no means. As the justice committee members agreed during Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, the real work has only just begun.

But begin it has. Proceed it can. And Wilson-Raybould gives hopeful evidence of enough quality individuals in place to see it through. That, in turn, obliges all of us to dispense with the grotesque, lazy cliché that every politician is only in it for himself or herself.

Absolutely, we must be alert us to the pressing need for vigilance about corruption’s presence and spread. But despair?

Uh-uh

Shame?

Not here. Not now.

In fact, just the opposite after what Wilson-Raybould did, and was institutionally able to do, in one glorious and free committee appearance on Wednesday afternoon.

Unless you lived under a rock this February, you’ll know that a pro-Trans Mountain pipeline convoy called ‘United We Roll’ made its way from Red Deer all the way to Parliament Hill. The convoy enjoyed over a week of doting media attention as a steady part of the media cycle.

What you might not know from media coverage is that racist and anti-immigrant sentiments were propagated by the convoy’s organizers and participants alongside their pro-energy message. The convoy was originally called the Yellow Vest Convoy, in reference to the Canadian yellow-vest movement, whose members frequently spread hateful rhetoric against immigrants, particularly Muslims. It’s clear from photos of signs carried by vehicles as part of the convoy — “NO UN/GLOBALISM,” “Open borders breed chaos,” “Trudeau for treason” — that these views are, at the very least, auxiliary to its pro-pipeline message.

There’s mountains of evidence showing that the United We Roll convoy was a part of a larger, radical movement spreading xenophobic rhetoric, much of it compiled by the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. It’s clear that though these groups’ agendas may include building a pipeline and supporting Canada’s energy industry, those are far from the only beliefs they wish to spread.

A number of prominent politicians lent their support to the convoy. Most notable of these was federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who spoke to members of the convoy during a rally on Parliament Hill. White nationalist Faith Goldy was among other speakers at the same rally.

Another Parliament Hill speaker was Saskatchewan Senator David Tkachuk, who encouraged the crowd to “roll over every liberal left in the country.” And while they weren’t present at the rallies, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Alberta Opposition leader Jason Kenney each tweeted their support for the convoy. Many high-profile voices gave the convoy credence while doing nothing to denounce the racist views inextricably tied to the movement.

The views propagated by members of the yellow-vest movement are the same kind of rhetoric that radicalized Alexandre Bissonnette, the man who killed six Muslim men in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. There are countless other examples of these hateful views spilling over into real-life violence against marginalized communities.

But it’s important to emphasize that those who participated in the convoy do not represent Albertans at large. While the yellow-vest movement brings with it some effective imagery, with the vests themselves serving as a cheap and readily obtainable symbol of the working class, it’s hard to believe that the few hundred convoy members who were able to take off from their jobs for a week while spending hundreds in fuel and accommodations are actually indicative of the average Albertan oil and gas worker. Yes, people who believe in a cause can make arrangements to allow themselves to participate in demonstrations like this. But it’s absolutely not something that the vast majority of Albertans are able to do.

Talking about pipelines when talking about the United We Roll convoy buys into exactly what the convoy’s members and organizers want you to do — normalize their radical views under the guise of support for the oil and gas sector.

Divisive rhetoric will inevitably ramp up as the upcoming provincial election nears. Conversations about the pipeline and Alberta’s economy will be front-and-centre during that time. These are reasonable and necessary conversations — but there will likely be exclusionary and dangerous rhetoric alongside it. Make an effort to digest the political messages you see through a critical lens throughout this election cycle and beyond.

With many of Maduro’s opponents in jail or barred from running for office and the country’s legislative system already weakened under his rule, opposition leaders had urged international observers not to travel to Caracas to lend legitimacy to the May 2018 proceedings.

Eight months later, amid mass demonstrations and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, the legislative assembly’s leader, Juan Guaido, is trying to trigger a constitutional mechanism that allows for a challenge of illegitimate leadership. Canada, the U.S. and a host of Latin American and European countries have recognized Guaido as interim president, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bluntly accused Maduro of “dictatorship” Monday.

The group of six Canadian observers, among them representatives of Common Frontiers, Unifor, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF), the United Church of Canada and Rabble.ca, lauded Venezuela’s “strong and vibrant democracy,” however, in a report published by Common Frontiers after the May 2018 trip. United Steelworkers and a Toronto personal injury law firm, Carranza LLP, also provided “delegation support,” according to the report.

“We witnessed a transparent, secure, democratic and orderly electoral and voting process,” the document concludes. “Our delegation was impressed by the electoral process and felt confident that the results of the elections represent the will of the majority of Venezuelans who voted.”

Meanwhile, an Organization of American States panel of human rights experts conducted hearings last year and concluded Maduro’s regime should be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, including thousands of cases of murder, torture and imprisonment against the political opposition. Canada, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru did so in September.

“The notion that free and fair elections could possibly be taking place when you not only criminalize those who are on the opposition … but when you don’t have any allowance for expressions of freedom of speech, assembly, association and the like, simply is a non-sequitur,” said Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister who sat on the panel. “I think part of the problem with the labour groups who went down there is that they seem to be acting reflexively out of a political agenda rather than a human rights agenda. Out of a left-right agenda rather than a right-wrong approach.”

Alessandra Polga, a Venezuelan living in Canada who works on behalf of Venezuelan political prisoners, said she is concerned about “aggressive” left-wing groups advocating for Maduro’s regime in Canada.

Common Frontiers, which organized the delegation and issued the report, claims “active” support from a long list of labour groups, including the Canadian Union of Public Employees. Its website invites supporters to petition the Canadian government against leading the Lima Group, which saw the foreign ministers of Canada, Brazil, Argentina and eight other countries convene in Ottawa Monday to discuss support for Guaido.

CUPE provides funding to Common Frontiers as part of “global justice work,” said spokesman Hugh Pouliot, which in recent years was largely focused on the renegotiation of NAFTA. A source inside a public-sector union said such groups are usually run independently and have a contact person within each union.

A recent statement from CUPE on the Venezuelan situation was in line with Common Frontiers’ position, however. It said Maduro was “duly elected” and criticized the Canadian government for helping Guaido organize a “coup d’état.” Pouliot said he was not aware of any pushback from members as a result of the statement.

Asked on Monday to respond to fears on the left that Canada is facilitating imperialism, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said she finds the idea difficult to justify and hers is a pro-democracy position. The NDP, which had been hitherto agnostic, clarified its own position when foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière said Monday she now accepts the Liberal government’s recognition of Guaido — just not how they went about it.

The National Post reached Raul Burbano of Common Frontiers Monday but he did not respond to questions. The Post made efforts to seek comment from all organizations that sent delegates or lent financial support but not all responded.

The United Church provided $1,500 to help with costs, according to spokeswoman Catherine Rodd, but their Latin America program’s Jim Hodgson, who was part of the delegation, was unavailable Monday. Hodgson wrote favourably about the trip for Rabble.ca at the end of May and questioned why Canada would not defend Venezuelan sovereignty against “U.S. aggression.”

CUPW provided financial support for Don Foreman’s travels, which included meetings with the Venezuelan postal workers union — but he was there “on behalf of Common Frontiers,” according to the union. “While groups such as the Lima Group (led) by Canada are screaming fraud and government interference in the election process, not one shred of evidence has been produced to back up such claims,” Foreman is quoted as saying in the report.

The OSSTF representative is quoted saying Canadians could “learn a lot” from the way elections are conducted in Venezuela, and the Rabble.ca representative is quoted saying it should be an “international gold standard.” Neither organization responded to the Post’s request for comment. United Steelworkers referred the Post to Burbano.

OTTAWA – Canada and Mexico may be united in wanting to bring closure to North America’s unresolved trading future, but they are diametrically opposed on how to solve Venezuela’s political and economic crisis.

The cleavage between Canada and Mexico over the upheaval enveloping their broader hemispheric neighbourhood – the meltdown of once prosperous Venezuela that has spawned a three-million-plus refugee crisis – was on full display this week as lawmakers from both countries met in Ottawa to discuss their shared interests.

Mexico was a charter member of the Lima Group of countries when it formed in August 2017 before socialist firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1 as Mexico’s new president.

Lopez Obrador’s government has been conspicuously absent from the Lima Group’s recent declarations recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim leader of Venezuela, and the group’s calls for the military to switch allegiance to him from the country’s socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.

“It’s a very complex issue because we believe – the new government believes strongly – in not intervening in the internal affairs of other countries,” Sen. Hector Vasconcelos, head of the Mexican senate’s foreign affairs committee, said in an interview.

Part of that complexity involves the other major North American country that was never in the Lima Group – the United States.

As Canadian officials routinely explain, not having the U.S. in the Lima Group coalition of more than a dozen Western Hemisphere countries is seen as effective. The reason is because it divorces calls for Maduro’s ouster from the baggage of what is seen as past American meddling in Latin America.

Many don’t buy that rationale, pointing to the fact that the U.S. remains in lock-step with the Lima Group while the Trump administration refuses to rule out potential military action in Venezuela.

“When you have a major international power trying to impose a solution to a political situation, to a political crisis anywhere in the world, not only in Latin America, the prospects for success are not very good,” said Vasconcelos.

He cited American interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan in this century and Vietnam four decades ago as some U.S. failures.

Mexico has offered to mediate between Guaido and Maduro to find a solution that’s satisfactory to the Venezuelan people, Vasconcelos said.

Canada, its Lima Group allies, the U.S. and dozens of other countries say international support for the opposition is intended to embolden Venezuelans, with the help of a military it wants to see switch loyalties, to take democratic control of their country.

Vasconcelos said he’s OK if the Venezuelan military switches sides and contributes to Maduro’s peaceful ouster.

“If the armed forces decide to stop supporting president Maduro, then that would be finding an internal solution,” he said, stressing that doesn’t mark a departure from the current Mexican position. “Believe me there are reasons for this. And I think that Mexico derives benefits from that position even today after 100 years of trying to follow that line.”

A Liberal MP who took part in this week’s parliamentary meetings with Mexico says Canada is trying to persuade Mexico to support the Lima Group.

“Obviously, Canada has a difference of opinion. We think Mexico, as a serious player in the hemisphere, should be working with us. They haven’t walked away from Lima necessarily, but they’re being very cautious,” said Bob Nault, the former head of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee.

“My advice is to keep working with Mexico very quietly to convince them the policy of the past is not going to work in the scenario that’s unfolding in Venezuela and other countries.”

Despite the difference on Venezuela, Vasconcelos and other members of the Lopez Obrador’s governing Morena party see several broad areas of co-operation with Canada. In addition to ratifying the newly renegotiated North American free trade pact, these issues include trying to tackle the northward flood of migrants from Central America, and combating climate change without a willing partner in the United States.

“Mexico and Canada agree on many things, but not the United States and that’s an awful thing because the United States, their environmental impact is really big,” said Mexican Sen. Antares Guadalupe, also a Morena member.

“It is important to try and get the United States with us in these efforts.”

Andrew Jackson is Adjunct Research Professor in the Institute of Political Economy at Carleton University, and senior policy adviser to the Broadbent Institute.","Statistics Canada has just released the Canadian Income Survey for 2017.

This allows us to look at changes in income, income inequality and poverty over the first two years of the federal Liberal government.

Income growth, overall, was very modest. When adjusted for inflation, the average after tax income of all families and individuals rose by just 2.8%, from $71,200 in 2015 to $73,200 in 2017.

The average income of the top 10% of families and individuals rose from $197,200 to $201,400 and their share of all after tax income remained almost the same, 27.7% in 2015 and 27.5% in 2017.

The rate of poverty for all Canadians fell from 14.2% to 12.7% using the Low Income Measure (LIM), which defines poverty as having less than one half of the median or mid point income of a similar family. Based on the proposed new official measure of poverty, formalized by the federal government last year, the basic needs or Market Basket Measure (MBM), poverty fell significantly more, from 13.3% to 9.0%.

The child poverty rate fell from 13.3% to 9.0% according to the Market Basket Measure, due to the introduction of a reformed system of child tax credits in 2016. Using the Low Income Measure, it fell from 15.2% to 12.1%.

However, the poverty rate for seniors rose from 14.3% in 2015 to 15.4% in 2017 using the Low Income Measure. While the senior poverty rate is lower using the MBM measure (just 3.9% in 2017), despite the incomes of many seniors are lagging behind those of working age Canadians.

Changes to market incomes, taxes and income transfer programs have had some impact upon poverty, but less impact on income inequality which seems to have changed very little over the first two years of Liberal government.

While both measures are useful, a basic needs measure like the MBM only tells us that low income people can survive. The LIM tells us how many people are distant from the social mainstream.

Detectives have begun investigating whether some of the thousands of angry online texts Chemi Lhamo received after being elected as a University of Toronto student-union president constitute criminal threats, Toronto police confirmed Wednesday.

The Internet barrage — and a petition signed by 11,000 people demanding Lhamo be removed from the position — was one of two incidents at Ontario universities this month that have raised the spectre of Chinese government interference on Canadian campuses.

Muslim and Tibetan student groups have called on the federal government to investigate whether such incursions did occur. China’s embassy in Ottawa has denied playing a part in either episode.

Meanwhile, Lhamo said university police have asked her to develop a safety plan in the wake of the online deluge, which would include letting them know where she is on campus hour by hour.

We came to Canada hoping for a better quality of life. To be bullied even here … catches up on your mental health sometimes

“It is a little threatening, to be roaming around hallways knowing that at any time I could be attacked,” she said in an interview. “We came to Canada hoping for a better quality of life. To be bullied even here … catches up on your mental health sometimes.”

Lhamo, 22, is a Canadian citizen of Tibetan descent who immigrated from India with her family 11 years ago. She was elected as president of the student union at the U of T’s Scarborough campus in early February. Though she is an advocate for Tibetan independence, she did not campaign on that issue and says she has no plans to make it part of her role as president.

But in the wake of her election, thousands of messages flooded her Instagram account, often crudely abusive and accusing her of being disloyal to China, a country where she has never lived.

The change.org petition — digitally signed almost entirely by people with Chinese names — suggested that her devotion to the Tibetan cause is “irrational” and an affront to international students at the university.

Beijing sees the movement for a free Tibet as a major threat; along with advocacy for the Uyghur minority, Taiwan, democracy in China and the Falun Gong sect, it is one of what the Chinese Communist party sometimes calls the “five poisons.”

Lhamo said the Instagram texts included ones saying “Wish you would die young”; “The bullet for your penalty is made in China”; and “I kill all your family.”

The section of the Criminal Code dealing with harassment makes it an offence to engage in threatening behaviour or repeatedly communicate in a way that leaves someone fearing for their safety.

It’s too early, though, to say if any criminal acts did occur, said Det. Anthony Rutherford, who is heading the Toronto police review after an earlier investigation by campus police.

“There are approximately 15,000 different posts in various languages,” he said. “We’re going to have to go through all that … It needs some follow-up and more time.”

An online update to the petition said it was not meant as a “personal attack, character assassination or threat of any kind,” but to voice disapproval of Lhamo’s “participation in political campaigns that were clearly against Chinese history, Chinese laws and Chinese students’ rights.”

The unsigned note warned, however, against posting abusive or threatening messages that would “greatly influence … how others think about Chinese international students.”

The other incident occurred at McMaster University in Hamilton, where five Chinese student groups protested the university’s decision to allow a talk by Rukiye Turdush, a Canadian citizen of Uyghur background. Turdush discussed human-rights abuses against the Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group in China whose persecution has been well documented by Western media and human-rights organizations.

A statement posted by the Chinese students said the talk incited anti-China hatred, and mentioned they had notified their home country’s consulate in Toronto.

Students for a Free Tibet co-signed the letter requesting a federal probe of Beijing’s possible role, but Lhamo said she had no proof that Chinese officials were involved in the backlash against her.

Chrystia Freeland, the country’s popular foreign minister, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that she had “100 per cent” faith in the 47-year-old.

On Wednesday Jody Wilson-Raybould, Mr Trudeau’s former justice minister, publicly accused government officials of a consistent and sustained effort to pressure her into helping a major construction company avoid a corruption trial.

Her testimony triggered immediate calls for the prime minister’s resignation.

SNC-Lavalin, a construction and engineering firm, was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that Mr Trudeau, his staff and other officials “barraged” and “hounded” her while trying to convince her to avoid a criminal prosecution of the company.

She said they instead pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

SNC-Lavalin employs around 9,000 people in Canada, with about 3,400 of those employees based in Quebec, a key province for Mr Trudeau’s Liberal Party.

The party needs to increase its number of seats in the province to retain its hold on the Canadian government.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said the prime minister warned her that a criminal prosecution would drive the firm and its jobs out of Canada. She also complained of pressure from Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau’s former principal secretary.

Mr Trudeau has acknowledged discussing the firm with his former justice secretary but claims the issue was raised in an appropriate manner.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done,” he said on Thursday.

“We’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws.”

“The prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” Ms Freeland, seen by some as a possible successor, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Another senior Liberal Party official said that there was no discussion, for now, about replacing Mr Trudeau as party leader.

But the prime minister is facing opposition calls to resign and the scandal could prove damaging as the country prepares for federal elections in October.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was demoted to veterans’ affairs minister in January and resigned from the cabinet on 12 February.

She remains a member of the Liberal Party.

OTTAWA – Canada and Britain will co-host an international summit in London this summer on the growing threats to freedom of the press, and to promote better protection of journalists, The Canadian Press has learned.

Sources say Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland – a journalist before she entered politics – and her British counterpart Jeremy Hunt have been working on the idea for months.

Canadian officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the conference before it was formally announced.

Sources say the talks between Freeland and Hunt have progressed to the point where they have now set a date for a two-day gathering starting July 10, which will include members of governments, civil society and journalists.

They say Freeland has been influenced by two high-profile cases: the imprisonment of two Reuters reporters who were sentenced to seven-year terms in Myanmar for violating the country’s Official Secrets Act and the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul last fall.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the news media “the enemy of the people,” but sources denied suggestions that his anti-media rhetoric was also a factor.

“It’s a theme Minister Freeland has been thinking a lot about in general, particularly because of the cases of the two journalists in Myanmar and the Khashoggi case,” said one source.

“But also in general, the current climate is affecting journalist’s ability to do their work freely.” Freeland and Hunt “have this shared concern and that was the genesis of all of this.”

Freeland says Khashoggi case not closed; but Trump says facts may never be known

Freeland, who used to work at Reuters, condemned the seven-year sentences meted out to Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were reporting on the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar’s Rakhine State. A military crackdown drove an estimated 900,000 Rohingya out of Myanmar and into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The two journalists were reporting on a massacre of the Rohingya people by the Myanmar military in 2017 and say they were framed by police.

“This verdict gravely undermines the rule of law and freedom of the press in Myanmar, and betrays the decades-long struggle by the Myanmar people for democracy,” Freeland said in a written statement in September.

Britain and the United States also condemned the verdict, along with numerous international human rights organizations.

Freeland has called Khashoggi’s killing “abhorrent and represents an unconscionable attack on the freedom of expression and freedom of the press.” Canada also imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis linked to killing, freezing their assets and barring them from entering the country.

She has repeatedly called for an independent international investigation so Khashoggi’s killers can be brought to justice.

Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have repeatedly defended a free press as a necessary part of a thriving democracy. While they have not criticized Trump directly, their steadfast defence of the media has come amid unprecedented attacks on press freedom by the American president.

Trump has called the news media “the enemy of the people” and derided it for selling “fake news” to its readers. He has also called journalists “crazed lunatics.”

“The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party,” Trump said in one January Tweet. “It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!”

In December, the rights group Reporters Without Borders reported that the United States had, for the first time, formally entered the ranks of the top five deadliest countries in the world for journalists to work.

On June 28, four journalists and a sales associate were killed by a gunman who opened fire in the offices of the Maryland newspaper Capital Gazette in what was the deadliest attack on the media in recent U.S. history.

In December, the annual report by the Committee to Protect Journalists said the number of journalists killed across the world in retaliation for their work nearly doubled in 2018.

It said that 34 journalist were killed in retaliation for their work, while at least 53 were killed overall. In 2017, 18 journalists were killed in retaliation while 47 were counted overall.","Freeland, Hunt to announce Canadian British press freedom summit this summer",Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/freeland-hunt-to-announce-canadian-british-press-freedom-summit-this-summer-227690/

A Windsor law firm is filing a class action lawsuit against SNC Lavalin and some of the company’s officers and directors.

Strosberg, Sasso, Sutts has been retained by a shareholder of the Quebec engineering company at the centre of the political scandal involving the Prime Minister's office.

The proposed class action has been filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of all persons, excluding certain persons associated with the defendants, who acquired securities of SNC during the period from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10, 2018.

The plaintiff alleges the defendants failed to disclose in a timely manner the decision of the Director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada that it was not appropriate to invite SNC to negotiate a remediation agreement.

“Disclosure is the cornerstone of the Canadian capital markets,” according to Jay Strosberg, a managing partner at Strosberg Sasso Sutts LLP. “We look forward to SNC’s explanation as to why it delayed disclosure until October 10, 2018.”

Once this information was revealed, the law firm says the price of SNC securities dropped significantly, causing substantial damages to holders of SNC securities.

The plaintiff seeks $75 million in damages for negligent misrepresentation and liability for secondary market disclosure pursuant to Ontario’s Securities Act.

Securities holders wishing to obtain more information can visit https://www.strosbergco.com/class-actions/snc/.

The legal action is separate from any action involving SNC Lavalin on Parliament Hill.

Jody Wilson-Raybould has accepted the House Justice Committee's invitation to testify on the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday, now that the government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence.

Her appearance will be the first time she speaks publicly and in detail in the 20 days since the allegations of political pressure being placed on her by members of the PMO in regards to an ongoing criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, were reported in The Globe and Mail.

The committee has agreed to a request Wilson-Raybould made in writing on Monday: that she be granted an ""extended opening statement"" lasting 30 minutes during which she would be able to go through everything she recalls about communications she was involved in regarding SNC-Lavalin. Most opening statements at committees are limited to 10 minutes.

In her letter, Wilson-Raybould said that she is ""anxious"" to appear and wrote that she'd be happy to stay for as long as the committee wishes to answer questions.

Over the last few weeks the opposition parties have focused in on this scandal, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling it a ""textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the prime minister's office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice."" The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have sought to have Trudeau and several senior PMO staff believed to be central to the story testify, and a public inquiry called, with no success.

On Feb. 7, citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported that Trudeau's office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. CTV News has not independently verified the story.

Remediation agreements — or Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) — can include having the company accept responsibility, denounce the wrongdoing, vow to implement corrective measures, and pay financial penalties.

In contrast, if the company was criminally convicted it would be banned from securing Canadian government contracts for a decade, potentially putting jobs on the line.",Windsor law firm filing class action lawsuit against SNC Lavalin,CTV News,https://windsor.ctvnews.ca/windsor-law-firm-filing-class-action-lawsuit-against-snc-lavalin-1.4315121

It’s a competitive sort of cultural identity. The Irish-descendant ...,"Occasionally people will ask for the meaning of my name. It’s not uncommon — everyone seems to know these days and is ready to tell you that “Sarah means princess!” or that “Katelyn means pure!” People like having names with definitions like that: a single, positive adjective that they can attach to their identity like a zodiac sign, as if the moniker their parents picked at their birth has any bearing on their personality.

My name is a little bit harder to define.

The answer I’ll give depends on my audience. The short answer is “Oh, it’s a place in Ireland.” The longer answer is “It’s the place where the kings of Ireland lived.” These seem to satisfy people, but it’s always a bit disappointing when everyone else can say “My name means beautiful!” or whatever other oversimplified descriptor they’ve come to from centuries of linguistic evolution. The “true” definition of my name is as follows: “an anglicization of the Gaelic Teamhair, which was the Hill of Kings in Ancient Ireland, which in turn took its name from a legendary queen named Téa.” I understand the allure of being able to define your name with a simple, attractive definition like “beautiful” or “pure.” What’s the fun of being named after some long-forgotten ruin in a country half a world away?

My name is the reason I started learning Gaelic. I couldn’t fit my anglicized vocal cords around the strange sounds of my own name in its original form. Nowadays I can say hello, introduce myself and curse at someone to kiss a certain body part. That is the sum of my knowledge of my ancestral language and when I speak I could make all of it up because I don’t know a single other person who speaks it. The vestigial Gaelic of my name is one of the only things that ties me to the culture of my ancestors. I’m third-generation Canadian. I have no family left in Ireland and I certainly wouldn’t qualify for dual citizenship. However, I have this strange, undefinable Gaelic name — one last line connecting me to my pre-Canadian roots.

Growing up in Canada, I was always aware of our “multicultural mosaic.” All my friends were “_____-Canadians” of some sort. I loved being able to experience so many cultures growing up, but I’ve always wondered why none of us were ever just Canadians. In the fourth grade, we had a culture fair where every student prepared traditional food from their culture. Mine was Irish, of course, and my nine-year-old self pored over Wikipedia trying to understand a culture that I was supposedly a part of, despite not having been raised in it. When another student chose their culture of origin as “Canada” — with all-dressed chips as a traditional dish — everyone was speechless. “Yeah, we’re all Canadian, but aren’t you something else too?” That was the first moment I remember where being Canadian didn’t feel like enough.

For those of us whose hereditary connection to another nation is a hand-me-down, is the modifier before “Canadian” necessary? The phrase “Irish-Canadian” always felt defensive in my mouth like I needed to have examples of my Irishness on hand in case someone questioned it. I’m always ready to list off the Irish names of my extended family, to curse in Gaelic or to rattle off facts about Irish politics until whoever asked regrets doing so. It’s a competitive sort of cultural identity.

The Irish-descendant populations of Canada and the United States are substantial due to the mass exodus from Ireland after the Great Famine. In the two centuries since, we’ve expanded to occupy a noticeable portion of the general population and the remnants of our previous culture have held on stubbornly — the enduring tradition of the “Irish” pub, the raucous festivities of St. Patrick’s Day where everyone claims to be “Irish for the day.” However, like most of the Irish-descendant population, North American “Irish” traditions bear limited similarity to their cultural ancestors. St. Pat’s has evolved into an excuse to party and pretend we like Guinness, and one rarely comes across an “Irish” pub serving solely Irish cuisine. The Irish connection we claim is tenuous — but Irish-Canadians continue to hold on to it with a proud stubbornness.

The question I think we must ask ourselves is “Why?” Why is our identity not complete by sole virtue of our Canadianness?

I was born in Canada to parents born in Canada, without a single word of Gaelic between them besides the names they gave my brother and me. I say I’m Irish-Canadian, but the flag I sewed on my backpack is red and white, with a passport to match. My children will be Irish only by virtue of the names I choose or choose not to give them as they move further and further from our ancestors. To everyone other than myself, I am just Canadian like the millions of other Canadians whose ancestral heritage is several generations too far to reach. Can we deal with being just Canadian, without modifications?

From most points of view, it is the Canadian facet of my identity that is most important. This is the only nation in which I can vote. When I travel outside these borders, I’ll tell people “soy canadiense.” I’ll uphold the tradition of smugly looking down on our American neighbours. Can I still define myself as Irish, when my Canadianness is my defining feature? From Ireland, I have a name, a great-great-grandfather and a somewhat misplaced sense of national pride in a country I didn’t visit for the first time until I was 17.

Am I Irish? I still don’t have an answer as to whether or not my Irish heritage is part of my identity — or whether or not I am Irish enough to count. The only answer I can give is that I hope that one day Canadian will be enough for us, without any hyphenated modification in the front to separate ourselves from Canada",Canadian Enough,The Ubyssey,https://www.ubyssey.ca/magazine/irish-canadian-identity/

The series features 6 young black Canadian women with images of themselves as children with an accompanying Q&A on the theme of holding onto your inner child: that magic and uniqueness that gets suppressed as you get older and what you can say to your inner child as you're growing up to protect your spirit and help yourself heal and grow.

Looking through childhood photos can be both nostalgic and emotional. We see the beauty, the scars and the passions we carried that helped us develop into the person we have become. We remember that, from childhood to adulthood, one goes through many journeys — physical, emotional and spiritual.

There are multiple factors that affect one's development, and everyone's journeys are personal. Being a young Black woman means one's journeys are impacted by race, gender and history, which shape our experiences in significant ways.

But as we grow and learn about the world, experience society, take on responsibilities and transition from infants to full-on grown ups, what happens to the hopes and dreams we once had as children? Are they still deep within us? Have they already come to fruition? Or have they changed altogether?

What happens to the traumas we've experienced? Are they still haunting us, and have they altered the way we function? And what of the magic and uniqueness that we carried — is it just suppressed underneath the person we've become?

To connect with one's inner child is to reconnect with a pure energy, to tend to issues we've held on to and to help ourselves continue to grow into balanced human beings. This Black History Month, I spoke to six young, creative Black women looking to celebrate their inner child and reconnect with her — to uncover that magical and distinctive child-self that lies within them.

Connecting with your younger self is a process and an ongoing journey. Do you remember what activities or passions you used to love when you were a child?

My earliest memories of my childhood passions seem to always exist around the beautiful concept of community and helping others. I grew up in an Islamic Nigerian household, which, by default, required me to give back to the community by volunteering regularly. For my sixth birthday I begged my mother to enroll me into the Girl Guides association. In a way, the journey has never ended.

If you could meet your child-self face to face today and have a conversation, what dreams would you reconnect with?

We would definitely have a very fruitful conversation. I am not necessarily the world-travelling nurse she dreamt of me being. However, I am sure she would be happy to know that we are still very dedicated to nurturing and helping others through innovative ways.

What advice would you give to your younger self, knowing all that you know now?

Note to my younger self: you will have to face plenty of adversity too early, too often and it will be experienced quite rapidly. You will have to sacrifice your childhood in order to hone your life-survival skills. You will constantly feel hurt and misunderstood. One day, you will begin to listen to your intuition [and] have more trust in yourself. From there, your resilience and ability to love limitlessly will guide you into the aligned path designed to fulfil your purpose.

How does connecting with this inner child make you feel? Does it bring up certain thoughts or ideas, or reawaken any ambitions?

I've spent the last two years connecting with my inner child. I did not realize how much I suppressed the pain and confusion I was exposed to during my early childhood years. My inner child was yearning to be loved and healed. This healing process remains ongoing, because I refuse to silence the little girl in me ever again.

There's a sense of magic and uniqueness in our child-selves that gets somewhat suppressed as we get older. What rituals or passions do you practice now as acts of self care for your health and well-being?

I journalled a lot growing up — it was my only escape growing up as the youngest of seven. As I bloomed into adulthood, I discovered yoga, hypnosis, meditation, reiki...all of which led me to the reintroduction to my ancestral powers, [which were] waiting for me to tap into [them].

Since then, I've been discovering different spiritual ways to heal that work for me. My well-being rituals are actually what led me to creating HERDAY. I realized that there were not enough inclusive events or spaces in the city where I could freely express myself in an intimate setting with other women in a style that I would like to — I was tired of being boxed in as the ""angry Black woman"" or the strong and mighty ""superwoman."" So I created one.

Reconnecting with your inner child is a process for analyzing and understanding your roots. Like Black History Month, this experience is a time of reflection, a celebration of how far we've come and an opportunity to to raise awareness of how much more work there is to do. What does Black History Month mean to you?

Black History Month has often felt like a reminder for us to love our community a little extra and celebrate surviving being Black in North America. As I am aware of my Nigerian roots and proudly represent my Africanness while living in Canada 365 days a year, I unapologetically celebrate being a Black woman every single second I get to.

Connecting with your younger self is a process and an ongoing journey. Do you remember what activities or passions you used to love when you were a child?

Since I was a child, I have always loved creating and using my imagination. I loved to draw, write stories, take pictures, make art. I loved challenging ideas and understanding the hows and whys of the world. In school, I was drawn to assignments and projects that allowed me to be creative, and I excelled at them.

I have made an effort to stay connected to these parts of myself, especially considering the world we live in. Our world is riddled with so many labels and definitive ideas about existence, and, for me, imagination and creativity are key factors to living happily on my own terms.

If you could meet your child-self face to face today and have a conversation, what dreams would you reconnect with?

As a child, I wanted to make the world a better place. I liked making others happy, and I loved connecting with people. My dreams as a child were tied to a desire to bring more goodness to the world. That is something I would discuss with my child-self, because as children, we are given more space to be our most authentic selves. We love, we play, we exist and we express ourselves more organically than we do as adults.

As we grow older, so much of that bliss and that authenticity is taken from us. The world becomes a place of constraints, rather than a platform for expression. I would tell my child-self to cherish that freedom as long as possible and learn as much as I could from our conversation.

What advice would you give to your younger self, knowing all that you know now?

""Never dim your light to make other people feel comfortable."" As a child, I didn't like when people were mad at me, and I carried that into adulthood. I care about other people's opinions more than I care to admit, and that has worked to my detriment in many ways. It disconnects me from myself. It disconnects me from the things that make me feel strong, empowered and unique — the things that define the best parts of who I am.

I've learned that connecting to those parts of myself will always threaten other people, especially when they are not connected to those things within themselves. I've learned that when people mistreat you, it has little to do with you and everything to do with how they see themselves. It can be really hard not to take those interactions personally but, at the end of the day, any person who asks you to suppress who you are — directly or indirectly — is not someone you should have in your life. They are not worth your time or your energy.

How does connecting with this inner child make you feel? Does it bring up certain thoughts or ideas, or reawaken any ambitions?

My inner child has been needing to tell me to chill out. I put a lot of pressure on myself. As adults, we have more experiences to help us guide our decisions, but the truth is everyday we are still learning. We are learning to love, we are learning who we are and we are learning about the world.

In order to learn, we need to make mistakes. I put a lot of pressure on myself to make the ""right"" decisions, and I am not very forgiving when I make mistakes — especially ones I anticipate. In this regard, I need to be kinder to myself, and I think my inner child would agree.

There's a magic and uniqueness in our child-selves that gets somewhat suppressed as we get older. What rituals or passions do you practice now as acts of self care for your health and well-being?

I love my time alone. I grew up as an only child, so I had a lot of time to myself. That time has been really important to the development of my creativity. It allowed me to be in my head, generate ideas and learn about things that interested me. I think that time is crucial to my health and well-being because it has given me the space to be myself and connect with the things that make me, me.

Reconnecting with your inner child is a process for analyzing and understanding your roots. Like Black History Month, this experience is a time of reflection, a celebration of how far we've come and an opportunity to raise awareness of how much more work there is to do. What does Black History Month mean to you?

Black history is history. It's time to rethink categorizing it as somehow separate from history generally. The project of whiteness succeeds by labelling itself as the neutral — meaning the experiences of white people and white culture are set as the standard everything else is measured against, and in relation to.

So in that sense, the idea of Black History Month kind of frustrates me. I understand the importance of it, but if history were discussed more accurately — in a way that de-centres whiteness — and systemic racism weren't so rampant within educational institutions, there wouldn't be a need for Black History Month.

Aside from that, I see Black History Month as an opportunity to celebrate Black culture and Black joy. In the media, representations of Blackness are often synonymous with Black pain, but Black people are so much more than our pain. Black History Month is another opportunity to reconnect with the strength that comes from my Blackness and my identity as a Black cis woman. There is a lot of power in my reality, and it is important to make the time to celebrate that.

Connecting with your younger self is a process and an ongoing journey. Do you remember what activities or passions you used to love when you were a child?

[From the age of] four to seven, I used to write and illustrate my own picture books. I was an only child with a mom who didn't believe in the concept of being bored, so I spent a lot of time falling in love with storytelling and expressing myself.

If you could meet your child-self face to face today and have a conversation, what dreams would you reconnect with?

I would reconnect with the unwavering confidence I had as a kid. I really thought that I could do anything, and I was relentless. As I grow as an artist and as an adult, I'm constantly trying to get back to believing in the power of dreams and shedding my fear of failure.

What advice would you give to your younger self, knowing all that you know now?

Pay attention to your intuition — you're right. Don't allow other people to project their limitations onto you and cause you to lose sight of what's true. Use your empathy to make yourself a better artist and person, but protect your energy. Most importantly: there's always more learning to do, and you can't rush your lessons.

How does connecting with this inner child make you feel? Does it bring up certain thoughts or ideas, or reawaken any ambitions?

Connecting with my inner child fills me with so much joy and excitement for my future. When I was younger, I would make those picture books because I had ideas that I needed to get out, and I was so eager to create and share. I think my inner child has been meaning to remind me of my capacity for joy and the beauty in sharing that with others.

There's a magic and uniqueness in our child-selves that gets somewhat suppressed as we get older. What rituals or passions do you practice now as acts of self care for your health and well-being?

Every morning, I dance and sing. It wakes me up, but honestly, more than anything, it makes me so happy. Obviously, it doesn't fix everything, and if I'm stressed I might just stay stressed, but pretending to be Teyana Taylor for at least 15 minutes a day really shifts my energy to a good place!

Reconnecting with your inner child is a process for analyzing and understanding your roots. Like Black History Month, this experience is a time of reflection, a celebration of how far we've come and an opportunity to raise awareness of how much more work there is to do. What does Black History Month mean to you?

Black History Month doesn't necessarily mean what it used to mean when I was younger. I've grown to be someone who is very proud of her Black heritage and culture, and manifesting that pride in every aspect of my life is a daily practice that is crucial to my well-being. What I like about Black History Month now is experiencing other people celebrate us.

Connecting with your younger self is a process and an ongoing journey. Do you remember what activities or passions you used to love when you were a child?

When I was a child, my passion was always writing! Never left the house without a notebook in my hand, doodling, journalling and being extremely dramatic in my poems. I also loved roller skating and bowling with my friends.

If you could meet your child-self face to face today and have a conversation, what dreams would you reconnect with?

One dream I'd love to reconnect [with] is writing a book. I was a huge bookworm, especially for fiction. I always wanted to write a fiction book that wasn't cliché or predictable — but epic. A book that everyone from all different walks of life would enjoy — the way I enjoyed reading books from Maya Angelou and Rainbow Rowell.

What advice would you give to your younger self, knowing all that you know now?

I would tell my younger self to stop shrinking who I am for the convenience of others.

How does connecting with this inner child make you feel? Does it bring up certain thoughts or ideas, or reawaken any ambitions?

Connecting with my inner child reminds me of how [much] less serious life felt [then] and how much more fun and present I was. I want to practice being more present, saying things out loud and not being afraid to be loud.

There's a magic and uniqueness in our child-selves that gets somewhat suppressed as we get older. What rituals or passions do you practice now as acts of self care for your health and well-being?

I love this question, because it brings me right back to the first one: I continue to write, skate and bowl. I just went skating this weekend, went bowling last week and write really often. I think these things always bring out the best me, always remind me of who I am and make me feel really good, even when I've hit a bump in my life.

Like Black History Month, this experience is a time of reflection, a celebration of how far we've come and an opportunity to to raise awareness of how much more work there is to do. What does Black History Month mean to you?

Black History Month, to me, means standing firm in your identity, loving what that looks like and not compromising who you are because of the systems that exist that try to steal those pieces of who you are from you.

Connecting with your younger self is a process and an ongoing journey. Do you remember what activities or passions you used to love when you were a child?

I poured myself into reading books and writing as a child. I honestly think I had more books than friends! There was something so captivating about travelling into these different inventive worlds and getting lost in plotlines that excited me, and even led me to trying to create my own miniseries and wanting to become a journalist. Though that career [dream] dwindled around the same time I was in Grade 10 English (not coincidental), my love for books remains the same.

If you could meet your child-self face to face today and have a conversation, what dreams would you reconnect with?

Travel, travel, travel. I wanted to travel extensively as a child, and I've knocked a few countries off my list, so I think my younger self and I would have a lot to catch up on.

What advice would you give to your younger self, knowing all that you know now?

I was very career-driven as a child. I wanted to be a journalist, a criminal lawyer, an astronomer, a chef, a famous singer/actress, a high school teacher, a political activist...I was super ambitious as a child, reading Maclean's best university guide regularly from eight years old.

That's not to say that I'm not ambitious now. But, as you get older, you start overanalyzing everything, weighing the financial consequences and rewards and talking yourself out of it only to chalk it up to being a ""realist.""

So the advice I'd tell myself would be to focus on one thing and do it. Doesn't matter how hard you think it'll be to accomplish or how much time you think it'd take because you're more than capable, passionate and intelligent. Also, don't give your mom such a hard time when you're a teen — you'll grow to be inspired by her badass-ness.

How does connecting with this inner child make you feel? Does it bring up certain thoughts or ideas, or reawaken any ambitions?

My inner child would tell my current self that you're exactly where you need to be. Everything you've set out to do, you've accomplished — and then some. Be proud, pat yourself on the back, and know that if you want it, you will get it.

There's a magic and uniqueness in our child-selves that gets somewhat suppressed as we get older. What rituals or passions do you practice now as acts of self care for your health and well-being?

Yoga, beauty rituals, engaging with art, laughing, cooking, dancing, crying and spending time with loved ones are all part of my self-care. I've enacted a new mantra that applies to all facets of my life from [the] social [to the] spiritual, emotional, and physical: ""quality, not quantity."" I don't want to live in excess, so it's important to me to know that I've purposely chosen to have the moments, things and people in my life [that I do].

Reconnecting with your inner child is a process for analyzing and understanding your roots. Like Black History Month, this experience is a time of reflection, a celebration of how far we've come and an opportunity to raise awareness of how much more work there is to do. What does Black History Month mean to you?

Pride and celebration.

Connecting with your younger self is a process and an ongoing journey. Do you remember what activities or passions you used to love when you were a child?

When I was a kid, I loved spending time with my mom. It was just me and her, and we were so close. We would go skating [and] go to the roller skating rink, and I was always adventurous, climbing trees and going into the creeks.

When you're a kid, you have so much freedom. You don't judge — you just know you're good enough as you are. It's only as we grow older that we become programmed to judge and compare ourselves [with others].

If you could meet your child-self face to face today and have a conversation, what dreams would you reconnect with?

My love language is gift-giving, and I can remember as a child I was always giving — buying small gifts and giving them to my friends, and trying to make my mom presents and pictures. As a kid, we're so connected and tuned into our spirit. We recognize what we're inherently good at and remember what an abundant world we live in — there is always more than enough.

Growing a business as a creator and personal development teacher, I've seen giving is the most rewarding thing you can do, and we each have gifts that we were born with. When we share those, it leads to ultimate freedom, fulfilling our purpose and meeting with our higher selves.

What advice would you give to your younger self, knowing all that you know now?

It's OK. You don't have to look or be like anyone else to be loved and accepted. You are good enough because you are here — no question about it. When the world seems confusing, look inward — that's where the answers are. Your universe is a reflection of everything you are: you are loving and supportive, and when you place your focus and attention there, you will attract that energy right back to you.

How does connecting with this inner child make you feel? Does it bring up certain thoughts or ideas, or reawaken any ambitions?

Take it easy on yourself. Laugh. Play.

There's a magic and uniqueness in our child-selves that gets somewhat suppressed as we get older. What rituals or passions do you practice now as acts of self care for your health and well-being?

I'm huge on discovering the power of the mind and our own energy that lives within us. I've turned showing people how to use their minds to manifest the life they want into my livelihood because it thrills me to help people transform and unlock things about themselves they forgot were there.

I give myself a lot of time to dream and imagine. We get taught in school not to imagine and, instead, to follow a textbook — to look outside of ourselves for the answers. My favourite practices involve going within: journalling, visualization, getting into the energy of gratitude and imaging my dream life — and then creating it. Taking time to be silent and tune in is essential for my mental well-being in a noisy world. It's finding this inner peace and reflection that allows me to be true to myself in everything I do.

Reconnecting with your inner child is a process for analyzing and understanding your roots. Like Black History Month, this experience is a time of reflection, a celebration of how far we've come and an opportunity to raise awareness of how much more work there is to do. What does Black History Month mean to you?

It wasn't that long ago that people of colour couldn't sit in the same places as others, get paid for their work or have basic civil rights. I'm able to live a life of freedom and choice because of people who fought for me, who I can never personally thank. Black History Month reminds us to stick to our dreams, and that change can happen fast when we have a dream. A single person can inspire change in millions.

It's a reminder to me to be grateful for all the opportunities I have because someone sacrificed for generations...and a reminder to do my part to encourage a world of higher consciousness and inclusion for those who will come after me.",What would you say to your younger self? 6 Black Canadian women celebrate their inner child,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/arts/what-would-you-say-to-your-younger-self-6-black-canadian-women-celebrate-their-inner-child-1.5035465

The new curriculum is more political than educational and ...,"Do you think Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should resign over the SNC-Lavalin affair?

By Letter to the Editor on February 28, 2019.

The Alberta Minister of Education continues to ignore the rising criticism of his new curriculum.

Minister Eggen claims that 100,000 Albertans provided feedback for the writing of these documents. When was that? Developed in secret, the public only heard of invited feedback from the minister in June 2018, well after department minions had written the majority of the documents. And, no substantial changes occurred after that.

So, where did that 100,000 person feedback come from? Ironically, 18,000 signatures on a petition decrying the appalling methodology recommended in the math curriculum were ignored. Numerous recommendations from post-secondary institutions requesting a higher knowledge and skills content in math and other subjects were ignored.

The proposed social studies curriculum is simply a template for social engineering. The Edmonton Journal and other media have pointed out the lack of any substantial study related to Alberta and Canadian history in this curriculum. But it does include in-depth study of aboriginal stories and spiritual beliefs designed to raise one-sided questions about current environmental values.

As a teacher of English language arts for 23 years, I challenge the public and fellow teachers to find measurable objectives in the “edu-jargon” of the English language arts curriculum.

Finally, Minister Eggan’s half truth, claiming a 30-year stagnation of current curriculum demanded this change, is also deceitful. For the past 20 years alternative programs within the public system along with charter and private schools have tweaked curriculum with designed experimental improvements to curriculum, that have raised their student achievement results to among the highest in Alberta, indeed Canada.

He has ignored them and instead seeks through decreased funding commitments to silence their input completely. So who exactly has been consulted? Selected special-interest lobby groups come to mind?

Finally, in the published “Framework for Curriculum Development” it comes as no surprise that the curriculum vision for Alberta students does not include the characteristic “knowledgeable,” it focuses almost exclusively on “social relationships” and “progressivist values.”

The new curriculum is more political than educational and will only serve to replace student thinking and debate with indoctrinated values.

316,,2019-02-26T22:31:00.0000000Z,"As a Venezuelan who was separated from her family due to the political catastrophe brought about by Hugo ... Canada’s intervention in Venezuela’s affairs is not an “extension of Canadian colonialism,” but rather an initiative to protect Venezuela ...","Millions of Venezuelans everywhere have been celebrating Venezuela’s progress after Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader and elected representative of the National Assembly, was recognized as the interim president of the country on January 23, 2019. This event in history gives Venezuelans the hope that one day, they will achieve economic, social and political stability and prosperity under democratic rule.

For these reasons, I find that the UBC Social Justice Centre has failed to fully evaluate and analyze the political situation in a recently posted letter outlining its opposition to Canada’s intervention in Venezuela. I hope the perspective provided in this response is successful in encouraging the writers of the letter to reconsider their opinion.

As seen by many, the Venezuelan government under Maduro’s rule was elected, but through a highly manipulated electoral system that is only partially “democratic” under the corrupt dictatorship. Although elections were hosted, Maduro exiled or banned the opposition from running. In other words, the elections that declared him president were undoubtedly illegitimate. This means that Canada and US efforts to “destabilize and overthrow” the regime are supportive of Venezuela’s path to achieving free and valid elections in the future. It is important to understand that what is happening in Venezuela is not a “US-led coup against the elected government of Nicolas Maduro.” The great majority of Venezuelans are struggling to rid the country of a dictatorship in pursuit of just and truly democratic elections. Therefore, Venezuela’s situation is not comparable to the Ottawa Initiative because the support of Canada and the US is not in favour of a planned coup as stated in the letter. Instead, it is a first step in helping Venezuela restore its democratic system through ""peaceful and negotiated means."" They are supporting the democracy that has been mocked by Nicolas Maduro after he allegedly hosted fraudulent elections, which were highly condemned at an international level, in order to claim a second term of presidency for six years.

In my opinion, recognizing Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president exemplifies the interest of the international community to improve the political situation rather than “[interfering] in the sovereignty of Venezuela” because a nation governed by tyranny does not qualify as sovereign under any circumstances. Needless to say, many Venezuelans are extremely grateful for Canada’s support. The US and EU, along with all Latin American governments are also in favour of the democracy that is currently represented by deputy Juan Guaidó.

As for the critique on Canada’s sanctions against the Venezuelan government, it should be noted that Canada’s restrictions outlined in the Special Economic Measures Act and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Regulations are to pressure Maduro to relinquish their fraudulent government. Restricting dealings and support of a corrupted ruler is in no manner “cruel and inhumane,” but rather reflective of Canada’s interest in helping Venezuela attain the justice that it deserves.

As a Venezuelan who was separated from her family due to the political catastrophe brought about by Hugo Chavez and Maduro, I wrote this response on behalf of all Venezuelans that have been offended and disrespected by the letter. Canada’s intervention in Venezuela’s affairs is not an “extension of Canadian colonialism,” but rather an initiative to protect Venezuela and its people as well as provide humanitarian aid to a nation that has been suffering for too long without international support. This decision illustrates Canada’s values of eradicating anti-oppression at a global level, progressive social change and equity among individuals; a concern that the Social Justice Centre claims is their objective for the organization.

Venezuelans currently living in the country are struggling with drastic food, electricity and water shortages, leaving entire families unable to satisfy their basic necessities; they have been so focused on surviving that they have forgotten how to live. Those who live abroad are struggling to cope with the separation from their home and families, sacrificing everything that holds the most value in order to seek an opportunity for a better life.

The underlying focus of this letter is not to condemn the Social Justice Centre, but rather to serve as a reminder of the importance of considering all aspects of a political issue before formulating an opinion. Ensuring thorough research into a problem with which there is little familiarity is crucial to avoid publishing a piece that is supported by subjective bias instead of concrete evidence. While it is evident that an offense against Venezuelans was not the intention of the letter, it is necessary to engage in further discussion of the topic to prevent future misinterpretations of another country’s affairs.
